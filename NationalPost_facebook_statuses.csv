110225254594_10154834915183594,"Financial Post's Garry Marr shares what he thinks were the top real estate stories of this year:

What if you kept making the same prediction over and over again and it never came true?

That's the dilemma for housing naysayers who have been calling for some type of meaningful correction for more than a decade. It hasn't happened on a national level, unless you consider a 0.7 per cent reduction in prices in 2008 a crash. Individual markets always tell their own story and price reductions are now underway in cities like Vancouver and Calgary.

Even the Canadian Real Estate Association, which represents over 110,000 realtors, now says the housing boom can't go on. The Ottawa-based group is forecasting housing sales to drop by 3.3 per cent next year after a record 2016.

On the price front, 2016 should see a record average price of $489,500 but CREA says prices will drop 3.3 per cent next year.

What's changing? The fear of a rising rate environment was starting to materialize late in 2016 – albeit in small way.

The bigger threat seems to be tougher mortgage rules out of Ottawa which will make it even harder for first-time buyers to qualify for a loan and potentially snuff out a housing market that has been on fire for almost a decade and half.",Top real estate stories of 2016,video,https://www.facebook.com/NationalPost/videos/10154834915183594/,2016-12-20 12:16:17,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
110225254594_10154834866953594,"Financial Post's Hollie Shaw looks at some of the top retail stories from this past year:

2016 was a decent year for Canadian retailers, though not all categories performed equally. 

Clothing sales grew just two per cent over the course of the year, while people continued to spend money on feathering their nests — Ikea's sales rose more 14 per cent in the year ending Aug. 31, and Leon's rose more than four per cent at stores open for more than a year by the end of September. 

Grocery companies also fared well despite increasingly heightened competition from Costco Wholesale Canada and Walmart Canada, with the exception of Sobeys, which is still recovering from its bumpy takeover of the Safeway chain in 2013. 

Some major acquisitions that happened in 2016 will shape the retail market in Canada for years to come — pharmacy chain Rexall was acquired by its longtime drug distributor, U.S. health-care services and technology giant McKesson Corp., in a move that will give the national retailer deeper pockets to battle Loblaw-owned Shoppers Drug Mart. And Rona accepted a much sweeter bid in 2016 from rival U.S. home improvement chain Lowe's— $3.2 billion — after the Quebec-based retailer had rejected its hostile $1.76 billion bid in 2012.",Top retail stories of 2016,video,https://www.facebook.com/NationalPost/videos/10154834866953594/,2016-12-20 11:47:47,3,2,3,3,0,0,0,0,0

The story in tech that really jumps from 2016 is the exploding Galaxy Note 7 from Samsung Mobile. Not only did the recall cost Samsung billions of dollars, but also there is the revenue lost from potential sales and damage to the company's brand.

Consumers who purchased the Note 7 weren't the only group to feel the effects of the recall either. People traveling on flights would constantly hear about the phones being banned, for example. The story also spilled over into entertainment, becoming the punch line for jokes from comedians and all the up to President Obama.

Another big story of the year is the battle for consumer music streaming dollars. The war heated up significantly with both Apple and Google overhauling their music streaming services in different ways to try to compete with the industry juggernaut that is Spotify.

Finally, consumers got more great choices this year from various companies. Google released its first Pixel phone made entirely in-house, Microsoft's Surface line of devices continue to gain traction and Apple revamped its MacBook Pro line as well as iPhone.

110225254594_10154831963523594,"Financial Post's Barbara Shecter talks about the top stories of the year in the financial sector:

Two major trends took hold in the Canadian banking sector in 2016.
 
At the beginning of the year, and persisting as the banks reported each financial quarter, investors were watching intently to see how the lenders would deal with the impact of low oil prices on their loans books and in their capital markets divisions.
 
Bank executives urged calm, even as the price of oil appeared poised to stay ""low for long,"" and provisions for credit losses rose. By the end of the year, the oil-related concerns began to wane, as the banks continued to report profit growth for the most part.
 
Even RBC, which saw a two per cent decline in net income in the fourth quarter, managed to boost full-year profits by four per cent to nearly $10.5 billion.
 
The past year was also characterized by more partnerships between the banks and financial technology, or fintech, firms. The fintechs were initially viewed as competitors for customers who wanted to do more of their banking services – including borrowing, paying, and trading -- online.
 
But, over the past twelve months, co-operation between the big banks and fintechs included Scotiabank teaming up with Atlanta-based fintech lender Kabbage to offer small business loans to the Canadian bank's clients in Canada and Mexico.
 
Also last year, Scotia and CIBC deepened their funding relationship with Montreal-based business lender Thinking Capital, and CIBC joined forces with consumer lender Borrowell.",Top stories of 2016 in the financial sector,video,https://www.facebook.com/NationalPost/videos/10154831963523594/,2016-12-19 12:46:04,7,3,1,7,0,0,0,0,0

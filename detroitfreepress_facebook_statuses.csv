Because of the presidential candidate who will be elected today.
Because of the school board candidate who will be elected president a generation from today.
Because the whole world is watching.
Because our sons and daughters are watching.
Because this time, there's way more than a dime's worth of difference.
Because of those who've died.
Because of those who might not have died, if more people had voted.
Because those who will are sure you won't.
Because those who can't cannot fathom why you wouldn't.
Because you're not a kid anymore.
Because you want your kids to grow up in a community, state and country they can be proud of.
Because it's the minimum obligation — the minimum — of those of us privileged to live in a free society.
Because it's your sacred duty.
Because it's obscene just to watch.

She sees what development can mean in the house where she lives on Webb near Woodward in the Gateway community. The homeowner has restored a once dilapidated house into a home for herself and a friend, and an African-inspired showpiece for the neighborhood.

She attributes progress in Detroit to self-determination on the part of its residents.

""I see more community farms and more communities, and I'm starting to see more black-owned businesses. I'm starting to see communities rise, it seems like, in certain neighborhoods. That's what I'm bearing witness to; I know in mine that's what I see taking place.

""In this neighborhood … I've noticed that more businesses, more African-American-owned businesses are starting to become present. More people are starting to interact with each other and communicate more, like building a trust. ... We need that in order to be a community.""

13642915529_10153905787270530,"For 30 years, Michael Berry has gone to church in the Tireman neighborhood, on the city's west side. He lives there now, too, for the last 10 or so  years.

""There's a lot of illegal activity throughout the neighborhood. There are a lot of police patrolling, and they do what they can do. You can't fault them for anything. It's just the environment, you know?"" he said. ""At one time this place was pretty dangerous. It's not the safest neighborhood in the world, but by far it's not the worst.""

This summer, Berry and his brother were cutting grass in one of the block's vacant lots.

""These two guys walk past me, one of them was throwing up like he was sick. ... A car pulls up, and a guy gets out with a high-powered rifle, the other with a handgun. I jumped off the riding mower and run for cover. ... They didn't run, they just casually, like they were delivering pizza or something, casually drove away. Got into the car and drove off.""

But he's not afraid in the neighborhood. His church serves meals to folks in need, and Berry says that helps forge connections.

""We're real nice to the people. We treat them like human beings, laugh with them, kid with them. ... They're good people,"" he said.

And Berry thinks things are likely to get worse. The city's bankruptcy, he says, was a raw deal. ""I think they still had time. There was too much politics involved.""

But he doesn't think Detroit is out.

""I'm going to be honest with you, my honest opinion. I can only say it one way. In my personal opinion, (former Mayor) Coleman Young turned this city into a ghost town. A lot of businesses left the city. ... (Former Mayor) Dennis Archer did what he could do. ... He didn't have the manpower or the political backing he needed, but he did his best. (Former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, now in federal prison), well, he literally raped us. It was all about him. (Former Mayor) Dave Bing is not a politician. He is a businessman, true, but not a politician. I have faith in (current Mayor) Mike Duggan. I think he's going to bring us out of this rut.""

13642915529_10153905782335530,"Charles Simmons has watched the city's neighborhoods collapse even as people praise the rebirth of the city's downtown.

""The economic system here is the underground economy,"" said the 73-year-old college professor. ""People do whatever they can to survive. I know of a family where the children have to wait until their mother comes back home from prostituting so they can wear her clothes to school. So we're talking about poverty of a Third World type. I mean, in the lowest of the Third World type, in the richest country in the world.""

About a decade ago, he and his wife turned their Wabash Street home into Hush House, a community center and museum of Jim Crow memorabilia and black history that despite its obscurity has drawn tourists from around the world.

They've fought home foreclosures, water shutoffs and illegal dumping in their west-side neighborhood, and for years have tried to organize and engage the community to take charge in shaping their own futures. It will take countless community gathering places like theirs, Simmons said, to truly revitalize the whole city.

""The problems won't be solved just from the top, thinking we've got to have a general plan for the entire city,"" he said. ""The people have to get out of those administrative offices and come to the neighborhood and talk to the people and see what they need and see how it can be fixed. Everybody needs to participate in the discussion about what needs to be done.""

He's wearing safety goggles and a hard hat for his job as manager of D-Town Farm, a sprawling community farm on seven acres in Rouge Park on the city's northwest side.

Tending the farm isn't just work for Sennefer Ra, 37. It's a way to tend to the city that raised him.

""I'm here to do this community work, support this nonprofit and also to be an example to the youth,"" says Sennefer Ra, who lives in the Schultz neighborhood near the Northwest Activities Center in #Detroit. ""I had a pretty challenging and troubled childhood, and I was able to focus myself and make changes in my life.""

He's conflicted about the changes he sees in the city he loves.

""There's pros and cons,"" he says. ""You can see the difference within the transit system and our garbage disposal system being privatized.""

""It's difficult. I mean there's a lot of people suffering, living in despair at this time because of the systemic structure and they — without basically declaring it — they have through their actions shown who are the unwanted people.

""I believe there's a campaign or agenda to rid the unwanted people. There is a campaign on criminalizing the poor. They are basically making it so it's unaffordable for the people that's been here to stay. They're making way for new development for people to come in who have better economic resources. They have capacity. There's not a lot of jobs here.

""In one instance it's changing for the better for a select group of people. For the rest, people are hurting economically.

""Definitely you can see changes, and I guess you just have to have your head on straight to see where things are headed and strive to ride the wave; put yourself in the best position to leverage the changes taking place, instead of necessarily making excuses and just saying, 'This is happening! This is happening!' But we have a responsibility.""

13642915529_10153897849685530,"Before Waliur Rahman, 42, came to the U.S., back in 1989, he knew the names of only two American towns: Morristown, Pa., and Detroit. His father chose Detroit.

Rahman, executive director of the North Detroit Islamic Center, lives and works in Detroit's growing BanglaTown, south of Davison near McDougall Street on the city's east side. In 1989, he says, the neighborhood was safe. Then it got worse. And now it's getting better.

""We have taken the initiative to bring back this community,"" he said. ""This community at one time became a very dangerous community, a hazardous community, was a dumping place for many communities and many people. ... There was a time the women, especially our community women, were scared to walk on the street. Now they do walk on the street, they go here and there, walking from neighbor to neighbor.

""... We took the initiative as an organization to clean the neighborhood. We bought abandoned buildings and demolished them with own money. If you walk through this neighborhood you will see it actually very clean — so much debris, tires, we cleaned those things.

""... It's much safer, but we're not there yet.""

Support from District 3 City Councilman Scott Benson and Mayor Mike Duggan has helped, Rahman said.

Now, he said, the reason people move is high property taxes and car insurance.

With the city's bankruptcy in the past, Rahman hopes city officials will have more resources for the city's neighborhoods.

""They need to pay attention to the neighborhoods, to community development, how to reduce property taxes, bring good insurance companies so people can stay in the community. A lot of time people have a hard time to stay here. They go to the other side of 8 Mile, find a house, a good safe house, low property tax, good insurance ... (they say) why stay here when I have opportunities on the other side?""

As for Rahman, he hopes more people — Bangladeshi or not — move to BanglaTown.

""When I see a neighborhood or I see a community, diversity is most important here,"" he said. ""I want to see all races, all religions here, all conversations, all cultures in here. It helps. This is the beauty of community.""

13642915529_10153897839695530,"Maxwell House coffee cans.

That's where Estella Rice-Pitts' daddy put the money he saved from working in the auto plants and the post office.

He used that money in 1969 to buy the house on Mt. Elliott where he and his wife raised their five children, the second black family in what was then a neighborhood so safe kids played in the alley out back.

Rice-Pitts kids' grew up there, too.

About four years ago, the family lost the house. It became a victim of the crime and disrepair that choked the life out of the once-vibrant east-side Detroit neighborhood. Houses sat empty and abandoned.

Vandals stripped the house. People dumped old furniture, tires and tons of trash on the land where Rice-Pitts' mother used to plant collard greens, peppers, tomatoes, onions and more.

But in February, Rice-Pitts, 58, got the house back. She moved back into the house with her ailing mother, Cecelia Pitts, 73, and two of her sons, both in their early 20s. Rice-Pitts believes moving back into the house was just the tonic her mother needs to heal physical and emotional ailments that left her confined to bed for three years. Her dad passed in 1997.

In the few months since she has been back in the house, she has been filled with hope for the neighborhood she grew up in and the city she loves. New people are moving in, and she estimates about 25 abandoned homes have been torn down.

""By them tearing down houses, I feel even more safe,"" she says. "" 'Cause you know abandoned houses, one time somebody tried to snatch this lady I know in the building around here. They (empty buildings) gone now, so it's a blessing. It's clean, so it feels safe. I don't gotta worry about nobody bothering my mama.

""Got peace of mind. Definitely got peace of mind.""

She and her sons work diligently to keep the place clean inside and out. She washes laundry daily and hangs it to dry on lines out back, just like her mama did when she grew up there.

""Everybody know me, they say you always washing,"" says Rice-Pitts, who's disabled by heart and lung diseases. She used to work in home health care.

""I wash everything every single day. You ain't never gonna smell no pee on my mama.""

"" 'Cause you live in the hood, it ain't got to look like the hood. Wherever you live, you make it comfortable and you keep it clean. It don't matter if it's just one house standing, you keep it up.""

She's hopeful about the city's future. ""I believe everything gonna be real nice. It's gonna blow up. Everybody moving way out. They need to stay right where you came from and fix it up. Don't stop. Don't give up. That's the best thing. ... My daddy always said, don't forget where you came from, and it's been in my heart and mind always.""

""Too many vacant houses. Don't just have a vacant house sitting up there. Just knock it down or rebuild it. Do something with it,"" said the 27-year-old coney island manager. ""We have young women getting raped and found dead in vacant properties and stuff. That's like giving somebody the OK — a sick-minded person — the OK to drag somebody in here and catch somebody walking home from school, pull you in a vacant house. … Either you knock the property down or rebuild it, instead of just letting it sit right there. I think that's a danger to me.""

She stays in two places — an apartment in Highland Park and her family home on Holmur near the Lodge Freeway. She says neighborhoods need more attention from the city.

""It might not be a problem for everybody, but for me it's a problem. Because I have two daughters, you know — 1 and 5. ... So I be watching everything. Keep my eyes on everybody, watching everything. Shouldn't have to live like that.""

""I woke up at about 6 in the morning. I guess we're all pretty familiar with the sounds in our neighborhood, and I heard a car start that I'd never heard before. It was a real noisy car. And I looked outside,"" said Swope, 30. ""I looked at my car and I actually didn't believe it. I had to go downstairs and look out through a different window. But it was sitting out in front of my house on blocks. On very small blocks. It was very carefully balanced, actually. So I figured maybe they were professionals, they'd done it before. And that was last week.""

He has lived in Detroit for a decade, and his house on Lichfield near Pembroke in the Green Acres neighborhood is his second home in the city. He and his wife spend ""date nights"" joining the neighborhood private security patrol a couple of times a month.

""It's horrible,"" he said of the tire theft. ""I feel invaded, really, you know what I mean? It's like it makes it harder to sleep because you want to get up, look out the window, make sure no one's trying to steal your stuff.

""It's difficult, to be honest with you. But it hasn't deterred me. I'm not moving or anything like that, so … I have a lot of hope for Detroit. I think that a lot of people are really taking interest in Detroit in a way that puts it in a more positive light. I think a lot of people want to invest in Detroit. Like myself, I actually want to invest in Detroit, and be a small-business owner. I think it's a great place to do it because you don't get priced out too easily. And it's very business friendly.

""I think once people start coming to Detroit more often and experiencing it as a real city and not a myth … I grew up in the suburbs and the way people talked about Detroit was, 'Don't go there.' You know what I mean? Coming down here I was like, 'Why not?' I don't get it. And I think there's a lot more of that, especially with a younger generation of kids who come to Detroit and hang out here and everything, and understand that there's a lot of myth surrounding this city.

Rodgers, 63, says she has to now. The house she and her husband occupy was built in 1920s. She grew up on this street, but not in this house.

""I've been living here since I was 5 years old. When I first moved here, it was a whole beautiful neighborhood. Houses were everywhere. All different types of people lived on the street,"" said Rodgers.

Her father worked at the steel factory on Zug Island. Everything the family needed was just a block away on West Jefferson. The footprint for the new Gordie Howe International Bridge will not take her home, but the city's depopulation, blight and economic ruin has long destroyed her neighborhood. The only business left nearby is a bar. She used to work at a dry cleaners nearby. The store closed. The building became vacant, was torched and torn down a few years ago.

""It's been a devastating change,"" said Rodgers. ""It went from being a nice neighborhood to an abandoned forest.""

The city's improved financial bottom line, because bankruptcy wiped out so much debt, hasn't made any noticeable difference to her. Unexpectedly, the bulldozed landscape, dotted with commercial wreckage, feels strangely comforting.

""I don't have a choice. I have to stay here. This is all I know,"" said Rodgers. ""I feel safer here. You hear a lot of things on the west side and the east side, I know they have a lot of nice homes in certain parts, but it's quieter down here.""

Except when a neighboring house is sometimes occupied, ""we're the only ones here,"" said Rodgers. ""But I've got two dogs and a shotgun,"" she laughs.

She grows quiet. ""I never felt lonely like I do now.""

13642915529_10153898390285530,"Donald (Tony) Hudson, 64, who retired from the #Detroit Police Department in December 2013 after 39 years of service, said the city's bankruptcy initially drove up his own costs by roughly $1,000 a month to pay for health coverage for himself and his wife.

""The expense of health care is cutting into the quality of my life,"" said Hudson, who lives in the city's historic Rosedale Park neighborhood.

Police and fire retirees did not face cuts to pension checks, but they lost half of their annual cost-of-living adjustments. The hit was significant to health care coverage, especially for retirees who are under age 65 and not covered by Medicare. For that reason, some younger police and fire retirees under age 65 went back to work. Many retired cops pick up jobs for health care, financial advisers said.

But Hudson said his costs will go down when he turns 65 and is covered by Medicare.

""And believe me, I'm looking forward to it,"" said Hudson.

Downtown looks better with the light-rail project, the new Red Wings stadium that's in the works, and the growth in the downtown area, he said. But the city still suffers elsewhere.

""I don't see any improvement in the neighborhood,"" he said.

""We didn't have streetlights on my block for five or six years,"" Hudson said. Now, streetlights have been added, but two streetlights replaced what formerly had been three streetlights. He complains that his area is still pitch black. He's had cars stolen out of his backyard, and the tires taken off of them.

He has no plans to move out of the home where they raised their family. His three adult children live in Dearborn, Ann Arbor and Southfield.

""I enjoy living in Rosedale Park,"" he said, noting that he bought the house 38 years ago. ""We've got good neighbors.""

But he's hopeful that positive changes will evolve over time in Detroit.

""I think in three to five years Detroit will be in a much better position,"" Hudson said. He says it could take 10 years or 20 years for Detroit to truly make a full comeback to its better days.

""I'll be long gone, but Detroit's going to be a great city again.""

13642915529_10153897606035530,"Carol Coleman, 60, will tell you that, by and large, the neighborhood she has lived in for decades is safe. There's little crime. And as far back as anyone can remember, there has been only one murder.

The victim was her daughter.

It was 2006, and Coleman's daughter Takela had just gotten off work. She'd put her 14-month-old son, the younger of her two kids, down for the night, and Coleman, Takela and Coleman's nephew were bantering about a job Takela had been offered in Kentucky.

""She was laughing, 'I'm out of here Thursday, I'm gone,' 'cause she had a job in Kentucky. She was a chef and she had a job offer in Kentucky; she was planning on leaving. I didn't know she was supposed to be gone the day of the shooting. But things happen.

""She walked past me (and out the door) and by the time I got to that door, I heard some shots. It was the 29th of July, so I thought it was fireworks. … My son is like, 'Mama, Takela been shot.' I was like, 'Boy, what are you talking about?' He said, 'Takela been shot.' I said, 'Boy what are you TALKING about?'

""Then I had her two kids and they all started screaming. Everybody started screaming, and I said 'OK, Carol, compose yourself. OK, Carol, you've got to stay calm. And I got the kids together. I called 911. All circuits were busy. All circuits. I tried about three or four calls. All circuits were busy.

""I just told them to get her put in her car, so I took her to Henry Ford Hospital. So they did. She was dead on arrival, but they resuscitated her.

""By the time the police came — they came about a half hour after the incident — and then they were talking about why she was moved? This is my child. I called and all circuits were busy, so what do you mean why she was moved? Officer, this is my child. So a half an hour after this the police came, half an hour after that, the ambulance came. … OK. That was a crazy night. Really.

""I can't believe all circuits were busy in a big city like this. That's what really pissed me off because we not getting the service we paid for. That was in 2006, I don't know if it's changed.""

Doctors resuscitated Takela, but she was left quadriplegic. Coleman spent the next five years caring for Takela and her two young children, the baby and a 10-year-old daughter.

And she stayed put.

""I didn't think about moving. I just prayed, I just prayed, and I kept good faith,"" she said. ""To uproot myself — my home was paid for. So I was like, I got to raise two more kids, so to start all over would not be fun. Besides, neighborhood is still great, despite upkeep, and the foreclosures, and the $500 homes.""

Coleman's mother used to live in the neighborhood, and it was beautiful back then — many of the residents were elderly, and took terrific care of their properties. Coleman recalls Christmas displays that drew sightseers from surrounding neighborhoods — Christmas in Wonderland, she calls it.

Then the street's elderly residents moved out, or passed away, and neither the renters who replaced them nor the landlords who, by right, should be keeping up Calvert Street did what they ought.

Like the man who shot Takela — his grandmother had moved in six months before, he'd been there just three months.

""He moved in there, and changed the whole life of everybody on the street,"" Coleman said. ""You can't say she was at the wrong place at the wrong time, you can't say she was someplace she wasn't supposed to be.""

Takela lived for five years after the shooting, something Coleman says she's grateful for — the baby, now a boy of 10, got to know his mother, and Coleman, she got a few more years with her only daughter.

Takela's killer got 65 years. It wasn't his first offense.

""Life, you hear about it on TV, but you never know when it's going to come knocking at your door,"" Coleman said. ""The only thing that kept me standing is faith.""

13642915529_10153897596985530,"Gunshots and wailing police sirens are distant memories for Kevin Rigby Jr., who grew up in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood.

But they're also a harsh reminder of the ongoing struggles of the residents he believes have been left behind after Detroit's bankruptcy.

Rigby, 21, lived on the city's east side, near 7 Mile and Ryan, for 18 years before moving to Sherwood Forest at 7 Mile and Livernois with his family. After the move, he became keenly aware of stark differences in some of the city's neighborhoods.

""I first kind of got some reflection when I moved to Sherwood Forest,"" Rigby said. ""I remember my first night there it was so quiet. I was used to police sirens, horns, loud music and occasional gunshots. As I started college, that reflection only got keener. Going through bankruptcy, we saw how areas like where I lived weren't being talked about and that the investment was being planned for other areas compared to where I grew up. Very little had changed there.""

Rigby now lives in New Center and is a senior at Wayne State University majoring in African-American studies. He said the demographics of where he lives have quickly changed in the year since the bankruptcy. Rigby said some apartment buildings near him have rental rates starting well above $1,000. He pays $465 a month — for now.

""I live right there on that edge of downtown, Midtown and New Center,"" he said. ""More and more people are moving into this area. There are more students, particularly white students, moving into the area, but when I first moved in my whole building was black.""

Rigby said one of his main issues with the bankruptcy is the narrative he believes was perpetuated by local and national media outlets.

""The mainstream media kind of proliferated this kind of impending doom, and now we've gone through it,"" he said. ""And we came out. Now that we're coming out of it, there's this whole language of revitalization, a rebirth, a new Detroit. I think that's strange and very dangerous.

""I spend most of my time in this area and specifically in the Midtown area, which used to be Cass Corridor and used to house a lot of homeless and poor people. Now when you walk around here they're nowhere to be found. I think about what happened to the people that were here and where they've gone. Are they included in the language of revitalization? It's very obvious that they aren't.""

Rigby criticized the crop of expensive restaurants, bike shops and other businesses, which he believes aren't necessarily for most Detroiters.

""All of these things count as beneficial or credit toward a functioning city for young, highly educated people from outside the city coming in,"" he said. ""But we don't talk about what a functioning city looks like for people who are already here and for the people who had to suffer through decades of disinvestment and everything else that led us to the bankruptcy.""

13642915529_10153897592535530,"When he learned how to fix bicycles, Antoine Hill learned a few lessons about the southwest #Detroit neighborhood where he has spent all his 19 years.

Through community nonprofit Urban Neighborhood Initiatives, he was introduced to the Earn-A-Bike program. That led to him working as an assistant manager in the Southwest Rides bike store, a 2-year-old business on Springwells, south of Vernor.

Now he helps run the Earn-A-Bike program. Neighborhood young people ages 10 to 17 pick out bikes — mostly used — donated to the program. Over six weeks, the kids learn bike mechanics and how to fix them up. And the bike they fix is the bike they take home, along with a helmet.

""You can see it sparks something. And that's always a great feeling because they start off not knowing much, and they walk away with all this knowledge and a bike they built up, with the help of yourself,"" said Hill.

The young people ask if they can help out with the next class ""because they see it as something positive.""

""They want to keep giving back,"" said Hill. Just like he wants to.

Three days before Thanksgiving, Hill began classes at the Detroit Police Academy. In five months, he's aiming to graduate and join the force.

""I feel that it's taking the same skills that I've learned,"" said Hill, ""… and kind of applying them on a wider scale, not only with youth, but with adults, and applying that effective communication I have and just getting things done.

""The force will need a lot of police officers with my mind-set. I'm not trying to sound too conceited. But I know there are a lot of bad police officers out there, and I know I'm not going to be one of those.""

""Fit & Fold is a laundromat where you can work out and wash your clothes. It has a full-body gym, you see,"" said Cornelius, 59. ""It takes the washers 30 minutes to wash and the person has the opportunity to get fit while they're washing their clothes.""

The building had been abandoned for 20 years before a local community development corporation bought it from Wayne County.

The vacant building was put into service through the Central Detroit Christian. It has 18 washers, 19 dryers, and full-body cardio exercise machines and stationary bikes. It's $4 for the big washers to handle comforters; $2 for regular loads.

""I do see improvement. Well, for one, I'm employed. So that's a great improvement,"" said Cornelius. When families come in on weekends, Cornelius helps engage the kids by reading to them.

When new customers arrive, ""they're totally in awe — 'Wow! Who thought of this?' "" is how Cornelius describes their reactions. ""We run a drug-free establishment. No hangouts. Nobody loitering or anything like that. It's a pretty safe place where you can do your clothes and have peace of mind. And, also again, exercise. Work out while you wash.

""Things are getting better. We have new lights, outside, finally, on Second Street. We're in a well-lit neighborhood now. It was very black and bleak and things like that. But things are picking up, picking up very well,"" said Cornelius.

""There are new people coming into the neighborhood. New houses are coming up. New renovations are coming up. And hopefully we'll have a garden coming up across the street this spring.""

""That's how it goes,"" said the 55-year-old. ""You keep things looking decent around your house. We're motivated and like our stuff to look right around here.""

His new house on Dobel Street, near Van Dyke and East McNichols on the city's east side, has iron bars on the windows and doors. He moved here five years ago, he says, after his old house across town was firebombed by drug dealers as he and his family slept inside. It was payback for him harassing them.

His hopes for the future of his new neighborhood, and for the city itself, are simple.

""Take out crack, take out abandoned houses and start telling young fellas to pull up their pants and stay in school so they do better and get a better job,"" he said.

""You see that big sign there?"" he asked, pointing to a neighborhood watch sign. ""That means something. They watch my back when I'm gone, I watch their back when they're gone.""

■ Wipe down cell phones, office phones and keyboards frequently. The same goes for door handles and other commonly-shared surfaces.

■ Be conscious of sharing cell phones. Whether it's using them to make a call or flipping through pictures or texts, the surfaces can contain countless germs.

■ It may be difficult at holiday gatherings, but resist the temptation to share silverware or otherwise taste food on another person's plate.

■ Whether it's colleagues or holiday guests, take extra precautions to keep hands away from your face after shaking hands or in other ways physically greeting them.

■ When leaving the bathroom, use a paper towel — or your sleeve if a paper towel isn't available — to open doors.

■ When hand-washing isn't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Keep it handy for you, holiday guests and coworkers.

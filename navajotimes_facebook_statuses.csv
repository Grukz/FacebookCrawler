Added Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II, ""President Trump is legally required to honor our treaty rights and provide a fair and reasonable pipeline process.

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

KAIBETO, Ariz. – Bureau of Indian Affairs maintenance workers are working to shut off a water supply to the Kaibeto School campus while water from a water tower is leaking, causing a nearby flooded dirt road.

Water from one of two water towers here is currently leaking through three holes. But the maintenance workers from the school do not know how and when it happened.

""We just got called in and now we're doing what we can,"" said maintenance worker Herbert Welch, who along with Carlton Tsinnijinnie, were called to the leak site on Sunday morning. ""We don't know how it happened.""

Residents though say someone shot at the water towers after they heard several consecutive gunshots around 9:30 p.m. 
Biaonca Nez, a campus resident who lives adjacent to the water towers, said she was hosting a family game night when she and her family heard gunshots.

""They sounded like the gun violence in movies,"" Nez said as she described the noise.

Nez said her family this morning was informed of the water leaks and that the water supply to their home would be turned off today for maintenance.

The maintenance workers say they do not know how much water had been released from the tower that was erected in the late seventies, when Kaibeto Boarding School was built. The other tower was erected four years ago, according to Welch.

Tsinnijinnie said the water towers each carry around 250,000 gallons of water and shutting down one would not affect the campus nor its residents.

The leak has caused a small flood on Navajo Route 6331, and the cold weather has caused ice to build up on the tower and on the fence that enclose the water towers.",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10154748287921233/?type=3,2017-01-22 17:45:33,327,84,177,133,0,41,2,53,98

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau
 

​TS'AHBIIKIN, Ariz. – The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for northern Arizona. And the wet weekend has already begun.
​""Indeed, we've a significant winter storm,"" said Brian A. Klimowski, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service in Bellemont, Arizona. ""And it's going to impact northern Arizona starting Thursday (Jan. 19) and will continue through Monday (Jan. 23) with a couple of breaks in between.""
​The winter storm warning was issued Wednesday, Jan. 18, for several areas, including the Coconino and Kaibab plateaus, northern Gila and Yavapai counties, Grand Canyon, eastern and western Mogollon Rim, White Mountain, and Oak Creek and Sycamore canyons.
​Klimowski told the Navajo Times that the warning is in effect for most of northern Arizona above 5,500 feet that started this morning (Jan. 19) and will extend through noon on Saturday, Jan. 21.
​An extended period of snow has started above 5,500 feet with heavy snow accumulation by Saturday afternoon, said Klimowski. The snow level is going to fluctuate a bit between 4,800 and 5,500 feet.
​""But in general, it's above 5,500 feet that we're looking for the greatest accumulation,"" Klimowski said.
​The storm will come in two punches.
​The first one, which already started, will continue through tonight. And the second one, a much more significant storm will start later on Friday, Jan. 20 and continue into Saturday morning.
​""The second storm … will have the greatest impact in most areas,"" Klimowski said. ""It's going to have slightly slower snow levels and heavier precipitations.""
​""So Friday night and early Saturday will be our focus for the greatest impact in northern Arizona,"" he continued. ""Keep in mind, these two storms.""
​But that's not all.
​Another storm will hit on Monday. However, Klimowski says, Monday's storm might come in earlier, as soon as late Sunday or even Sunday night.
​Monday's storm will also bring heavy snow to northern Arizona with lower snow levels, possibly down about 4,500 feet or so, said Klimowski. The NWS is keeping an eye on that one.
​""We're not going to be out of the woods until Tuesday,"" he said. ""So be prepared.""
​For Flagstaff, the latest NWS map shows snowfall accumulation at 12 to 18 inches.
​""For much of Mogollon Rim, it's going to be all snow,"" Klimowski said. ""The first peak will be (this evening), probably before midnight.""
​The high country is not going to see much of a break with a continuation of light snow and snow showers, and tailing off a bit. But it will really ramp up Saturday night and into Saturday morning.
​""This is going to be a very intense time of snowfall and winds gusting to about 30 mph for Flagstaff and Forest Lake, Arizona,"" Klimowski said. ""Mogollon Rim is going to be impacted severely on Friday night and on Saturday morning.""
​Klimowski says people should be prepared for these kinds of conditions, saying people should certainly anticipate significant and dangerous travel overnight on Friday and into Saturday.
​""It's going to sweep through with a lot of wind,"" Klimowski said. ""Snow levels will lower to about 5,500 feet.""
​Coconino County announced yesterday that the county's emergency management is working with public works, law enforcement agencies, the Arizona Department of Transportation, utility companies, among other entities to ensure a coordinated response for any adverse impact the storm may have on residents.
​The American Red Cross also announced that chapters across Arizona are preparing for the series of storms by rallying volunteers and keeping in touch with local emergency management offices.
​In Show Low, Arizona, residents will see peaks a bit later with the first peak of snow ramping up this evening and tonight, and hail on Friday. Residents will seek another peak late Friday night and into Saturday morning.
​For the northeast part of Arizona – Black Mesa, Chuska Mountains, and Window Rock – residents will see less snow.
​""They're largely shadowed by the Mogollon Rim,"" Klimowski said. ""The trajectory of this storm in the northeast to the southeast largely keep them out of the heaviest snow area.""
​In the fullness of time, Diné in Western Navajo will see a lot of muddy roads at or above the snow level, he added.
​Coconino County District 5 Supervisor Lena Fowler said people in her district – Coppermine, Fredonia, Jacob Lake, Kaibeto, LeChee, Little Colorado River, Marble Canyon, Naatsis'áán, North Rim, Page, Ts'ahbiikin, and Tónaneesdizí – need to be very careful during travel and need to be prepared for this triple threat storm.
​""Check on your families and see if they need firewood,"" Fowler urged. ""And put together a supply kit.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154739463996233/?type=3,2017-01-19 23:41:16,307,18,73,272,9,21,1,3,1

WINDOW ROCK -- Two winter storms are on their way to Arizona and will bring snow to the northern part of the state as well as western New Mexico, according to the National Weather Service.

The first storm is expected to arrive in eastern Arizona on Thursday and will bring snow to levels higher than 5,000 feet in elevation.

The second storm will arrive Friday afternoon and last until Sunday morning, bringing heavy snowfall and high winds (30 mph) from the west. Snow is expected to fall around 5,000 feet and around 4,000-4,500 feet on Sunday.

Another storm is expected to hit on Monday, Jan. 23 with snow around 4,000-4,500 feet.

The Navajo Nation is expected to get heavy snowfall and hazardous road conditions. 

Snow is expected to fall along the Grand Canyon, Chuska Mountains and the Gallup, New Mexico area all the way down to The Gila National Forrest.

The greatest impact of the storms will be along the Mogollon Rim, the higher terrain of Yavapai County and the higher terrain of Northern Arizona, according to the NWS.

Plan for delays and consider alternate routes on January 4.
 
With the new year comes phase one of a new bridge over the Ganado Wash on State Route 264 in northeastern Arizona.  The Arizona Department of Transportation is scheduled to set 12 bridge girders on Wednesday, Jan. 4, requiring a series of highway closures that will impact drivers in both directions.
 
East- and westbound SR 264 will be closed in 30-minute increments at milepost 446 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. while work is underway. Milepost 446 is a half mile west of the intersection of SR 264 and US 191 South in Ganado.
 
Drivers should plan for delays of at least 30 minutes.  Access will be permitted only for emergency responders when feasible.  After each bridge girder is set and braced, traffic will be allowed through the work area.   
 
The work is part of a $24 million highway safety improvement project on SR 264 from the community of Burnside to Ganado on the Navajo Nation. In addition to replacing the bridge, ADOT is paving and widening the roadway; replacing or installing guardrail and signage; and completing other roadway and safety improvements.  The project began in  August 2016 and is scheduled for completion in October 2017.

By Arlyssa Becenti
Navajo Times

WINDOW ROCK - Navajo Nation Vice President spent the Friday before Christmas surprising business patrons at Lowes grocery store and a laundromat in Window Rock.

Lance Sam was helping his wife with the laundry when Nez walked in. Sam was, holding his 2-month-old daughter, and looked surprised when the Vice President walked trough the doors and handed his 3-year-old son, Isiah, a Captain America figurine. Nez shook Sam's hand and gave him a goody bag as well. 

""My wife knew who he was,"" said Sam about Nez. ""She's all 'that's the Vice President' and she got all happy. He's making people feel happy.""

This was just the second stop for Nez, before he was at Lowes Supermarket giving out goody bags to unsuspecting shoppers. 

""It's Christmas. It's time to spread joy, cheer and hope,"" said Nez. ""Just to be apart of something bigger, which is giving and seeing the children and the people with a smile on their face during Christmas."" 

Nez said at the end of the day he would also give out goody bags to Navajo Nation employees. 

During Thanksgiving, Nez made stops at various grocery stores in Gallup, Window Rock, and other parts of the Navajo Nation and handed out turkeys to elderly shoppers.",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10154653821686233/?type=3,2016-12-23 19:01:44,1306,96,121,1073,204,27,2,0,0

By Donovan Quintero
Navajo Times

WINDOW ROCK — Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault III said he received word Sunday afternoon from the Army Corps of Engineers that permits for the Dakota Access Pipeline to be constructed under Lake Oahe were denied. 

In a press release, the Chairman said he wholeheartedly supports their decision. 

""Instead, the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to a possible alternative routes,"" Archambault said.

The announcement came as hundreds of U.S. military veterans were on their way to the protest camp site where thousands of people have gathered in protest of the pipeline project. 

Air Force and Marine Corps veteran TyAnn Nakai, who traveled to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation with 30 other veterans, wrote on her Facebook page of the news.

""Lililili! Got the news That Dakota Access Pipeline project will stop!!"" Nakai wrote.

Videos on social media show thousands of Dakota Access Pipeline protesters celebrating the Army Corps' decision. 

Archambault said the Corps' denial was a victory for his tribe, but he hopes CEO of Energy Transfer Partners Kelcy Warren, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple and President-elect Donald Trump will respect the decision.

""When it comes to infrastructure  development in Indian Country and with respect to treaty lands, we must strive to work together,"" the Standing Rock Sioux Chairman said. ""Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward.""

Archambault also reached out to the law enforcement of the area and said he hoped they can all work together to heal their relationships.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154584893651233/?type=3,2016-12-04 18:29:18,6883,159,1897,5699,1116,56,8,3,1

Police at the scene said there had been ""some"" arrests while the group of about 15 protesters put the number at two. The protest was still active as of 4:45 p.m.

The protesters are urging people to close their Wells Fargo accounts because of the bank's investment in the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Police and protesters both said some of the protesters entered the bank to try to discourage patrons, after which the bank called police to remove them from the premises. At 4:45 p.m. six Navajo Nation police vehicles and a sheriff's vehicle were parked outside the bank and the protest was peaceful.

Protesters used megaphones to urge Wells Fargo patrons to close their accounts.

Most of the customers walked past the protesters and ignored them.

PRESIDENT BEGAYE AND VICE PRESIDENT NEZ MOURN THE PASSING OF NAVAJO CODE TALKER GEORGE PAUL JAMES

WINDOW ROCK, ARIZ -- President Russell Begaye and Vice President Jonathan Nez were saddened today to learn of the passing of Navajo Code Talker George Paul James. 

Code Talker James passed away on the morning of Wednesday, November 9, at 6:51 a.m., at Lovelace Hospital in Albuquerque, NM. 

""With the passing of Navajo Code Talker George Paul James, we are witnessing the tragic loss of a historical icon to the Navajo people and the citizens of the United States.  James was selfless in his service to our country and to the Navajo Nation.  He defended our great land as a Code Talker by using the Navajo language to encode military messages and ultimately contributed to protecting our freedom.  For this, we are forever grateful,"" President Begaye said.

James was Tótsohnii (Big Water Clan) born for Ma'ii deeshgiizhinii (Coyote Pass Clan).

He graduated high school from Chilocco Indian School in Newkirk, OK.  He enlisted into the Marine Corps at 17 years of age and went to boot camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, CA.  He reached the rank of Corporal in the 5th Marine Division.

Corporal James saw action the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II.  He later returned to Iwo Jima for the 60th Anniversary of the raising of the flag on Mt. Suribachi.  James' grandchildren said their grandfather spoke to them later in life about his experiences and that he kept everything clear in his memory.

""Many of our Navajo Code Talkers came back from their service having been told that they could not talk about their experiences.  Many of them suffered nightmares, flashbacks and post-traumatic stress disorder from what they had seen,"" Vice President Nez said. ""Yet their service as Navajo Code Talkers is what has ensured our freedom beyond any artillery or weaponry.  OPVP salutes Code Talker James for his sacrifice in protecting the Navajo Nation and the U.S.""

Navajo Code Talker George Paul James is preceded in death by his wife Mary James, his son Alva Kirk James, his daughter Linda James, and his grandson Derrick Lewis. He is survived by his sons George James Jr., Melvin James, and Gerald James and also by his daughters Shirley Barry, Loretta Danzuka, Ernestine James, and Lynnann Charley.",,status,,2016-11-09 19:48:31,679,60,167,333,62,1,1,281,1

By Cindy Yurth

Tséyi' Bureau

WINDOW ROCK — Donald Trump Jr., eldest child of Republican presidential contender Donald Trump, will visit the Shiprock Chapter House Friday after speaking in Farmington, a San Juan County Republican Party spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.

The time is not certain, but the spokeswoman said Trump would depart for Shiprock immediately following his speech and meeting with supporters at the Piñon Hills Community Church, 5101 N. Dustin Ave. in Farmington. That speech is set for 2 p.m.

""They're saying 3 o'clock in Shiprock, but I'm thinking it will be closer to 4,"" the spokeswoman said.

Trump's campaign has reached out to Native Americans recently, including a conference call with Native leaders last Thursday (see story on Page A-11) and, on Sunday, announcing a Native American coalition chaired by U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla., Cherokee), with Navajo Code Talker Fleming Begaye Sr. as honorary chairman.

New Mexico State Rep. Sharon Clahchischilliage (R-Dist. 4) was also named to the coalition. In a press release, Clahchischilliage was quoted as saying she was ""outraged"" that ""Indian County is prevented from harnessing our own energy resources by ever-increasing regulations,"" and she supports Trump's stance on easing regulations.

He said the Navajo Nation has ""had many friends and champions from both the Democratic and Republican parties.""

""In my view, our tribal issues do not fit nicely into one political party,"" he said. ""Each of the two major parties offer some policies and proposals that can benefit the Navajo people and it is important to work with both of these groups to advance our nation.""

Before the actual endorsement, he stated why he would not be supporting the Republican nominee Donald Trump, who he said would not support Navajo Nation sovereignty and has attacked Indian gaming. 

""Mr. Trump has funded advertising campaigns that falsely accused Indian gaming of being involved in organized crime and drugs,"" Begaye said. ""He has also supported using the power of the federal government to deny tribal sovereignty. I have serious concerns about whether Mr. Trump would honor our inherent tribal sovereignty and respect our treaty with the United States."" 

He added that he could not support a candidate who ""denigrates and belittles women as Mr. Trump's actions have shown.""

He then listed reasons for his endorsement of Clinton including that he saw her as a strong partner in government-to-government relations. 

""In this campaign, she has committed to serving tribal nations through strengthening public safety, combating drugs and alcohol, advocating for access to high quality education, improving Indian health care, and fighting for our Native American veterans,"" Begaye said. ""As a Senator, she continued this effort by cosponsoring legislation to improve Indian health care and tribal colleges. I trust she will respect our treaty and I look forward to working with her administration on a government-to-government basis.""

Finally, he gave a direct endorsement of Clinton and encouraged the Navajo Nation and other Indian nations to do the same. 

""I wholeheartedly endorse Hillary Clinton for the office of President of the United States. I encourage the electorate of the great Navajo Nation to review both candidates' records and join me in this support.

Oct. 27, 2016
PRESS RELEASE:

NAJA calls for ethical reporting on Cleveland baseball team

NORMAN, Okla. – The Major League Baseball World Series is underway, and we congratulate the teams from Cleveland and Chicago for their performance and the example they have set for their peers. Yet there is still another example to be set.

The Native American Journalists Association calls on media professionals and others in the sports industry to eliminate the use of Native American-themed mascots and imagery.

We believe that the Cleveland team's ""Chief Wahoo"" logo, in conjunction with its name, perpetuates a stereotype based on the race and ethnic identity of Native people. It is dehumanizing imagery that leads to dehumanizing actions against Native people, and its continued use by mainstream and sports media is wholly unethical.

NAJA adheres to the ethical code prescribed by the Society of Professional Journalists, and urges journalists to exercise careful consideration before publishing racist and derogatory imagery.

Avoid stereotyping. Journalists should examine the ways their values and experiences may shape their reporting.

Show compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage. Use heightened sensitivity when dealing with juveniles, victims of sex crimes, and sources or subjects who are inexperienced or unable to give consent. Consider cultural differences in approach and treatment. (emphasis added)

Consider the long-term implications of the extended reach and permanence of publication. Provide updated and more complete information as appropriate.

The American Psychological Association has called for the permanent discontinuance of Native American mascots based on a growing body of scientific research. The conclusion was that American Indian mascots, symbols and imagery have negative effects on Native and non-Native students by presenting stereotypical images of Native Americans, undermining the ability of tribal citizens to portray accurate and respectful images of their culture, and serve as a form of discrimination that can lead to negative relations between groups.

Baseball is said to be ""America's pastime,"" and has often served as an inflection point on forces at play in greater society including race relations. In fact, Native American baseball players have been instrumental in the history of racial integration of baseball. From the first Native player, Louis Sockalexis (Penobscot), who debuted in the Spring of 1897, to modern day stars Jacoby Ellsbury (Navajo) and Joba Chamberlain (Winnebago), Native players have been an important part of the fabric of our nation's baseball tradition.

It's unfortunate that the Cleveland team has not found a way to honor these contributions to the sport, but instead have employed and propagated derogatory imagery that is demeaning and harmful.

It is our recommendation that sports journalists and media organizations adopt a culturally sensitive policy that refers to the Cleveland MLB team by the city name and league only and eliminates the use of the ""Chief Wahoo"" logo. This policy satisfies the ethical requirement for accuracy while omitting the harmful and stereotypical imagery.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154468953966233/?type=3,2016-10-26 14:18:37,69,13,23,67,0,2,0,0,0

""That is my formal Navajo introduction,"" the statement said. ""Yes, despite the U.S. government's best attempts, it is how we Navajo, Diné people still introduce ourselves at formal events such as this.""

 The Oxford Union has hosted world leaders in virtually every field, including, Albert Einstein, Sir Winston Churchill, former US Presidents Reagan, Nixon, and Carter, Malcolm X, Mother Teresa, and the Dalai Lama to name a few. President Begaye will be the first Native American leader to address this group.

President Begaye plans to speak about the Navajo and other Indian Nations, their relationship with the U.S. government, and the need to recognize and practice true Native sovereignty.

According to the statement, viewers will see a personal side of the Navajo Nation president.

""It's interesting to be in England, the birthplace of the English language,"" the bullet-pointed remarks said. ""You see, I didn't learn English until I went away from my family to boarding school. No, this boarding school was not a place of privilege such as Oxford – my boarding school was a place that often included physical pain and suffering.""

The Oxford Union often focuses on international political discourse. Much of this discourse is led by U.S. actions, such as actions in Russia, Cuba, or the Middle East. However, there is little discussion about U.S. actions and policy towards its own Native American people. President Begaye will focus on this relationship and the need to bring this relationship into the 21st century by acknowledging true Native nation sovereignty.

The speech will take place on October 25th, and will be available on the Oxford Union Youtube channel which has 29 million views in this past year.",,status,,2016-10-25 17:09:55,262,18,77,248,6,8,0,0,0

HEINRICH TOURS RAYTHEON DINÉ FACILITY, HIGHLIGHTS EXPANSION AND NEW JOBS

FARMINGTON -- Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) toured the Raytheon Missile Systems Diné Facility south of Farmington. The facility is nearing completion of a new warehouse that will enable Raytheon to streamline the flow of material and production and hire more employees.

During his visit to the 27-year-old plant, Senator Heinrich met with Raytheon Site Manager Matt Ryan and other employees to thank them for their contributions to national security and discuss the construction of the $3.6 million, 30,000 square foot warehouse on the Navajo Nation. There are currently 330 employees--the majority of whom are tribal members--who work at the facility, which is more than double from two years ago. Raytheon has plans to hire an additional 30 workers.

""As a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, ensuring that our military has the tools and resources it needs to keep our nation safe, fight terrorism, and support our allies, is a top priority for me. I am immensely proud of the workers at Raytheon's Diné facility who are manufacturing the systems that our military uses to keep us safe. The expansion of this facility on the Navajo Nation is testament to the quality work its employees currently do every day,"" said Sen. Heinrich.

Senator Heinrich continues to look for new manufacturing opportunities for New Mexico. Three years ago, Senator Heinrich recognized a tremendous opportunity that could benefit our national security interests, while increasing jobs in our state. At the time, the United States had generously provided over $1 billion to Israel for its Iron Dome missile defense system, which had a success rate of more than 85 percent and saved lives. Despite this significant amount of foreign assistance, none of the manufacturing of the Iron Dome system occurred in the United States. Therefore, Senator Heinrich successfullyamended legislation to require and authorize $15 million to start co-manufacturing the Iron Dome short-range rocket system in the United States.

""I will continue to look for opportunities that will help strengthen our military and increase the manufacturing presence in New Mexico,"" said Sen. Heinrich.",,status,,2016-10-24 14:05:51,60,13,12,54,0,2,0,4,0

PRESIDENT BEGAYE TESTIFIES AT SENATE HEARING ON IMPROVING CULTURAL PROTECTION LAWS

ALBUQUERQUE—President Russell Begaye called on lawmakers and administration officials to improve upon cultural resource protection laws. He testified at a U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs oversight field hearing on the ""Theft, Illegal Possession, Sale, Transfer and Export of Tribal Cultural Items"" at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center.

President Begaye requested Congress and the federal government to join together diplomatically and through passage of legislation to ""enhance protection and repatriation of our human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony. These laws must have timelines, unambiguous definitions, defined roles and responsibilities and teeth to enforce their compliance.""

The field hearing is important as several measures to address these issues have been drafted and are circulating in both the House and Senate. The Senate passed the PROTECT Patrimony Resolution, H. Con. Res. 122. When the House reconvenes following the general election the Navajo Nation expects the House to take action on the Senate amended concurrent resolution. This will demonstrate a powerful message by the Congress that they are serious about protecting Native American cultural patrimony.

Additionally, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) introduced S 3127, the Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act. The bill would prohibit the exporting of sacred Native American items and increase penalties for stealing and illegally trafficking tribal cultural patrimony. Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) have signed on as cosponsors of the bill. Earlier this year in June, the Navajo Nation Council passed a resolution supporting the bill.

""By passing these cultural protection laws, Congress will take another step in making history in its endeavor to make the Navajo Nation and all tribes across the country whole after experiencing the erosion of their cultural identities. You will contribute to our hózhó, the beauty way of our life,"" said President Begaye.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154444370041233/?type=3,2016-10-18 18:04:53,229,14,65,209,13,7,0,0,0

OPVP MOURNS PASSING OF NAVAJO CODE TALKER DAN AKEE

Tuba City, Ariz -- The Navajo Nation lost a great treasure in the passing of Navajo Code Talker Dan Akee, Sr., on Friday, Oct. 14, at 9:50 a.m.

""Dan Akee was not just a Navajo Nation treasure. He was an international treasure and icon whose service will stand as a testament to the freedom of all Americans,"" said President Begaye.

Sergeant Major Akee was 96 years old when he passed on.  According to Akee's son, Dan Akee Jr., his father was born just north of the Coalmine Chapter house on Nov. 11, 1919.

In 1944, Akee joined the Armed Forces when he heard they were recruiting Navajos.  He became a member of the Code Talker team attached to the 4th Marine Division of the 25th Regiment. He took part in conflicts on four Pacific islands, and most notably Iwo Jima.

Akee's son told that his father was the Battle of Iwo Jima when six Marines, including Gila River Indian Community member Ira Hayes, raised the U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi.

President Begaye and Vice President Nez established a great relationship with Dan Akee, Sr., when they assisted in renovating his house this past February.  Akee had said it was his dream to move back into the house he built. 

""We gutted the bathroom, removed the appliances, replaced windows and window frames and tore down walls,"" President Begaye said. ""With the help of local volunteer groups, Red Feather Development and the Tuba City Veterans Office, we were able to renovate his home from top to bottom."" 

The president said it was an honor to assist the code talker.  He also note that Code Talker Akee rode with OPVP during this year's Navajo Nation and Northern Navajo Nation fair parades. 

Akee Jr., who is Board Member of Code Talkers Association, said that he and his siblings would like to thank their father for his service to the United States. 

""My father always told us to be proud of speaking the Navajo language,"" he said. ""Always be careful of the words you speak as they are sacred, he would warn us,"" 

Vice President Jonathan Nez said he was saddened to learn about the passing of Dan Akee, Sr., but commended his service to the Marines as a Navajo Code Talker.  

""Our Navajo Code Talkers including Dan Akee, defended the United States against the interception of critical information and strategies by encoding messages into the Navajo Language.  This code was never broken and is a great part of the proud history of our people,"" he said. 

""He helped to move the nation forward and as such, we grieve the loss of our Navajo Code Talker,"" President Begaye said. ""We send our deepest condolences to his family and we will order all flags to be flown at half-staff on the day of his funeral.""

At this time, the Office of the President and Vice President is calling upon the Navajo people to keep the Akee family in their prayers.  OPVP also sends condolences to the family.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154430217416233/?type=3,2016-10-14 16:59:50,3696,203,1272,2357,423,4,3,908,1

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

TÓNANEESDIZÍ, Ariz. – Navajo Code Talker Dan Akee died on Thursday in Tuba City, Arizona. He would have turned 95 on Veterans Day. 
 
For his birthday last year, Akee received his wish of a renovated home thanks to a number of partners, including the Navajo-Hopi Honor Riders, the Navajo Nation Office of the President and Vice President, Red Feather Development, and the Western Agency Department of Navajo Veteran Affairs; and the 125 volunteers who took the time to restore the four-bed home. 
 
The four-month project, called ""Going Home,"" was completed this year in February. 
 
Akee served with the 4th Marine Division from 1939 to 1945 at Iwo Jima, the Marshall Islands, Pacific Theater, and the Northern Mariana Islands – Saipan and Tinian. 
 
Akee told the Navajo Times in an interview last year that he heard that the Armed Forces were recruiting Diné, so he volunteered but did not pass the physical. He volunteered again later and passed, becoming a member of the code talker team of the 25th Marine Regiment. 
 
Akee served until he started to show the psychological effects of prolonged exposure to combat. 
 
""You'd rather die or live,"" the Marine said last year. ""I'm not afraid to die.""
 
His son, Danny Akee said in the Navajo tradition, one does not say that. But in the military way, Akee ""has the right to say whatever he wants. He earned it."" 
 
He was Kiyaa'áanii and born for 'Áshįįhíí.

By Bill Donovan
Special to the Times

GALLUP --  A Nageezi, New Mexico, man has been sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison for his involvement in attacking another man with an ax.
    
Henderson Castillo, 27, was sentenced in federal court in Albuquerque on federal assault charges.
    
According to the complaint, Castillo got into an argument with another Navajo man, who was not identified, on Dec. 4, 2015 at the Red Mesa Store in Torreon.  During the fight, the victim had been kicked several times in the face and struck with an ax during an altercation with Castillo and Orlando King, Castillo's brother.
    
The victim later told federal agents that he had gone to store to get snacks before going home when Castillo and King walked up to him.
    
He said Castillo asked him, ""Why did you hit my dad?"" to which the victim responded by claiming it was because Castillo was shooting at the victim's sister, an incident that was at the time being adjudicated in tribal court. 
    
Castillo and King then attacked the man, according to the complaint, hitting him in the face and pushing him to the ground after which Castillo went to the bed of the victim's truck and came back with an ax.
    
The complaint said Castillo then swung the ax at the victim trying to hit him with the sharp part. The victim said he kept rolling around to avoid being hit. He managed to avoid the ax four or five times, causing it to hit the ground near him.
    
Castillo then turned the ax around and began striking at him with the blunt side up, hitting him in the left arm and in the back.
    
One of the employees of the store, identified as KJ, came out, saw what was happening and joined other bystanders in yelling at the two to stop. She said she saw King and told him, ""Get in the truck and leave. We called the cops.""
    
Before they left, witnesses said they saw the two kick the victim in the face several more times.
    
KJ said when the two left,she saw the man on the ground screaming in pain.
    
""A bone was sticking out from his left elbow,"" she said. ""It was white and there were bubbles coming out around it.""
    
The victim sustained an open fracture to his left humerus, a bone between his elbow and shoulder. He was airlifted to the University of New Mexico hospital where he had surgery.
    
Castillo pleaded guilty to the assault on June 24. Besides the prison sentence, Castillo will be on supervised probation for a year after his sentence  is completed.
    
As for King, he pleaded guilty to assault back in March and was placed on probation for three years,
    
One of the conditions of his probation, however, was that he refrain from taking drugs and on Aug. 25, he was back in federal court for violating his probation.
    
According to his probation report, he submitted urine samples on June 20 and June 30 that came back positive for amphetamines.
    
Then, on July 16, he was arrested by state police who were at the Torreon store, recognized him and saw that he had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech. They also found an open container of an alcoholic beverage in his truck. 
    
After admitting that he had been driving the vehicle, he was given field sobriety tests which he failed and then blew a .16 and a .18 on his breath alcohol test. State police also noticed that he had children in his vehicle and they were not secured by child restrain seats.
    
He is now in the Bernalillo District Court facing charges of abuse of a child, aggravated DWI and having an open liquor container in his vehicle. No trial date has been set.
    
He was then arrested by federal agents on Aug. 25 for his failed drug tests and failing to abide by a condition of his probation not to get arrested by local or state authorities.
    
He is waiting for a trial date on that matter.",,status,,2016-10-14 10:26:09,66,27,30,40,0,15,4,2,5

The New Mexico Public Education Department partnered with New Mexico First, a public policy organization that facilitates public town halls and forums in the state, to establish the consultations before the Every Student Succeeds Act goes into effect between 2017 and 2018.
When it replaces NCLB over that time, ESSA is to become the primary law governing K-12 education in the United States.
Passed in 2015, the law maintains previous mandates that states, school districts and individual schools establish standards that allow comparison between and among schools. Under the new law, states have greater autonomy to set goals within a federal framework. The federal framework from NCLB granted less autonomy under a more rigid system.
By summer of 2017, all states must submit an implementation plan for ESSA to the U.S. Department of Education. To facilitate community involvement in the process, PED and First will host ""NM Rising: Engaging Our Communities for Excellence in Education"" sessions in Farmington on Oct. 14, in Santa Fe on Oct. 17, in Albuquerque on Oct. 18, in Roswell on Oct. 27, and in Las Cruces on Nov. 15.

That same day, according to a memo Begaye sent to Bates, the President also signed 17 line-item vetoes on the 2017 Navajo Nation Comprehensive Budget the Council had approved.",Council fights back on budget - Navajo Times,link,http://navajotimes.com/rezpolitics/council-fights-back-budget/,2016-10-03 18:55:03,165,38,48,141,0,17,1,4,2

Navajo Times to cease delivery to Phoenix, San Carlos areas

By Navajo Times

WINDOW ROCK -- The Navajo Times Publishing Company, Inc. has announced that beginning Friday, Sept. 16, there will no longer be delivery of the Navajo Times printed issue to the Phoenix and San Carlos areas.

These two separate delivery routes include multiple sales outlets  in several towns along the way to Phoenix and San Carlos.
The newspaper route to Phoenix includes sales outlets located in Heber, Payson, Fort McDowell, Scottsdale, Chandler, and central Phoenix.

The San Carlos route has sales outlets established in St. Johns, Snowflake, Show Low, Pinetop, Hondah, Cibeque, Peridot, Bylas, and San Carlos.

Tom Arviso Jr., publisher of the Navajo Times, said the decision to stop delivery on these two routes was due to a decline in circulation sales.

""It was strictly a business decision. We've been losing money on these two routes for about the last year and although we've tried different things to stimulate better sales, it just didn't work,"" said Arviso. ""When you run a business, you have to balance your expenses with your revenue so that hopefully at the end of the day, you are able to generate at least a small profit.

""But with these two delivery routes, we were just not covering our expenses from week to week. So, we had to make a hard business decision and that resulted in deciding to terminate these routes.""

Arviso explained that the Navajo Times would be delivered as usual to Phoenix and San Carlos on Sept. 8 and Sept. 15 but thereafter, it would cease.","Navajo Times to cease delivery to Phoenix, San Carlos areas - Navajo Times",link,http://navajotimes.com/biz/navajo-times-cease-delivery-phoenix-san-carlos-areas/,2016-09-29 14:38:11,214,38,41,156,1,15,3,37,2

By Arlyssa Becenti

WINDOW ROCK -- Twenty-two legislative district assistants will be out of work after Friday — the last day of the present fiscal year — thanks to a line-item vetoed by President Russell Begaye in the Fiscal Year 2017 budget.

Begaye also vetoed funds needed to prevent layoffs within the regional business development office, shore up the Navajo Area Agency on Aging, establish an Amber Alert system and hire more criminal investigators, all of which were added to the budget by council in recent deliberations. In total, there is seventeen items in which Begaye exercised his line item vetoes.

With the vetoes, Begaye signed FY 2017's $659.7 million comprehensive budget. And even with an increase of almost $40 million from the present year's budget, it doesn't prevent layoffs.

Carolene Whiteman, Legislative District Assistant to Council Delegate Edmund Yazzie (Churchrock/Iyanbito/Mariano Lake/Pinedale/Smith Lake/Thoreau) for the past three years, said she was ""devastated"" that her last day on the job will be on Friday after Begaye vetoed $1.6 million that would have gone to pay the assistants.",Legislative aides could be out of work Friday - Navajo Times,link,http://navajotimes.com/reznews/legislative-aides-work-friday/,2016-09-29 10:38:10,120,31,27,98,1,11,6,1,3

WINDOW ROCK — The family of a man missing for nearly five months is seeking the help of Navajo Times readers.
Frank ""Frankie"" F. Martin Jr. was last seen at Midtown Market in Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico (about seven miles from Taos), at 5:17 a.m. on April 19.
The previous day at about 11 a.m., he had called his mother, who was sick, to ask how she was.
It was a normal conversation between family members, his mother, Louise Benally, recalled.
""He asked me how I was and I said, 'O.K.,'"" she remembered. ""He asked me what I was doing and I said, 'Cooking some food.' He didn't sound stressed. He sounded normal.""
That was the last anyone heard from Martin. His live-in ex-girlfriend called the family April 19 to say he had not come home and she had reported him missing.
Martin is described as five-foot-seven, about 140 pounds, with brown eyes, shoulder-length black hair, and a goatee. He has a tattoo of a teardrop under his right eye and possibly a cross on the side of one hand. In a surveillance video the family obtained from Midtown Market, he's wearing a grey hoodie and a black cap.
Martin's sister, Jolene Benally, said the local sheriff's department in Taos was investigating the case but had not turned up any leads.
""The family has been doing our own investigation,"" she said.
Anyone who has information on Martin is asked to call Tammie Benally, 505-340-1894 or Rhoda Benally, 701-690-3336, or Crime Stoppers at 575-758-4258.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154336914691233/?type=3,2016-09-12 12:02:15,499,72,911,361,2,11,0,124,1

JOINT STATEMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR REGARDING STANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE V. U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS:

Following today's ruling in Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps, the Army announced that it will not authorize construction on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe until it determines whether it will need to reconsider any of its previous decisions regarding the Lake Oahe site. Federal agencies are asking the Dakota Access pipeline company to voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahe.

Federal agencies are inviting all tribes to formal, government-to-government consultations in the fall to address how the federal government can better ensure meaningful tribal input into infrastructure-related reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights. The agencies also will explore with tribes whether new legislation should be proposed to Congress to alter the current statutory framework to promote those goals.

See below a joint statement by the Department of the Army, the Department of Justice, and the Department of the Interior.

Date: Friday, September 9, 2016�

WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice, the Department of the Army and the Department of the Interior issued the following statement regarding Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers:

""We appreciate the District Court's opinion on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act. However, important issues raised by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other tribal nations and their members regarding the Dakota Access pipeline specifically, and pipeline-related decision-making generally, remain. Therefore, the Department of the Army, the Department of Justice, and the Department of the Interior will take the following steps.

""The Army will not authorize constructing the Dakota Access pipeline on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe until it can determine whether it will need to reconsider any of its previous decisions regarding the Lake Oahe site under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) or other federal laws. Therefore, construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe will not go forward at this time. The Army will move expeditiously to make this determination, as everyone involved — including the pipeline company and its workers — deserves a clear and timely resolution. In the interim, we request that the pipeline company voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahe.

""Furthermore, this case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes' views on these types of infrastructure projects. Therefore, this fall, we will invite tribes to formal, government-to-government consultations on two questions: (1) within the existing statutory framework, what should the federal government do to better ensure meaningful tribal input into infrastructure-related reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights; and (2) should new legislation be proposed to Congress to alter that statutory framework and promote those goals.

""Finally, we fully support the rights of all Americans to assemble and speak freely. We urge everyone involved in protest or pipeline activities to adhere to the principles of nonviolence. Of course, anyone who commits violent or destructive acts may face criminal sanctions from federal, tribal, state, or local authorities. The Departments of Justice and the Interior will continue to deploy resources to North Dakota to help state, local, and tribal authorities, and the communities they serve, better communicate, defuse tensions, support peaceful protest, and maintain public safety. 

""In recent days, we have seen thousands of demonstrators come together peacefully, with support from scores of sovereign tribal governments, to exercise their First Amendment rights and to voice heartfelt concerns about the environment and historic, sacred sites. It is now incumbent on all of us to develop a path forward that serves the broadest public interest.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154328774141233/?type=3,2016-09-09 15:36:00,982,58,737,864,69,13,0,2,34

By Terry Bowman
Navajo Times

WINDOW ROCK— A federal district court judge said on Wednesday afternoon he will not make a decision until September regarding the lawsuit by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against the Army Corps of Engineers for granting permits to Dakota Access, LLC.

Federal Judge James E. Boasberge said the ruling is to be rendered on Sept. 9. and Sept. 14 is set as a date for an appeal by either side. The Standing Rock Sioux filed a lawsuit against the federal regulators to halt construction of the pipeline earlier this month.

Since no decision has been reached as of Wednesday afternoon, construction for the pipeline can continue in the meantime until a decision has been reached in September.

The Dakota Access Pipeline is a $3.78 billion, 1,172-mile project that could carry half-million barrels of crude oil to Patoka, Illinois, speading over the Missouri River. The river is the main drinking and irrigation water supply for the Standing Rock Sioux and other Native Tribes.

In a letter addressed to Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault II late Monday, Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye and VP Jonathan Nez voiced their support of the Standing Rock Sioux's opposition of the pipeline and its manufacturer, Texas' based company Energy Transfer Partners.

Native activists and protesters are gathered at the Hunkpapa Territory near Cannon Ball, ND to protest the pipeline.",,status,,2016-08-24 18:33:49,358,27,139,244,3,11,1,18,81

PRESIDENT BEGAYE AND VICE PRESIDENT NEZ STAND IN SUPPORT OF STANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE OPPOSING THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE

WINDOW ROCK-Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye and Vice President Jonathan Nez issued a letter today supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in their opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline.  

The Standing Rock Sioux have been fighting the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, which is proposed to be built under the Missouri River on Treaty lands a half-mile from their reservation. According to the Standing Rock Sioux, their water supply is being threatened by the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline.  

""We stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe as they defend the encroachment of potential environmental disasters along their traditional border,"" President Begaye said.

Native American tribes are constantly fighting to protect the sanctity of their natural resources and tribal territories.  

Often this includes opposing the development of natural resource industries or construction developments that are proposed near or adjacent to sacred tribal lands.  It also includes protecting the purity of water sources and opposing the mining of caustic or radioactive elements.

""Time and again, Native American tribes have faced encroaching development upon tribal lands from industry and the federal government. Industrial interests have damaged Indian lands and left tribes with the legacy of cleaning up,"" Vice President Nez said. ""From uranium mining to the recent Gold King Mine spill and Dakota Access Pipeline, these issues continue.""

In this day and age, the need for tribes to band together is critical in uniting against outside interests. It shows the government and corporations that Native Americans are serious when it comes to defending their lands and resources.

""In defending their traditional homeland against development that could potentially harm their lands and the purity of their natural resources, the Navajo Nation stands in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe,"" President Begaye said.

The letter, which is addressed to Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II, pledges water and other necessities to assist those who are present in the formal resistance and opposition of the Dakota Access Pipeline.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154276096921233/?type=3,2016-08-23 21:44:41,5431,182,4777,4685,691,45,2,3,5

The Shiprock Chapter early Saturday morning declared a state of emergency after floodwaters displaced 27 people and washed away entire homes, farms and livestock.

The flood occurred in the Salt Wash area, about four miles northwest of Shiprock. It began with heavy rains late Friday night, said Chapter President Duane ""Chili"" Yazzie. By midnight, about 30 residents had sought refuge at the chapter house, where they slept on cots.

Only minor injuries were reported, but at least two families lost everything they had, Yazzie said. 

""At least 10 families had to leave their homes because of the water,"" he said. ""They came with stories about rising water, standing in their homes with water at waist level, water rushing in with the sound of thunder.""

As Tsingine continues to walk toward Shipley when he draws his pistol. He fires his weapon at her.

WINSLOW - Like he did in the 1960s fighting for the rights of Native people, Shiprock Chapter President Duane ""Chili"" Yazzie walked in protest over the Easter Sunday shooting that led to death of Loreal Tsingine during confrontation with Winslow police officer Austin Shipley. 
Yazzie said the similarities between what he fought for then and now were not too different. 
""We've seen this too often, Yazzie said. ""We've experienced this in Farmington and, more recently, in Gallup.""
""We supposedly live in America that professes equality and justice for all,"" Yazzie continued. ""But we have a situation like this with Loreal (Tsingine) and the government and the powers that say that he didn't do anything wrong."" 
Yazzie walked near the back as protestors, organized by the Red Nation, carried picket signs that read Justice for Loreal"" and ""Shipley must go to jail."" 
The protest walk began from the Winslow City Hall and ended at the police department parking lot. 
The protest was held in response to Shipley's body cam that was made public on Wednesday, as well as Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery's decision to not charge the Winslow police officer for fatally shooting Tsingine on March 27 of this year. 
For Yazzie, the fatal shooting of a Native woman was something he said he's seen too many times since he began his advocacy for Native rights. 
""It's the same situation. It's really unfortunate that we have to demand justice when the evidence is so clear that there was a wrongdoing,"" he said. ""There's got to be accountability. That's what we demand here.""",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10154205965871233/?type=3,2016-07-30 00:04:02,1035,75,281,876,47,5,1,92,14

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery: No charges will be filed against Winslow police officer 

By Donovan Quintero
Navajo Times

WINSLOW - Winslow police officer Austin Shipley, who was involved in the Easter Sunday shooting death of Loreal Tsinigine, will not be charged in her death, according to Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery. 

""After careful review of the facts surrounding this case, including available video evidence and witness statements from all involved my office has found no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of officer Shipley,"" Montgomery said.

Winslow police received multiple calls from Circle K employees of a woman shoplifting and harassing store employees and threatening a store employee with scissors, the Maricopa County press release stated. 

Police officers responded to the scene, but the suspect had already left the store. Officers begin to search for her and Shipley located the suspect, the press release continued. Officer Shipley attempted to detain her, but she did not comply. While attempting to detain her, Shipley saw that she was holding scissors, which she swung at him. 

Shipley then retreated with his weapon drawn and gave multiple commands for the suspect to stop and drop her weapon, the statement continued. She did not comply and instead got up and aggressively advanced on the officer with scissors in hand. Officer Shipley discharged his weapon and the suspect was pronounced deceased at the scene. 

The City of Winslow simultaneously released a statement saying they would respect and abide the Maricopa County Attorney's and the Arizona Department of Public Safety's determinations, but would continue its own internal investigations into its police department, which is to be conducted by the Mesa Police Department.",,status,,2016-07-22 17:18:56,456,163,205,177,7,49,0,16,207

WINDOW ROCK — A three-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of dogs in Seba Dalkai Thursday, the boy's mother confirmed Monday.

Kimasha Begay of Gallup said her son, Kayden Colter Begay, was visiting his paternal grandparents, David and Sharon Begay, in Seba Dalkai and had followed his aunt out to get the cattle when a pack of 12 pit bulls owned by the family's neighbor, Marlinda Begay (a relation on Kayden's father's side) attacked him.

""From what I was told, the aunt didn't know Kayden had followed her,"" said Kimasha Begay, holding back sobs. ""She turned around and saw the dogs gathered around something. She went to see what they were doing, and that's when she found my son.""

Kimasha Begay said she was told the left side of Kayden's face had been torn off and his thigh was gnawed to the bone.

According to Kimasha Begay, people in the area had repeatedly complained to the Navajo Nation Rangers about the pack of dogs attacking livestock, but nothing was ever done.

""They weren't registered, they weren't vaccinated, and they were skin and bone,"" she said. ""They were probably hungry.""

Kimasha Begay said by the time she drove from Gallup to Seba Dalkai after she learned of her son's death, the police and Rangers were there.

""They destroyed some of the dogs, but I don't think they got all of them,"" she said.

A spokeswoman at the Navajo Nation Criminal Investigations Office in Dilkon confirmed that Criminal Investigations is investigating the incident. No charges have yet been filed.

The family has put up a GoFundMe page, ""Funeral Expense for Kayden Begay,"" to help defray funeral costs.

Kimasha Begay described her son as ""the happy kid who ran around shaking everyone's hand.""

""He loved to watch bullriding, and he loved to follow his nali around,"" Begay said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10154176999961233/?type=3,2016-07-18 14:06:16,8516,1705,4067,2339,49,63,7,5030,1028

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

KAIBAB NATIONAL FOREST – A lightning-caused fire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon increased to 13,685 acres on Monday, July 18, impacting at least seven Western Navajo communities, according to an update from fire officials.

With moderate fire growth, fire managers anticipate light smoke from fire activity today. And smoke may spread to the northeast, reaching the communities in Lake Powell Country and Kayenta.

Higher humidity throughout the day will reduce fire spread along most of the fire perimeter, according to fire officials.

The Fuller Fire started on June 29 and was allowed to burn for a week before suppression efforts started. The fire remains zero percent contained.

More than 500 firefighters, including the Navajo Hotshots and the Navajo Scouts, are battling the massive fire near Point Imperial here (Nát'oh Dziil in Diné bizaad), said Alan Sinclair, incident commander for the Southwest Area Incident Management Team 3.

""It grew a lot bigger than we expected,"" Sinclair said. ""In recorded history, (we) have never seen a fire like this in the North Rim.""

Dozens of Diné residents in northwestern Navajo beginning July 13 said the smoke from the fire has been affecting their health.

Vann Smith, superintendent of the Navajo Interagency Hotshot Crew, explained in Navajo that his crew is battling the blaze.

Winds yesterday, July 17, continued to spur natural fire growth to the north across the fire-adapted landscape. Increased cloud cover and higher humidity moderated fire behavior allowing for additional control work to the northeast and to the south, according to fire officials.

Crews conducted burnout operations on the northeast end of the fire in the South Canyon Point area. Crews also conducted two miles of burnout operations overnight along Cape Royal Road to help prevent new fire spread on the Walhalla Plateau.

Arizona State Route 67 is open, but the roads to Point Imperial and to Cape Royal are closed.",,video,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/videos/10154176905451233/,2016-07-18 13:19:21,775,59,371,608,8,57,0,99,3

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

KAYENTA – More than 30 temporary storage tanks are on fire this morning, July 12, near the community of Nageezi, New Mexico after an explosion at a WPX Energy property, located about 36 miles south of Bloomfield, New Mexico. 

One family had to be evacuated, said Kelly Swan, spokesperson for WPX Energy, which produces oil and natural gas. 

""That's what's on fire right now,"" Swan said. 

Swan says when the explosion occurred at about 11:15 p.m. on Monday, there was no drilling going on and there was no drilling rig at the property located near the intersection of County Road 7890 and U.S. Highway 550. 

""The immediate priority is the safety of the immediate community (where a majority of the residents are Diné allottees),"" Swan said.

Swan added that one family living adjacent to the 5-acre WPX property was evacuated about two hours after the explosion. 

The fire though will burn for several more hours.

""Right now, the fire is intense enough that it is safest for the firefighters to establish a perimeter around the site, that no body can get access to it,"" Swan added. ""(The) first order of business is let the fire burn out itself. That's the safest thing for everyone.""

The Nageezi Chapter is currently serving as a safe haven this morning for members of the community.

The cause of the explosion is unknown and there were no report of any injuries, Swam said.",,status,,2016-07-12 10:11:43,196,19,71,141,2,37,1,12,3

By Cindy Yurth
Tséyi' Bureau
 

WINDOW ROCK — The father of Diana Zacarias, the 22-year-old tourist from Louisiana who disappeared April 2 from Grand Canyon National Park, believes she might be on the Navajo Nation or another Arizona Indian reservation.
""Please ask your people to look for her,"" pleaded Alejandro Zacarias of Natchitoche, Louisiana. ""We're running out of resources.""
Zacarias said a search by the family and the National Park Service in the canyon has revealed no clues, and he now thinks Diana may have gone to live with a Native American tribe.
""She always said someday she would like to go and live with the Indians,"" he said. Zacarias said he also plans to contact the Havasupai Tribe at the bottom of the canyon.
In an interview with Univision, Zacarias said Diana had called her family Friday, April 1, saying she had toured the canyon and wanted to do another hike the next morning. Her mother had reminded her that her flight from Flagstaff back to Louisiana was at 5:30 p.m., so she should make sure to be back on time.
Saturday, Diana's parents followed her Facebook page and saw beautiful photos of Diana and the Grand Canyon, Zacarias said.
Later that afternoon, Diana's mother, worried she would miss her flight, texted her daughter, ""Dianita, are you already on your way to the airport?""
According to Zacarias, Diana texted back, ""No, I am not going.""
That was the last they heard from her. Phone calls went straight to voicemail, which wasn't like her, her father said.
Zacarias and his wife reported Diana missing that evening and jumped in their car for the 20-hour drive to Flagstaff, arriving the following Monday. They discovered Diana had never checked in with the airline and never changed her reservation.
The Park Service mounted a full-scale search-and-rescue operation by land and air on Wednesday, but found no trace of the young woman.
Zacarias said his daughter was a model student at Northwestern State University of Louisiana, where she was a junior majoring in industrial engineering. She had never expressed a desire to leave home and had no reason to, he added — but he recalled her stating on multiple occasions that she would someday like to live on a Native American reservation.
""This is really the only hope I have, that she has gone to live among the Navajos or other Indians,"" he said. ""Please help us find our daughter.""
Diana is described as a petite Latina, about 5-foot-2 and slim, with short dark hair. In her last Facebook posts, she was wearing a pink hat, purple sweater and glasses.

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

PAGE, Ariz. – The family of a Diné woman who was fatally shot by a Winslow, Arizona police officer three months ago filed a $10.5 million wrongful death lawsuit against the city on Friday. 

The claim states that Officer Austin J. Shipley violated the civil rights of 27-year-old Loreal Juana Barnell-Tsingine in the shooting and that ""the city of Winslow was negligent in hiring, training, retaining, controlling and supervising"" Shipley. 

The claim also states that the city ""uniformly ignored warning signs that Austin Shipley was a threat to the public.""

According to the claim, at least two field training officers who trained Shipley had concerns about his work, including being ""quick to go for his … weapon when dealing with people,"" falsifying reports, among others that the officers wrote in their daily notes during his training in 2013. 

Shipley allegedly shot and killed Tsingine on Easter, March 27. Shipley responded to a shoplifting call at a Winslow convenience store where Tsingine was shot five times after allegedly brandishing a pair of scissors at Shipley that evening outside. 

The claim names the city of Winslow, Shipley, and Winslow Police Chief Stephen Garnett as defendants. Tsingine's 8-year-old daughter, Tiffany Robbins, and her husband, Michael Tsingine, are the claimants. 

Shipley remains on standard, paid administrative leave since the March shooting. An investigation has been conducted but not yet made public.",,status,,2016-07-01 23:02:10,528,50,122,470,10,28,0,13,7

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

KAIBETO, Ariz. – Two children were killed, one child was flown to the hospital, and a portion of Arizona Route 98 was closed sometime around Monday afternoon after a Pepsi semi truck and a motorhome collided on the roadway Monday afternoon.

The roadway between mileposts 332 and 334 will be closed for at least six hours, said Police Sgt. Mike Wischmann of the Page, Arizona, Police Department.

Wischmann said according to witnesses, the driver of the Pepsi truck was traveling westbound (toward Page) and went left of center into the eastbound lane, colliding with the side of a motorhome with at least eight persons in it.

Wischmann said two children were pronounced dead at the scene and a 10-year-old was flown to Flagstaff Medical Center by Guardian Air.

Police have rerouted all eastbound traffic toward Navajo Route 21 then onto U.S. Highway 160, and all westbound traffic have been rerouted back toward 160.

Wischmann said there aren't a lot of accidents on SR 98 and this is the first one of this magnitude that he has seen.

""We do have serious-injury accidents like this but generally they are few and far between,"" Wischmann said. ""Usually … somebody's going in the opposite lane of traffic –– speeding or passing where they shouldn't.""

Wischmann said with the tourism traffic in Lake Powell Country this time of year, the police are encouraging people to slow down.

""Especially with Fourth of July weekend coming up,"" he said. ""A lot of the problems we (law enforcement agencies) are seeing is (motorists) passing when they shouldn't, excessive speeds, and hazardous driving. We want everyone to be wearing their seatbelt and to be cautious, and not to be texting and driving.""

By Bill Donovan
Special to the Times
 
PHOENIX — A registered voter in Navajo County has filed a challenge to the candidacy of Candace Begody-Begay.
Begody-Begay is running in the Republican primary for Arizona State Senate District 7, a position that is currently held by her husband, Caryle Begay, who has filed to run in the Republican primary for Congress.
In his complaint, Eric Kramer is claiming that Begody-Begay, a former editor for the Navajo Times, failed to get enough valid signatures to be on the ballot.
She was required under state law to get 294 signatures and turned in 325.
Kramer claims that at lest 226 of the signatures she collected are not valid.
In some cases, the signer was not a registered voter or was not registered as a Republican. Others, he said, were not registered in the district for which she is running.
There are also cases, Kramer said, where the signer signed the petition more than once or signed the petition of another candidate. Arizona election law allows a person to sign only one petition during each election period.
In several cases, he said, the signer's address does not match the one on his or her voter registration card.
A hearing on the claim is scheduled to be held on June 24 before a superior court judge in Phoenix.
Begody-Begay does not have any opposition in the Republican primary.
A total of 12 challenges were filed against candidates running in this year's primary. Two of them have since been withdrawn leaving 10 to be decided in court hearings.",,status,,2016-06-16 16:48:38,28,3,1,24,0,3,0,1,0

            Mayor Bill Diak says the overlook, which is part of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, has gotten so popular that the city and the Park Service have to do something to not only protect it, but to offer a better experience for those wanting to view the spectacular, almost circular meander of the Colorado River.

            ""The congestion – getting in and out of the parking lot, the number of people trying to do the trail, which is very, very cumbersome for most people,"" Diak explained. ""And doing those improvements, we're looking … to change the visitor's experience. How do we make it better?""

            Officials at a June 2 open house, which took place at the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area headquarters, said a master plan is needed to provide a high-quality visitor experience, improve accessibility, address safety concerns and prevent resource damage.

A second open house is slated for tomorrow (Tuesday) from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. DST at Page City Hall on Vista Ave.

            ""We're trying to collect as many ideas as we can so … we build a plan for that,"" Diak said. ""It's going to be a big project and we want as much input as we can get. We want to satisfy our people who live here and to satisfy (the visitors).""

            Officials said the idea of a master plan started more than a year ago.

            ""Now we're into building the plan stage,"" Diak said. ""We can come up with a lot of ideas but they might not fit somebody else's ideas.""

            A Diné woman from Bitter Springs, Ariz., who did not want to be named, said her ideas include permission for Navajo jewelers to sell their handiwork.

            ""We (the Navajo Nation) had to give up part of our land for the city of Page,"" the woman said. ""The city should give people consideration because not everyone wants to move away to find a job. That's how we can support (ourselves) –– we want in on the action of tourism too.""

            The woman also said she'd like to see railings at the overlook seeing as visitors ""are all over the place.""

            ""The (Colorado River) is a sacred river –– to the Natives, it's sacred,"" the woman added. ""People should not be climbing and crawling. Visitors need to have respect for the Natives.""

            Meanwhile, officials said there could possibly be a fee, which Diak said visitors could pay down the road.

            ""But no decisions have been made,"" Diak said. ""Public input has a lot to do with that.""

            Officials said they are currently working on emergency improvements at the overlook. Improvements include designated parking areas for RVs, boats, and buses; and widening the entrance, among others.

NAATSIS'ÁÁN-RAINBOW CITY, Utah – Ryan Hueston says his late grandfather would be proud of a renovation project he is spearheading here.
""It's a really beautiful thing to hear my family say that my grandpa, (Harold Drake Sr.), would be proud of this (project),"" said Hueston, Diné-Anglo, whose family lives in Newport Beach, Calif. but calls Navajo Mountain home.
The Navajo Mountain Boarding School Project, Hueston's team says, aims to empower the community's creative potential through renovation and reinvention of Navajo Mountain Boarding School into a community center.
Hueston says his grandmother, Stella Rose Begay-Drake, 94, taught there and his mother, Mabelle Drake Hueston, along with her siblings went to school there.
Ryan Hueston said the defunct boarding school buildings have always been vacant since he was a child.
""I've always heard stories about them,"" he said. ""And they've always been architecturally fascinating to me.""
In terms of what they represent historically, he says, the buildings symbolize cultural hybridity, meaning the blending of elements from different cultures.
""The buildings are a hybrid as well … of Navajo hogan architecture and of Western architecture (from the Progressive Era) when John Collier, (former Commissioner of Indian Affairs), created the second era of boarding schools,"" Ryan Hueston explained. ""(These) are buildings like the ones my grandfather was taken to in Tuba City where his hair was cut off … abused, and beaten if he spoke his language.""
Ryan Hueston said the vacancy and the potential of the old buildings here, which are located near the senior center, is special.
""(They) hold so many memories and so much energy that (they) need some sort of catalyst,"" he said. ""There's so much use.""
Ryan Hueston says the project had some rumblings about it being an arts and culture center, an archives center, among others for people visiting the area.
""But my dream has always been an arts and culture center just because there's so much to be taught,"" he said. ""I see the elders getting older, like Mary Ann Owl, (San Juan Southern Paiute basket maker). It's getting harder for (elders) to gather stuff. And I want a new generation to be able to do that, taught by the (elders), how they're supposed to be taught, first hand with experience.""
Ryan Hueston says the project ultimately is about creating a space for that, which the Center for Art and Public Life at California College of the Arts' IMPACT Social Entrepreneurship Award allowed him and his team to do.
On April 7, Ryan Hueston and his team – Graeme Aegerter, Magdalena Härtelova, Lillian Makeda, and Ella Schoefer-Wulf – were presented one of the three $10,000 grants ""to create innovative and creative solutions to social problems by collaborating with community experts and partners.""
The Navajo Mountain Boarding School Project team arrived here on Wednesday and began work on Thursday morning.
The team is now seeking volunteers to help fulfill the project.
Team member Schoefer-Wulf, a German-American writer who's studying at CCA for a master's degree, says a community dinner will take place today, June 13, outside the boarding schools at 4:30 p.m. and dinner will be served at 5:30 p.m.
""We want the community dinner to be an opportunity for people to have a look at the buildings and we will present the project and the history of the boarding school to everyone,"" Schoefer-Wulf said. ""We want this to be a time to share stories of the past and ideas about how we can best use this space in the future, and how we can serve the community.""
Those interested in helping with the project can email the team at mountainschoolproject@gmail.com.

 GALLUP — The man alleged to have kidnapped two young boys from Wheatfields Lake Saturday was located by New Mexico State Police and the FBI Monday, but no charges have been filed pending further investigation, according to an FBI press release.
 Vivian Randolph, the mother of the boys and the girlfriend of the alleged kidnapper, said FBI agents informed her they had interviewed suspect Clinton Johnson, 26, and released him.
 The press release does not state whether Johnson is in custody.
 Navajo Police Officer Garrett Thomas of the Crownpoint Police District said Lyric Gray, 5, and his brother, Kerwin Gray, 7, were found in an abandoned white Oldsmobile Alero off of Red Beard Road, about 10 miles west of here Sunday afternoon. The children are in the custody of Navajo Nation Social Services.
 Randolph had told police Johnson had driven off with the children.
 She says she fears for herself and her family since Johnson is not custody.
 ""How am I supposed to make sure my family, myself, my kids are going to be safe?"" she said. ""If he was captured ... why didn't they call me? They have my information on how to get a hold of me.
 ""So who releases a person that kidnaps another father's children?"" Randolph continued during an interview with the Navajo Times.

Navajo Times
 
GALLUP, N.M. – An Amber Alert was canceled Sunday afternoon after two missing Diné brothers were found safe. But police are still looking for the suspect who took the boys. 
Navajo Police Officer Garrett Thomas of the Crownpoint Police District said Lyric Gray, 5, and his brother, Kerwin Gray, 7, were found in an abandoned white Oldsmobile Alero off of Red Beard Road, about 10 miles west of here. 
The Amber Alert was issued this morning around 12:50 a.m. for the brothers after their mother, Vivian Johnson, reported that her boyfriend, Clinton Johnson, 26, took the boys following a verbal confrontation between the two. 
The alert was first issued in Utah early Sunday morning. However, it was cancelled by the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification shortly after 8 a.m. when officials no longer believed the suspect was headed for the Beehive State. The alert though remained in effect in Arizona and in New Mexico until the boys were found shortly after noon. 
Vivian Johnson said she took her family camping on Friday in Wheatfields Lake, Ariz. to celebrate her birthday. 
""Everything was OK, nothing happened on Friday,"" Vivian Johnson said. ""It wasn't until Saturday afternoon that I noticed Clinton was acting funny. I don't recall him pulling out any beer at all … on this trip."" 
Around 3 p.m. on Saturday, Vivian Johnson said, Clinton Johnson started arguing with her about keys to their car.
""I kept repeating myself, 'I don't have the keys!',"" Vivian Johnson said. ""I left it alone, but he (started) cursing at me and calling me names."" 
When Johnson found the keys to their car, he got in. At that time, the brothers, along with their older brother, Raydell, were playing in the water. 
Later he started another argument, Vivian Johnson said. 
""He continued,"" Vivian Johnson said. ""I didn't want to get into an altercation with him because I didn't want it to go beyond that extent where he would start beating me. So I left it alone."" 
Vivian Johnson said she had more than $200 in the glove compartment of the car  that she was saving for the children. At one point, she told Raydell to get the money out of the glove compartment.
Clinton Johnson however saw what Raydell was doing and stopped him. Then another argument ignited.
""I was hoping that our neighbors who were fishing not too far from us would call the cops for us if they hear us arguing and yelling,"" Vivian Johnson said. ""Knowing the fact that the kids were there, but nobody helped us at all."" 
New Mexico residents say they received the alert shortly after 10 a.m. on Sunday reading, ""Chinle, AZ AMBER Alert: LIC/238TMB (NM) White Oldsmobile Alero."" 
According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children's AMBER Alert Program, the suspect, Clinton Johnson, took the children in a white 2000 Oldsmobile Alero and may have headed towards Mentmore, N.M. 
Vivian Johnson said Clinton is from Mentmore, where he is originally from. Clinton Johnson is reported to be 5 feet 5 inches tall with tattoos reading ""Johnson"" on his left forearm and ""Kiarra"" on his left hand. His ring, middle, and index fingers on his left hand are missing.

By Krista Allen
Navajo Times

            TUBA CITY – Officers from the Flagstaff and the Northern Arizona University Police Departments fatally shot a Diné man after he attempted to carjack an individual at gunpoint on Monday morning.

            According to a Flagstaff Police Department press release, Verl Bedonie, 26, from Tónaneesdizí was shot and killed after leading police on a foot chase that ended in a confrontation in the Plaza Vieja neighborhood where the investigation reveals that Bedonie fired one round at the officers.

            Before the deadly shooting, Flagstaff Police received a called around 7:48 a.m. (Arizona time) reporting a Native American man carrying what looked like a BB gun, which turned out to be a 9 millimeter handgun, inside the High Country Conference Center where officers discovered Bedonie holding a firearm.

            Bedonie ignored commands to drop his weapon and left the conference center and walked west along Butler Avenue, toward South Milton Road, according to police.

            While walking across Drury Inn's parking lot, near the north campus of NAU, Bedonie was seen turning towards pursuing officers, raising his gun at one of the officers. FPD's Cpl. Ben Sandoval and Officer Eric Tomperi responded by firing a total of five shots, all of them missing Bedonie.

            With the officers approximately 20 to 30 yards behind him, commanding him to stop, Bedonie then walked across South Milton Road.

            Officers followed Bedonie westbound on West Clay Avenue, where he started running northbound on South Florence Street.

            ""At one point, the suspect pointed his gun at a taxi cab driver parked at the carwash located on Clay,"" a FPD press release states. ""Schools in the area were ordered on lockdown…""

            Police believe that Bedonie fired one round in an alley between South Florence Street and South Park Street.

            When an undercover Flagstaff police officer arrived to the area in an unmarked vehicle, the officer saw Bedonie get into the passenger side of a vehicle, in which Bedonie pointed a gun at the driver and demanded to be taken to Phoenix.

            Believing that Bedonie would either take the driver hostage or harm him, the officer decided to ram the driver's vehicle to prevent it from moving.

            ""When the vehicle was struck, the suspect who had been in the passenger seat exited the vehicle, walking around the car to the north side of the street,"" the release states. ""Numerous officers at the scene continued to give commands for the suspect to drop the gun…""

            Bedonie raised the gun towards the officers and was shot.

            Shortly after the shooting, it was discovered that one of the officer's rounds penetrated a residence, injuring a dog, which is expected to recover after surgery.",,status,,2016-05-24 10:03:49,436,116,195,328,0,64,2,37,5

By Bill Donovan

Special to the Times

 

            WINDOW ROCK – Window Rock District Court Judge Carol Perry Tuesday gave former council delegate Mel R. Begay a three-year tribal jail sentence after being found guilty of conspiracy and nine counts of submitting false vouchers.

            She also is requiring him to pay restitution of  $33,400 and pay fines totaling $5,000. Those must be paid immediately, Perry said.

            The three-year sentence is not three years, however. Under tribal law a person earns one day of good time for every day served if no jail rules are violated.

            Begay was ordered to begin serving the time immediately even though his attorney urged Perry to allow his client time to get his affairs in order and allow time for the appeals process to go through.

            Perry, after listening to his argument, adjourned the court and Begay was escorted downstairs to begin serving his jail time.

            It was brought up during the two hours of debate over sentencing that Begay was offered a plea agreement before the trial that that would have required him to pay only $17,000 in restitution and no jail time.

            Begay turned down the proposal, according to his attorney, because he did not and still does not feel he violated any criminal law in approving 59 requests from his family for grants from the tribal discretionary fund.",,status,,2016-05-18 09:31:56,507,113,97,450,3,21,28,1,4

By Christopher S. Pineo

Navajo Times

 

GALLUP – The Amber Alert System worked in Gallup on May 5, as two children were rescued when a Motel 6 employee called police.

            The employee made the call after receiving an Amber Alert issued from Utah, and officers were dispatched at 4:06 a.m. according to a statement from the Gallup Police Department.

            Marae Montoya, 3, and Cynthia Montoya, 11 months, went missing from the home of a babysitter in Clinton, Utah at around 3 p.m. on Thursday and were rescued within 14 hours. The Amber Alert was issued within seven hours of the abduction according to a post on the Department of Justice's official Amber Alert account on Twitter – just before 11 p.m. Thursday.

            Gallup's Lt. Rosanne Morrissette said the clerk and locals may have been paying closer attention to the Amber Alert System after a recent Amber Alert on the Navajo Nation for an 11-year-old girl whose funeral was held on May 6 in Shiprock. That Amber Alert took more than 10 hours to activate after that incident took place on Monday at 4 p.m.

            ""It's hard to say why it took that long,"" she said. ""Authorities didn't have information at the time. On this one the authorities had immediate information.""

            She said the alert from the previous case may have heightened awareness.

            ""This clerk at the Motel 6, she really paid attention,"" Morrissette said.

Gallup police arrested Christopher John Montoya, 35, and Monica Jody Martinez, 27, without incident according to a police report. Police await extradition of the two, who are parents of the children, to Utah at McKinley County Adult Detention Center, while Children Youth and Family Department has the two children in custody.

            Morrissette said police in Utah will have to come to New Mexico to retrieve the suspects.

            According to Gallup PD the children were unharmed and police bought diapers, formula, and other items to care for the children. Morrissette said the arresting officer noticed that the room contained no such items for childcare.

            ""Immediately, Sgt. Emery Holly initiated the purchase of diapers, formula, and other items that the children needed,"" Morrissette said.

            Morrissette wanted to remind the community of the importance of responding to Amber Alerts by calling authorities as the clerk did.

            ""Just continue to be alert,"" she said. ""Take these Amber Alerts very serious.""",,status,,2016-05-09 15:24:28,1055,37,136,970,33,9,0,1,0

CHINLE - A Chinle High School student died Saturday morning while crossing Clear Creek near Winslow, Ariz. on a zip line during a JROTC training exercise.

According to a press release from the Navajo County Sheriff's Office, Marisa Trujillo, 17, unclipped herself from the zip line about halfway across the creek and plunged 60 feet into the creek at about 11:30 a.m.

Witnesses told sheriff's deputies other students had done this in the past as a daredevil stunt and had swum to shore unhurt. Trujillo allegedly had told other students she was planning to unclip herself and the students said they had tried to discourage her.

A diver stationed in the creek as a precaution swam out to where she entered the water within seconds, the witnesses told deputies, but was unable to find her.

The Winslow dive team recovered her body two hours later.

Eulogy: 'Our little Angel, whose life was short-lived'

Navajo Times

 

FARMINGTON – Ashlynne Mike's little white casket was placed in the center of the Farmington Civic Center stage Friday morning surrounded with colorful, bright flowers.

With a slide show of pictures of her playing the xylophone, as well as her artwork she had drawn, her family stood up and spoke about their unique and talented daughter and sister.

 ""How do I begin a farewell, when I still can't believe you're gone,"" said Pamela Foster as she gave her daughter's eulogy. ""Our little Angel, whose life was short-lived. However, her beauty and magic will linger forever in our hearts and in those for whom she's touched.""

 Before the beginning of the services it was announced that there were 3,000 people waiting outside wanting to attend the service. Since it was first reported of Ashlynne's abduction Monday, there had been a widespread support throughout the Navajo Nation and New Mexico to help find her. When it was reported Ashlynne's body was found not far from the Shiprock Pinnacle the next day, an even greater amount of support came together to show their grief and outrage.

 ""I'm heartbroken as I stand here today,"" said New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez who spoke at Ashlynne's funeral. ""The many people who loved Ashlynne described her as fun loving and always smiling. She was kind and quiet. She would've gone on to make a much better place.""

 Ashlynne's untimely, tragic death had sparked the conversation as to why the Navajo Nation lacks an Amber Alert system that could've possibly help locate her a lot sooner after she and her younger brother Ian Mike were abducted. 

 Tom Begaye Jr., 27, of Waterflow, N.M., was later arrested in connection with the abduction.

 As he spoke about his little sister, Ryan Begay said when he heard about Ashlynne's disappearance he drove to the Shiprock Pinnacle with a friend and searched for her. He said he had reported Ashlynne's disappearance at 10:30 p.m. but the alert didn't go out until 2:30 a.m. the next morning.

 ""I wish this alert went out sooner when I called it,"" said Ryan Begay. ""That night I heard she was kidnapped, I spent a long time at the pinnacle driving late at night. I needed help. I thought that there would be a lot more people out there.""

 Aside from the family's disappointment in the lack of response from authorities they also spoke emotionally on the kind of little girl Ashlynne was. Her older sister Brittany Begay, said Ashlynne was a talented artist. 

It was mentioned how much the fifth-grade student from Ojo Amarillo Elementary loved playing the xylophone and piano, and was a gifted student having made student of the month numerous of times and had near perfect attendance.

 ""She was such a sweet, funny little sister,"" said Brittany. ""She was so creative. She would sit by me and watch me as I draw and try to mimic it…sometimes I would get our art work confused because she was that good.""",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10154001999121233/?type=3,2016-05-06 16:21:22,12157,591,2902,8457,664,4,5,3007,20

CHINLE — Tom Begaye Jr. of Waterflow, N.M., made his initial appearance Wednesday morning on charges of kidnapping and murder in connection with the abduction and killing of 11-year-old Ashlynne Mike on Monday.
At the appearance before Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones in Farmington, Begaye was determined to qualify for a court-appointed attorney. His preliminary hearing was set for Friday at the federal courthouse in Albuquerque. A detention hearing will also take place at that time. He will remain in federal custody until then.
Elizabeth Martinez, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Mexico, said a plea is not generally offered at an initial appearance on a federal charge, ""and anyway, he wouldn't enter a plea until he has the benefit of counsel.""
According to the criminal complaint, Begaye enticed Ashlynne and her nine-year-old brother, Ian, into his van near Shiprock Monday evening and drove them toward the Shiprock pinnacle. Ian told investigators Begaye parked the car and took his sister out of the car, carrying a piece of metal. He allegedly returned an hour later, carrying the piece of metal but without Ashlynne.
Begaye then told Ian to get out of the vehicle and drove away, Ian told investigators. He and another witness were able to provide a description of both Begaye and his vehicle to investigators, who located and arrested Begaye at a sweat lodge near Shiprock.
Police found Ashlynne's body near Navajo Route 13. Her injuries were consistent with blunt force trauma to the head.
If convicted of kidnapping a minor, Begaye faces a minimum of 20 years in prison. The murder charge carries a minimum of life in prison.
The FBI and Navajo Nation Division of Public Safety investigated the case with assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service, New Mexico State Police, San Juan county Sheriff's Office and the Farmington Police Department.

  SAN JUAN- Ashlynne Mike, 11, played the xylophone and was in fifth grade at Ojo Amarilo Elementary. 

  On Monday, she along with her brother Ian Mike were abducted by a man who reportedly was driving a maroon van with tinted windows in the Fruitland area.  Ian was able to escape, but Ashlynne wasn't. Her body was found Tuesday morning near the Shiprock pinnacle. Tuesday evening, the FBI announced they had arrested a suspect in the case: Tom Begaye, 27, of Waterflow, N.M.

  ""The community responded really well today,"" said Shawn Mike, cousin to Ashlynne's dad, Gary Mike. ""Thank you for your support.""

  Shawn Mike continued to rehash the day Ashlynne and Ian were taken. Shawn said his nine-year-old son had also encountered the man in the van and he too was offered a ride, with the enticement of seeing the movie ""Zootopia."" When that failed, Shawn Mike recounted, the man simply offered to take the boy home from school. 

  ""The threat of child abduction is real,"" said Shawn Mike. ""My son was approached by this van ... They asked, 'We're going to the movies' ... and my son said no ... My son came home and said 'Dad, Ian and Ashlynne are in the van. Ashlynne was waving at me,' not knowing her fate."" 
  
Tuesday,Ashlynne's body was found approximately 6 miles south of the Shiprock Monument. 

  ""This is like an atomic bomb dropped on a community,"" said San Juan Chapter President Rick Nez. 

  Tuesday night hundreds of grievers came out in solidarity, reacting to the tragic news. 

  ""It's a big weight off your shoulder knowing the suspect was found,"" said Graham Beyale who was one of the volunteers in the search party for Ashlynne. ""It's heartwarming to see all these people here for her."" 

  What came out of the vigil was not only remembering the precious little girl. It also sparked a conversation on needed laws on the Navajo Nation regarding sex offenders and child molesters, as well as encouraging an honest dialogue between parents and children.

By Cindy Yurth
Tséyi' Bureau
 
CHINLE — Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye and Speaker LoRenzo Bates blasted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at a field hearing in Phoenix Friday regarding the Gold King Mine Spill.
Over the eight months since the spill, Begaye told the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, ""the USEPA has avoided any real sense of accountability for its actions, even though it repeatedly and publicly claimed responsibility last fall.""
Among other things, Begaye charged that the EPA has yet to fully compensate the Navajo Nation or individual Navajo farmers; that it has yet to designate the Upper Animas Mining District as a Superfund site and that it has not given the Navajo Nation the tools it needs to conduct its own testing and mitigate future impacts.
Bates, who represents most of the chapters affected by the spill, said the EPA must provide ""assurances and tangible evidence"" to Navajo farmers that their livestock and agricultural products will be safe for sale and consumption.
He added that the different entities testing the water were providing inconsistent information, which confuses the public.
""I urge all of the entities involved in monitoring the Animas River and the San Juan River to coordinate and to speak with one consistent voice when informing the Navajo people,"" he said.
Both leaders stressed that the river is important to Navajo spirituality.
""The spill has contaminated or destroyed many of the essential elements of our
religious practice, and desecrated a river that we have treated with reverence since time
immemorial,"" Bates said.
Mathy Stanislaus, assistant administrator of the Office of Land and Emergency Management within the EPA, testified that the agency has already spent $22 million on response efforts and planned to do more, including continued monitoring of the river, fish and soil, and providing support for the Navajo Environmental Protection Agency.
""We are currently reviewing additional costs incurred by the Navajo government,"" he said.
Stanislaus admitted that the agency ""could improve its communications regarding releases and other environmental events that affect multiple jurisdictions.""",,status,,2016-04-22 20:16:31,265,13,89,240,1,1,0,4,19

By Cindy Yurth

KYKOTSMOVI, Ariz. — Four Navajo ranchers must raise over $4,000 and procure enough stock trailers to move 66 head of cattle by 9 a.m. tomorrow (Tuesday) in order to get their cattle out of impoundment.
The cows were impounded last Tuesday by Hopi Rangers who said John Benally, Irene Benally, Ruth Benally and Lita O'Daniel did not have current permits to run cattle on Hopi Partitioned Land.
""They (the cattle) were trespassing on HPL land,"" explained Lt. Virgil Platero of the Hopi Rangers. ""Our policy is to impound them, and if no one gets them out of impound in five days, we take them to auction.""
The five days are up tomorrow, and after meeting with Priscilla Pavatea, director of the Hopi Office of Rangeland Management, the Navajos were given until 9 a.m. tomorrow to raise $4,284 plus whatever impoundment fees accrue overnight and take the cattle somewhere else.
Grassroots activist Elouise Brown, who is advocating for the ranchers, said Monday evening a safe place for the cattle has been secured and she is trying to get the Navajo Department of Agriculture to supply some cattle trucks to move the herd.
O'Daniel said she had failed to renew her permit because she was in the hospital following a car accident. Irene Benally said she is willing to renew her permit, originally obtained by her mother and never officially transferred, but was told it would not be ready until next year.
""Where am I supposed to put my cows in the meantime?"" she asked.
Added O'Daniel, whose Angus bull was impounded, ""The tribe is always buying land. Why can't they give us some land for our cattle?""

CHINLE — A case involving human remains removed from Canyon de Chelly has been remanded to U.S. District Court for Arizona.
On April 6, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the district court's dismissal of the case, saying the National Park Service's letter refusing to turn the remains over to the Navajo Nation was ""final agency action,"" and thus obligates the U.S. Government to waive its sovereign immunity in the case.
The U.S. Department of the Interior had claimed the government was protected by sovereign immunity and could not be sued in this instance.
The Navajo Nation claims that over 300 human remains were removed from the canyon over the years following archeological expeditions. They are currently housed at the Western Archeological and Conservation Center in Tucson. The tribe wants to rebury the remains in Canyon de Chelly.
""The Nation's position is that the Nation has the right of control over the remains because they were removed without its consent from tribal trust lands affirmed as reservation land under the treaty (of 1868),"" the Navajo Nation Office of the Attorney General stated in a press release. 
""Therefore, the National Park Service does not have 'possession or control' as required to allow it to conduct a cultural affiliation determination under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the release reads.",,status,,2016-04-07 16:35:53,343,40,128,283,2,28,0,20,10

FRUITLAND— An aerial sightseeing trip came to an unexpected end Monday morning when high winds turned over a propeller plane that left one passenger hospitalized.
The plane successfully landed on the runway at Shiprock Airport around 11:30 a.m., before winds flipped it over, according to Navajo Department of Transportation Senior Public Information Officer Carl Slater.
Slater said the pilot of the plane, Joe Tumminaro, was transported to San Juan Regional Medical Center for non-life threatening injuries, while passenger Ryan Arroyo, walked away from the incident, but received medical attention as a precaution.
""They came out here to do some sightseeing,"" Slater said. ""They landed and high winds flipped it over as it was moving down the runway. The crash was after it already landed.""
At about 7 p.m., Slater said the plane had been removed and Navajo D.O.T crew was cleaning up debris from the runway. He added that the airport would reopen at 8 a.m., Friday morning.
Slater said Tumminaro and Arroyo, both from Durango, Colo., were on a sightseeing trip when they landed on the airstrip.
He said the winds were strong enough to roll the plane over once before it came to a standstill. First responders showed up shortly after. Slater said Tumminaro needed assistance getting out of the plane while Arroyo was able to get out on his own.
Slater said NNDOT was made aware of the incident at about 2:15 p.m., and NNDOT officials then alerted the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board.
He said both the FAA and NTSB will look into the incident and the FAA will conduct their own investigation from their headquarters in Chicago.
""They're not going to come out because they don't think it was severe enough to take a look into,"" he said.
As of Monday evening, San Juan Regional Medical Center spokeswoman Laura Werbner said Tumminaro remained hospitalized.

            CHINLE — The Winslow Police officer who shot and killed a 27-year-old Navajo woman Sunday has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, according to a press release from the Winslow Police Department.

            The release states Loreal Tsingine of Winslow was shot while struggling with an officer who was trying to take her into custody as a suspect in a shoplifting incident at the Circle K store at 323 North Williamson Ave.

            According to the release, police had responded to the shoplifting call about 4 p.m. and found Tsingine, who fit the description employees gave of the shoplifter, in the 100 block of West Fourth Street.

            ""While attempting to take the subject into custody, a struggle ensued,"" the release reads. ""At this time the subject displayed a weapon which presented a substantial threat to the officer. The officer discharged his weapon resulting in the unfortunate death"" of Tsingine.

By Bill Donovan
Special to the Times

    WINDOW ROCK - It took a Navajo jury less than two and a half hours, including a supper break, to find Navajo Nation Council Delegate Mel Begay guilty of all charges.
    Begay, who represents Coyote Canyon, Mexican Springs, Naschitti, Tohatchi and Bahastl'a'a' chapter, sat quietly as he watched Window Rock District Court Judge Carol Perry read from each of the 10 charges and pronounced him guilty.
    Because of the conviction, he will lose his seat on the council and may even get a possible jail sentence, which would make him the first sitting council delegate to ever be sent to tribal jail.
    He will also face having to make restitution of the $33,000 that he was accused of taking from the tribal discretionary fund program and giving to his children between 2006 and 2010.
    That's going to be a lesser burden because when he is removed from the council, he will be eligible for his deferred comp which, given the years he has been in office will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $75,000 to $85,000.
    Perry scheduled Begay's sentencing for May 17. Until then he will continue to be released on his own recognizance.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10153897226311233/?type=3,2016-03-25 14:11:46,778,364,401,629,4,45,28,13,59

CHINLE — Unofficial election results show two of the three counties that overlap the Navajo Nation have chosen Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as the Republican and Democratic nominees for President, respectively, in the Arizona Presidential preference election.
The results mirror the rest of the state so far, with 404 of 487 districts reporting.
Coconino County, however, was bucking the Democratic trend, with Bernie Sanders ahead of Clinton by more than 1,200 votes. Ninety-one percent of its precincts had reported as of 11 p.m.
Among registered Democrats in Navajo county, Clinton logged 2,121 votes to Bernie Sanders' 1,278, not quite a two-to-one margin. Martin J. O'Malley trailed with 80 votes, followed fairly closely by Roque De La Fuente (58), Michael Steinberg (55) and Henry Hewes (37).
Navajo County Republicans picked Trump over Ted Cruz by a similar margin, 2,360 to 1,739. Marco Rubio was a distant third at 616 votes, followed by John R.Kasich with 292 and Ben Carson with 236. The rest of the field was in single or double digits.
Apache County gave Trump a narrower lead, 1,724 to 1,336 for Cruz, and Kasich was the third-place finisher there with 202 votes. Democrats chose Hillary (3,010) over Sanders (1,562).
Coconino, which includes Flagstaff and is by far the most populous of the rez counties, gave Sanders 6,941 votes to Clinton's 5,738. If the results hold up after all the precincts have reported, it will be the only Arizona County to go for Sanders.
The county's Republicans, however, followed Arizona's trend, with 3,324 for Trump, 2,843 for Cruz and 1,058 for Rubio.
So far, Arizona as a whole is overwhelming opting for Trump (206,544 votes, or 46 percent) and Clinton (210,026 or 60 percent) over Cruz (101,208, 23 percent) and Sanders (130,248, 37 percent) in their respective races.
In the Green Party primary, Jill Stein had a commanding lead with 505 votes to Kent Mesplay's 108.",,status,,2016-03-22 23:59:34,310,121,153,210,4,22,2,7,65

By Cindy Yurth
Tseyi' Bureau

 WINDOW ROCK  — An informal exit poll at the Navajo Nation Museum, the polling place in the Navajo Nation's capital, showed Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in a dead heat among Democratic voters in Arizona's Presidential preference election between 2 and 3 p.m.
 In general, voters under 40 were feeling the Bern while those middle-aged and up were leaning toward Clinton.
 Only two Republican voters surfaced during that time (at least among those who would talk to a Times reporter). One voted for Donald Trump while the other marked her ballot for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
 Davis Begaye, who at 18 was voting in his first Presidential election, typified Sanders' supporters. 
 ""All these others are funded by big companies,"" he said, ""so they'll give them more leeway. If you're for the people, like Bernie, you do things like fix the roads and improve the schools.""
 ""He's more about helping the people than big business,"" echoed Shunah Sandoval, 29, who happened to have taken her daughter to the museum but planned to vote in her home chapter of Rock Springs, N.M.
 The elder crowd, like Louis Begay, 67, remembered Clinton from her stint as head of Legal Services Corp. in the 1970s, when she helped establish DNA People's Legal Services.
 ""She knows us,"" said Begay.
 A handful of female voters admitted they voted for Clinton because they are ready to see a woman president.
 ""Give a lady a chance!"" urged a cheery matron who declined to give her name. ""People are saying a lady can't be a leader. But that's mostly men saying that.""
 The lone Trump supporter to brave the dusty wind gave only his first name, Wally. 
 ""I think he's the one who can change everything around,"" Wally said. ""We need to get this nation back on track.""
 A middle-aged Republican who declined to give her name, on the other hand, said she went for Kasich because ""I'm not voting for Donald Trump, that's for sure.""
 While southern Arizona news sources were reporting long lines at the polls, the flow at Window Rock was slow but steady. Polls on the Navajo Nation will close at 6 p.m. (an hour earlier than the rest of Arizona because of the time difference). According to the Arizona Secretary of State's website, results should start being posted at 8 p.m.Arizona time, which is 9 p.m. on the Navajo Nation.

WINDOW ROCK – U.S. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will make an appearance at the Twin Arrows Casino in Flagstaff on Thursday. 

            Doors open to the public at 5 p.m. and the event is free. According to the Sanders campaign website, the event will be a town hall style event.

            Tickets are not required, but guests are encouraged to RSVP at go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/rally/4gwr8. Admission is on a first come, first serve basis and guests should enter the casino by the main east doors of the building.

            Derrick Watchman, CEO of Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise, told the Navajo Times Wednesday that the Sanders campaign contacted Navajo gaming officials on Tuesday. He also reacted to the news that the campaign would be making a stop on the nation.

""I'm excited,"" said Watchman. ""They reached out to our general manager saying they would like to use our facility because it's on the reservation and it's close to Flagstaff. I'm delighted and excited that they're coming out tomorrow.""

He said he would welcome any and all use of casino facilities for such events.

PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. – After four years of chasing a state title that pursuit came to an end for the Valley Lady Pirates on Saturday morning at the Prescott Valley Events Center.

The top seeded Lady Pirates defeated No. 3 seed Rock Point, 77-40, to claim this year's Arizona Division V title and capped the year at 28-1.

With the win, the Lady Pirates girls' basketball team became the first sports program to win a team championship according to athletic director Marcus Forrester.

In 2013, the Pirates lost the Divison III state title to Winslow by a 45-40 count and last season they came up six points short in the Division IV finals against Phoenix Christian.

""This feels pretty exciting,"" said Valley senior guard Latisha Nastacio. ""I am happy that we won this year; last year it was heartbreaking.""

Nastacio finished the game with 15 but the Pirates got some inspired play from junior Cherelle Speen as she scored 19 points in the opening half as Valley gained a 46-19 advantage at the break.

""I wanted to come out and do this for the team,"" said Speen, who finished with a game-best 23 points. ""I was really motivated by my team and the fans that supported us.""

Valley coach Dorothy Mitchell said the entire team played up to their potential to beat sectional rival Rock Point for the third time this season. 

""The bench also came in and made some key shots and they were playing defense,"" she said. ""They all worked together as a team.""

The Valley coach said the focus from the get go was to contend every shot and make Rock Point work for every made basket.

""We wanted to shut down the three-point shooters,"" she said, while adding that they gave multiple looks on the defensive end.

""We changed everything around and they went with it,"" she said.

Valley also had freshman guard Valiyah Yazzie in double figures with 13.

Rock Point got 14 points from Pashen Johnson while Crystanya Begay added 12.

Lady Cougar coach Lorna Tsosie said it was unfortunate that her team experienced a bad shooting day, especially after they averaged 64.5 points in their first three state playoff games.

""Our shots were not falling for us, especially our threes,"" Tsosie said. ""They tried though. They went up against the odds with all that pressure on them.""

PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. – The Ganado Lady Hornets had to steadied itself to get by top seeded Phoenix Christian on Friday night.

The Hornets hit 11-of-14 free throws in the fourth quarter and held off the Lady Cougars 39-35 in the semifinals of the Division IV state girls basketball tournament at the Prescott Events Center in Prescott Valley, Ariz.

No. 5 Ganado will play No. 2 seed Thatcher in the finals on Saturday at 2 p.m. Thatcher defeated Sedona Red Rock, 58-46, on their side of the bracket.

""That team has talented athletes and that is why they were ranked No. 1 the whole season,"" Ganado coach Mike Bitsuie said of the Lady Cougars. ""But my girls were not scared and we knew that we could take it to them and we knew that we could beat them.""

After taking down Arizona Lutheran by a 52-36 count on Thursday night, Bitsuie said that 16-point victory instilled some much-needed confidence for Friday's game.

""You know they only had two losses but numbers are just numbers,"" he said. ""We knew we could do it and I am just so proud of the girls on how they played tonight.""

Bitsuie said hitting those free throws down the stretch were huge, especially since the Hornets hit a lull at the start of the third quarter. Ganado missed six baskets, including four threes and did not score until junior JaeLynn Curley knocked down a pair of free throws at the 2:41 mark.

""It's hard to get that first one because they (Phoenix Christian) are athletic and tall,"" Bitsuie said. ""It's hard to do our normal cuts and get our passes because they are so lengthy.""

The flow of the game went Ganado's way midway through the fourth quarter as they erased a 30-26 deficit with five minutes left in regulation. Some key steals by the Hornets changed the complexion of the game as a two-point bucket from senior post Tierra James helped start a 9-0 run.

During that stretch Curley hit 4-of-6 free throws and finished with 10 points.

Senior Chasity Gorman capped the run with Ganado leading 35-30 with 1:14 left in regulation.

Phoenix Christian made it one possession game when senior guard Mariah Leary converted an old-fashion three-point play with 52 seconds left as Leary led all scorers with 21 points.

Nevertheless, Ganado sealed the victory by connecting on four free throws. For the game Ganado hit 17-of-22 from the charity line.

""We shot too many threes and when they didn't go in (the Cougars) got rebounds and they made some shots in transition,"" Bitsuie said. ""I told them lets get in the bonus so that we can shoot free throws. We finally did that and I am so proud of them.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10153818474686233/?type=3,2016-02-26 23:13:41,852,21,115,823,20,9,0,0,0

GLENDALE, Ariz. – A new Division III girls champion will be crowned on Saturday night.

Window Rock's defensive performance powered the Lady Scouts to a 41-39 upset win over Page in Thursday's quarterfinal game at the Gila River Arena in Glendale, Ariz.

In other quarterfinal action, the No. 4 seed Chinle Lady Wildcats advanced with a 48-37 win over No. 5 Safford. Top seeded Chandler Valley Christian took care of Winslow, 57-47, while No. 3 seed Phoenix South Mountain defeated No. 6 Pueblo Magnet, 64-33.

In Friday's semifinals, No. 7 seed Window Rock will play South Mountain at 1:45 p.m. while Valley Christian and Chinle will square off at 5:15 p.m. The winners will advance into Saturday's championship game. Tipoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. in Glendale.

Window Rock held the defending state champions to 12-of-53 shooting, which included a 1-for-11 effort in the opening quarter. The Scouts also forced three early turnovers and converted them for points for a 12-2 advantage after one quarter of play.

""With our press we got them to turn it over at the start,"" Window Rock coach Mac Beach said. ""That got us clicking and that got everybody's confidence going.

""We worked together as a team and today that worked for us,"" he added.

The Scouts led from start to finish but they withstood a furious rally from Page as the Sand Devils cut an 11-point deficit down to 41-39 with 24 seconds on a putback from junior guard Ariel Austin. 

On Page's next possession, the Sand Devils had three different looks to either win it or send the game into overtime. Needless to say, junior post Kaitlynn Begay missed her three-point attempt and the two offensive boards Page collected fell to the wayside.

""We beat them in every statistical category except shooting,"" Page coach Justin Smith said. ""That is how we lost the game.""

Page senior Ashley Dempsey turned in a double-double performance with 12 points and 16 boards.

Window Rock, meanwhile, had senior post Alicia Hale finish with 10 points and 10 boards. Senior Triana Francis and sophomore Venessa James added nine and seven, respectively.

Beach said he's expecting another tough matchup with South Mountain and he's hoping they can stop shooting guard Najiyyah Pack from going ballistic.

""Tomorrow is going to be a different game,"" Beach said. ""We just have to make sure No. 30 (Pack) does not kill us.""

In the earlier game, the Wildcats held a good Safford squad to three points in the final quarter. That superb effort actually started in the third quarter as Chinle battled back from a seven-point deficit and tied the game at 34-all going into the fourth.

""We had a good first quarter and in the second and third we struggled a little bit,"" Chinle coach Pete Butler said, while adding that run in the third quarter changed the momentum of the game.

""They picked it up,"" he said. ""We pressured the ball more, we doubled team more and we got some good steals. Defense won the game tonight and that is the one thing we pride ourselves in.""

As a team Chinle finished with 15 steals with junior guard Nahatabaa Nacona collecting eight steals to go along with her 12 points and seven boards.

Junior Quannah Ryan added 10 points while seniors Kalli Hunter and Nikesha Eagleman helped out with nine points each.",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10153816490856233/?type=3,2016-02-26 00:28:38,2827,55,212,2750,41,25,6,5,0

GLENDALE, Ariz. – With a timeout to burn, Winslow coach Scott Corum gave Mingus Union Gerardo Angulo some time to think about his free throw attempt.

With three seconds left in regulation, Angulo had missed his first attempt of a two-foul shot that prompted Corum to sidetrack the Mingus Union post player.

That brief timeout seemed to work as Angulo's last attempt hit the back end of the rim as Winslow escaped with 50-49 victory in the quarterfinals of the Arizona Division III state playoffs at the Gila River Arena in Glendale, Ariz.

""We called a timeout to make him think about it,"" Corum said. ""We drew up a play just in case he made it. Unfortunately for him he missed but for us we secured the rebound.""

With the one-point victory, Winslow advances into the Final Four round and will play top seed Goodyear Estrella Foothills at 7 p.m. Friday night at the arena in Glendale. Estrella Foothills took care of No. 9 seed Yuma Cibola 69-55.

The winner advances in Saturday's 7:30 p.m. championship game.

After leading 13-10 at the close of the first stanza, Winslow put together its best quarter of the game by outscoring Mingus Union 15 to 7. Nate Hollins led Winslow's attack as the junior guard put in five of his eight points in that stanza with the Bulldogs leading 28-17 at the break.

That 11-point deficit did not faze the 22-8 Mingus team. The Marauders got three inside buckets from Angulo while teammates Fabian Navarro and Ashton Loring both hit two crucial treys to pull Mingus within 36-35 heading into the fourth.

The lead changed hands five times in that final quarter with Navarro pacing Mingus with five of his team-best 16 points.

His trey at the 0:49 mark earned Mingus a brief 49-48 lead.

The Bulldogs, however, got the eventual game-winning basket by senior guard Dalvin Benally with 21 seconds left. Benally hit a close range shot after teammate Akeem Foster dribbled through the top of the key and found Benally open for a shot.

Winslow hit two earlier buckets in that manner and erased a 44-40 deficit midway through the fourth quarter.

""We wanted to attack that zone and I think we were settling for too many threes,"" Corum said. ""Late in the game we started being aggressive and we dished out to the open guys.""

Corum was proud of the way his team held their composure as they turned in a gutsy performance.

""Things didn't go our way in the second half but we found a way to persevere,"" he said.

Junior guard Nathan Hanley led the Bulldogs with 16 points. Winslow also had Rory Billie, Hollins and Foster finish with eight.

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

TUBA CITY – Tuba City Unified School District schools will be closed tomorrow (Friday, Feb. 12) to take care of an apparent rodent infestation, according to Harold Begay, superintendent of schools at TCUSD.
In a letter written to parents today, Begay wrote that there is evidence of rodent harborage in various parts of school buildings district-wide. And as a result of these reports, the district is working with Coconino County Health Dept., Tuba City Regional Health Care Corp., and University Termite & Pest to clean up. 
The district had its first pest case last Wednesday, according to Cheryl Barlow, superintendent and board secretary.
Barlow said the district contacted Angie Maloney, environmental health director of the Arizona Division of Environmental Health Services, to do an inspection. Maloney, however, denied the district. 
""So we called (University Termite & Pest from Flagstaff),"" Barlow said. ""And they inspected every room in every building."" 
Begay said that the district is taking measures so that the pest control service, along with the maintenance and the custodial staff, will have the time tomorrow and the three-day weekend to thoroughly clean and remove any evidence of rodent harborage. 
Begay also said the County and TCRHCC are also assisting the pest control service in further inspection of school facilities to mitigate and to abate any evidence of pest and rodent infestation. 
""Plus, we're looking for any holes in the buildings,"" Barlow said. ""(Workers) will enclose those. And they're going to pull furniture away from the walls to check corners, vents, and outlets."" 
At Tuba City High School this evening, members of the staff were moving things away from the walls and cleaning up. 
""They'll be fumigating the building,"" receptionist Michelle Nutumya said as she disinfected office surfaces. 
Begay said pests and rodents though are nothing new. 
""It's always ongoing, different pest problems,"" Begay said. ""Especially with rodent droppings, which is a serious public health issue. We're not going to tolerate additional reporting or any (pest and rodent) evidence.""
""This isn't anything new,"" he continued. ""I just want to get it cleaned and stopped."" 
And there's a way to do that, which is pest control, but the district has to wait until school is out for the summer for preventative measures.
Schools within the TCUSD will resume on a normal schedule Tuesday, Feb. 16.",,status,,2016-02-12 00:02:35,244,33,96,244,0,0,0,0,0

By Quentin Jodie
Navajo Times

CHINLE - With an at large berth on the line, the Tuba City Warriors increased its chances of making the Division III state basketball tournament. 

The Warriors posted a huge 65-61 win over Holbrook in opening round of the sectional tournament at the Wildcat Den in Chinle on Wednesday. 

""We're on that bubble whether we make it or not but the big motivation was we had to come out, we had to execute and do what we needed to do,"" Tuba City coach Ryan Brown said. ""Fortunately, we did that. We showed up tonight and the defensive intensity was there.""

On the other side of the bracket, the Monument Valley Mustangs fell to Window Rock by 62-60 count on a last-second shot by junior Tyrese Brown. That basket by Brown may have cost MV's chances of making state as the Mustangs are on the outside looking in.

On Friday, Window Rock plays No. 2 seed Winslow at 5:15 p.m. while Tuba City will take on top seed Snowflake with the winner's advancing into Saturday's championship game. 

The state seating committee will release the state tournament bracket this weekend with the top 24 teams making state. 

""We're sitting at No. 29, but hopefully the other teams will lose down the stretch,"" Monument Valley coach Anderson Holiday said, while adding that they lost a few close games to some of the top teams in Division III. 

""These tough losses really took a toll on us,"" Holiday said. 

In Wednesday's contest the Mustangs got off to a great start with Royce Charley and Kane Parrish combining for 20 points in the opening quarter as the Mustangs led 20-14. 

Holiday said his club shot the ball very well by being patient on offense. In addition, he said his kids stuck to the game plan defensively. 

Despite turning the ball over six times in the next period, MV closed out the first half on a 7-2 run after Window Rock momentarily gained a 27-26 lead on a basket by senior post Myron Wauneka. 

In that run the Mustangs hit four free throws and got a three-point basket by Merwin Sullivan. 

After the break Window Rock capitalized on a few Mustang turnovers and regained the lead at 40-37 on a three-point shot by Casey Billy. Nonetheless, the Mustangs managed to tie the game at 42 all at the end of the third quarter. 

The game remained tight as both teams went back and forth before the Scouts opened a 57-50 advantage with 2:05 left in the game on a putback by Brown.

Window Rock coach Raul Mendoza said they gave up too many open looks but he felt they gave a better effort in the second half to gain that seven-point advantage late in the game.

""They shot the ball very well,"" he said of MV. ""Defense has been our strength all year but tonight we seemed like we were not ready to play defense. We became impatient."" 

The Scouts did receive a scare late in the game when MV's Mitch Hurley hit three consecutive treys and tied the game at 60-all with six seconds left in the game. Rather than call a timeout, Mendoza allowed his players to make the final call as Brown hit a baseline drive just as time expired.

""If we didn't get a good shot right off the back I was going to call a timeout,"" Mendoza. ""Fortunately, we did something right for once. We got the ball to the open man and made a layup.""

In the earlier game, the Warriors withstood a 19-point first half effort turned in by Holbrook's Abrian Dixon. Dixon scored 14 of those points in the opening quarter that earned his team a 17-16 lead. 

The Warriors, however, used a 15-0 run that started at the tail end of the first quarter into the second to gain a 31-22 halftime cushion. 

""We made some adjustments to how our game plan was set up,"" Brown said. ""We wanted to pressure the guards up on top. They were still getting some open looks whether we were in a zone or matching up.""

Nonetheless, Brown said they contested most of those shots as he eluded to Dixon's outburst.

""We knew that we needed to really watch where he was on the floor at all times,"" Brown said of Dickson. ""When we made that big push we were moving and being active on defensive, and we able to produce some points as well.""

Brown felt that Joey Mathias lifted the team offensively as a sophomore scored eight of his 17 points in that run. 

In the second half, the Warriors built a 46-36 lead with 2:36 left in the third quarter after Urijah Yazzie capped a 10-6 run. 

To their credit, Holbrook got within a few buckets in the fourth quarter, but Tuba City answered each run with a basket to regain the momentum. 

""They have the shooters and guards to make that push from time to time but we were able to get some stops and get the momentum going,"" Brown said. ""We were able to get that going late in that third and we were able to make a run for ourselves."" 

Davian Yazzie led with 21 points while Mathias had 17. For Holbrook Dixon finished with 27 points, which included 7 treys.",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10153786304046233/?type=3,2016-02-11 01:42:37,484,12,45,484,0,0,0,0,0

On Jan. 14, Window Rock Unified School District notified local parents through Facebook of an attempted child abduction that happened in Gallup on Tuesday. The Facebook post said it was reported that an older gentleman was trying to lure children in his white van at local bus stops. The post assured the public that the staff at the school, aware of the alert, would remain vigilant in ensuring the children's safety.

The school encouraged parents to discuss this topic with their children tonight.

On Jan. 12 at about 7 a.m. at a school bus stop in the area of the Cedar Hills Apartments, a white box van occupied by at least one male individual was seen attempting to entice a child into the vehicle according to Gallup officials. Witnesses said the man had a foreign accent. The nationality of the man is unknown at this time. The vehicle was last seen traveling east from Cedar Hills Drive turning south onto South Second Street.

Superintendent Lynette Michalski noted the distance of the school from Gallup, but said it was important to notify parents and the public anyway.

""We sent out that notice just to let our parents know. Keep a watchful eye,"" Michalski said.

Anyone with information is asked to notify local law enforcement if they see anything suspicious, or call Crime Stoppers in Gallup at 505-722-6161.

Both vehicles in photographs provided by the city matched the description given by the child, and were in the area during the time of the incident.

Nevertheless, the final three quarters played out in Navajo Pine's favor with the Warriors drawing within four points at the end of regulation.
""We started to play their game,"" Pino said of Tohatchi. ""They were turning us over and we let them back into the game.""
It didn't help that Alamo Navajo lost three starters to fouls and afterward Pino credited the bench for securing the win.
Alamo Navajo had four players finish in double figures with Ben Guerro leading the way with 22 points while Marcus Pino had 13. Shawntel Guerro and Jade Lomahitewa added 11 points apiece.
Late Friday night, To'hajiilee got by Tsé Yi' Gai in their half of the bracket to make the finals with a 61-52 victory.
""They played an awesome game,"" Secatero said of her squad. ""They came together and they worked as a team. That is what we are looking for every game. We want them to find that spark.""
The To'hajiilee coach felt that senior point guard Isaac Ignacio carried the team on his shoulders as he finished with 11 points and six assists.
""He took over the leadership role today,"" she said.
In addition, the Warriors got 14-point efforts from Jayshawn Guerro and
Tyrique Winstead while Trevor Platero added nine.

Monument Valley defeated Grants, 59-40, while the Cougars pulled away from Santa Fe Indian School in the fourth quarter and picked up a 57-45 win.
""We were in a zone (defense) the whole game and then we went man-to-man,"" Tohatchi coach Tanisha Bitsui said. ""Once we went full court it changed the momentum of the game and it was in our favor. We scored off their turnovers.""
Bitsui said she is looking forward to facing Monument Valley for the second time this season as her squad defeated the Lady Mustangs by 76-54 count on Jan. 2.
""They stayed with us in the first half,"" Bitsui said of MV in their last outing. ""In the second half the girls really stepped it up defensively and that was how we ran away with it.""

WINDOW ROCK -- With a couple winter storms in northern Arizona and western New Mexico, the Navajo Nation can expect snow and ice on roads and trails this week.

            According to information from the National Weather Service in Flagstaff and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), northern Arizona and western New Mexico will see two or more storms.

The first storm should escalate in the afternoon and continue until noontime on Wednesday. Areas above 6,000 feet are expected to receive moderate to heavy snowfall.

A colder storm is due to hit the area Wednesday night with periods of moderate to heavy snow lasting until Friday morning. Above 4,000 feet should get snowfall on Thursday night.

In Apache County, a winter weather advisory remains in effect until noon Wednesday and a winter storm watch also remains in effect from Wednesday evening through Friday afternoon. Heavy at times, snow will continue as the colder system moves into the area late Wednesday, and brings snowfall through midday Friday with accumulation of two to seven inches. Elevations above 7,000 feet will get more snow.

Areas of Navajo County and Coconino County have winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings in effect, with parts under hazardous weather outlooks likely to create hazardous driving conditions.

McKinley County could get between two and seven inches as a series of storms impact the area through Friday.

            San Juan County and Sandoval County could get two to six inches with locally higher amounts on west facing slopes and higher peaks. Snow accumulation is expected until Friday. Heaviest snowfall is expected above 6,500 feet.

By Quentin Jodie
Navajo Times

LS VEGAS, Nev. – A few variables needed to take place for Tuba City, Ariz., cowboy Aaron Tsinigine to win his first world title in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association ranks.
With a 4.1 run in the 10th round at the 2015 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nev., Tsinigine placed first in the final round of team roping competition with partner Ryan Motes to push his year-end total to $227,671. 
""Two or three things needed to go our way for me to be here,"" Tsinigine said. ""We needed to win the round, for starters. If I could have picked anyone to be here with me it'd be Ryan Motes, my partner and my best friend.""
In the final round of the 10-day event, world runner-up Jake Cooper finished sixth in the round as his partner, Kollin  Vonah,  legged up. They finished with a 9.6 run as that proved to be the difference for Tsinigine to win the world by a mere $2,685.
""This has been a dream since I was a kid,"" Tsinigine said. When I was growing up on the reservation I would have never dreamed of winning a world championship. Everything's coming true for me tonight.""

Special to the Times
Bill Donovan 

    WINDOW ROCK - This is the first day that Star Wars fans will be able to purchase the special edition Star Wars Pendleton blanket at the Navajo Nation Museum.
    Because of this, and only for two days, the museum is selling the blanket for $239.99 said Manuelito Wheeler, director of the museum.
    Wheeler said the museum has been receiving a lot of inquiries about the blanket so he expects sales will be brisk.
    The museum has 32 of the blankets in stock and Wheeler said the museum was able to acquire the blankets because of its special relationship with Lucasfilm that began when the museum worked with the studio to put out a version of the first movie in the Navajo language.

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

 
TUBA CITY – Leonard Haskie, a former chairman of the Navajo Nation and a former delegate of the 22nd Navajo Nation Council, died on Dec. 6 after a battle with cancer. He was 71.

It was after the tribe suspended Peter MacDonald Sr. as chairman that Haskie, originally from Sanostee, N.M., served as the interim chairman from March 10, 1989 to Jan. 15, 1991.

Haskie finished second to Peterson Zah in the 1990 election for the then newly created post of president of the Navajo Nation.

At that time, Zah defeated Haskie and Steve Darden by a 46-32 percent margin. Haskie-Darden had 16,354 votes.

In 1995, Haskie was hired at Gallup-McKinley County Schools to assume administrative oversight of construction, maintenance and operations, transportation, and food services.

 Last November, he was appointed delegate representing the communities of Beclabito, Cove, Gadííáhí/Tókǫ'í, Red Valley, Toadlena/Two Grey Hills, Tooh Haltsooi, and Tsé 'Ałnáozt'i'í.

Haskie was a civil engineer. He had a bachelor's and a master's in civil engineering. And for a number of years, he was a licensed engineer in Arizona, Utah, and in New Mexico.

Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye and Speaker LoRenzo Bates, along with the 23rd Navajo Nation Council, extended their condolences to Haskie's family.

""Today we learned that one of our former leaders, who had served both as a Navajo Nation Chairman and President, had passed away last night at Northern Navajo Medical Center in Shiprock, N.M.,"" Begaye said. ""Leonard Haskie was a person with a wealth of knowledge that he used to advance the Navajo Nation toward a better future. It was a pleasure to serve with Leonard Haskie during my time as a council delegate on the 22nd Navajo Nation Council.""

Stated Bates in a press release, ""On behalf of the Navajo Nation Council, I send my sincerest condolences to the wife, children, and family of Leonard Haskie, a highly respected and distinguished leader of our great Nation.""

Haskie was Ta'neeszahnii (Tangle Clan) and born for Táchii'nii (Red-Running-Into-The-Water People Clan). His maternal grandfathers are Tódích'íi'nii (Bitter Water Clan) and his paternal grandfathers are Naakai Dine'é (Mexican Clan).

A service is scheduled at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 9 at the Veterans Memorial Center in Sanostee.

147969681232_10153643222106233,"Chinle water delays Denny's grand opening
 
By Cindy Yurth
Tséyi' Bureau
 
CHINLE — Somebody should have warned them about the water.
Outside the brand new Denny's restaurant Sunday, the line was snaking through the parking lot and was almost out to the street as people eagerly waited to be among the first served at Chinle's first sit-down chain restaurant.
Inside, owner Romero Brown was trying to get ahold of NTUA and sweating bullets.
""We're supposed to open at 6,"" he said at about 5:30. ""NTUA is supposed to send a guy down to tell us the water is OK. But I haven't seen him yet.""
A management team from corporate who had come all the way from Denny's headquarters in South Carolina had taken one look at Chinle's infamous reddish-brown tap water and shut the opening down until they could be convinced it was potable.
""All we need is for someone to take a picture of this water and post it on Facebook,"" a manager said.
Apparently nobody told the team that that is just the color the water is in Chinle, stained by iron compounds from the red sandstone through which it filters into a deep well. Most Chinleites don't even wash their whites in it; they take them to laundromats in Gallup.
""I tried to tell them the people here are used to it,"" said Sarah Bitsui of Chinle, Brown's niece. ""This is their water. We've been drinking it all this time and we're still here.""
By 6 p.m., the line had lengthened to more than 130 people, the temperature had dropped to 30 degrees, the doors were still closed and the NTUA was nowhere in sight. Brown's son Darrell, lead manager for the restaurant, popped out to assure the crowd that in spite of ""technical difficulties,"" the restaurant would be open momentarily.
""We're freezing!"" shouted one woman. But Darrell Brown calmed the crowd, assuring them, ""We're here to serve you. We love this area. I love my Navajo people!""
""This is crazy,"" muttered T.J. of Chinle, who refused to give his last name. ""It's just like Best Buy in Farmington Thanksgiving night.""
Still, no one was going anywhere.
""We like cold,"" declared Wilhelmina Davis, the first person in line. ""I used to go all the way to Window Rock to eat at Denny's. No more of that again!""
For Anna Haskie of Nazlini, Ariz., eating at Denny's was almost a spiritual quest.
""I can't wait to eat in here,"" she said. ""My son was Denny. He passed on. So this is my way of honoring him.""
""We just want to see inside, look and eat,"" added Helen Mego.
""I want burgers!"" piped up little Belle DeVeaux, in line next to her.
Inside, the corporate management team played some icebreaker games with the staff to calm their nerves while they waited.
Brown had hired 80 people to work the new restaurant, the management crew having taken an 11-week training course and the wait staff training at Brown's other Denny's in St. Michael's. The Department of Workforce Services had come through with a grant to train the employees, and presented Brown with a plaque for creating so many new jobs on the Navajo Nation.
""I'm happy to have the job,"" said Phillarena Begay of Round Rock, Ariz., a hostess. ""I was a cashier at a convenience store, so this is a step up for me.""
It was a step in the opposite direction for chef Cody Rockwell, a culinary school graduate who used to work at a ritzy sushi place in Phoenix. But he was equally grateful to Brown for the job.
""I moved here to be with my girlfriend,"" he said. ""I guess I'm settling for diner food, but I'm happy to have a job in the kitchen. There aren't many jobs like this in Chinle.""
Finally, just before 7 — a long, cold hour after the doors were supposed to open — the NTUA guy arrived and gave the water his blessing. The doors swung open and the Browns stretched a length of broad red ribbon across the entrance.
But there was another technical glitch: The giant scissors wouldn't cut the ribbon.
""There's metal in this ribbon or something,"" muttered Darrell.
A woman in the crowd saved the day, volunteering her pocket knife. After a few seconds sawing at the ribbon, it finally succumbed, amid a heartfelt cheer from the shivering masses. Judging from the smiles as the hostesses seated the hungry, long-suffering families, it was all worth it.
Meanwhile, up the street at the Junction Restaurant, a privately owned diner that's probably Denny's main competition in Chinle, one might have suspected a quiet night since the whole town seemed to be at Denny's.
But the Junction was its usual lively self.
""It looks like about the typical crowd for this time of night,"" said cashier/hostess Carlelisha Burbank. She added that the restaurant didn't lose any employees to Denny's that she knows of.
""There's room for more restaurants in Chinle,"" she shrugged.
Maybe even more motels. Brown announced at a VIP luncheon earlier Sunday that he planned to open a motel behind the restaurant, similar to his Navajoland Inn and Suites behind his Denny's franchise in St. Michael's.
Former council delegate Andrew Simpson applauded the move.
""He's been talking about it for 12 years,"" he confided. ""Finally Chinle has a council delegate (Leonard Pete) who will push it through.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10153643222106233/?type=3,2015-11-29 22:57:26,1424,182,379,1424,0,0,0,0,0

By Cindy Yurth

Tséyi' Bureau

 

            WINDOW ROCK — In a press conference today, Arizona State Sen. Carlyle Begay (Dist. 7) announced he is switching parties.

            Begay, who has been criticized by some of his Democratic colleagues as being too chummy with the Republicans, crossed the aisle for good today, announcing he is becoming a member of the GOP. 

            In a video explaining the transition, Begay said he believes it's best for his poor, rural district that contains several Indian reservations, including part of Navajo.

            ""Our rural and Native American families are in crisis,"" Begay states in the video, citing unemployment rates up to 80 percent, decaying roads and bridges, lack of access to clean water, low high school graduations rates and high rates of suicide.

            ""This is not how our distinguished ancestors saw our future,"" Begay says. ""Change must happen now.""

            Begay continues he has come to the conclusion that the Republican Party is ""the party of progress, the party of opportunity, and, moving forward, my party.""

            Begay was appointed in 2013 to fill the unexpired term of Jack C. Jackson Jr. and then elected as a Democrat in 2014.

            Begay's colleague Rep. Albert Hale (D-Dist. 7) wished Begay well.
""All I can say is it's good that he's showing his true colors,"" Hale said. ""I hope that he can accomplish what we've been trying to accomplish for Native Americans all these years.""

PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. – The state's top seed in the Arizona Division V volleyball bracket put forth a dominant performance in the fifth and deciding set against No. 3 Tonopah Valley in the championship game on Saturday night.

The Pinon Lady Eagles put on a clinic and built a early 10-2 lead with senior middle hitter Raquel Archie putting down three of her 31 kills.

That eight-point cushion was the difference as Pinon picked up its first-ever state volleyball crown by outlasting the Lady Phoenix with a 26-24, 18-25, 25-19, 19-25, 15-7 win at the Prescott Valley Event Center.

""I told the girls that the last set was going to go fast,"" Pinon coach Nellie McCurtain said. ""We just needed a good start and then we had to finish it off.""

McCurtain said her team passed the ball exceptionally well, which gave them ample opportunities to put the ball away with Archie leading that department. Sophomore middle hitter Blie Tatianna helped out with six kills, including the game winner.

""I was real nervous but we won the game with a team effort,"" said Tatianna, who added that she was glad to help out the senior class with a championship trophy.

With the win the Eagles capped their season undefeated with  21-0 record albeit their record excludes regular season tournaments.

""I am just happy that we won state but I am a little sad that I'll be leaving the underclassmen after this year,"" said Archie.

Last week Council Delegate Leonard Tsosie wrote a letter critical of negative characterization of public officials on social media and suggested we should ban these activities.

Fundamentally I disagree, but I think his point should be acknowledged.

The type of activity we witness on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter can be overly negative or mean-spirited.

But the Internet and forms of social media are powerful new forms of communication and ones that have ramifications on the politics everywhere, including the Navajo Nation.

We see social movements across the planet ebb and flow through these technologies, from the Arab Spring, to Occupy, to Idle No More, to Black Lives Matter. This doesn't mean it's an ideal form of communication. But it is one of consequence.

For the Navajo Nation, it has become an important place for political discourse, linking people in and outside of the reservation to happenings in Window Rock.

It is wrong to call for prosecution of slanderers on Facebook and elsewhere. We are protected by a tradition of free speech that includes satire and making fun of public officials, even where these characterizations are untrue or skewed.

It may seem overly negative and at times unreasonable — and often these characterizations are Ðbut it's necessary in order to have robust political discourse.

It's the choice of the people to determine between what is true and what is just rumor or misinformation. We need to maintain a high standard of evidence before we believe everything we hear or are told.

You don't need Facebook to spread misinformation. You just need a press release officer. And almost every well-staffed Window Rock office has one.

Tséyi' Bureau

CHINLE — At hearings before the U.S. Senate's Indian Affairs Committee Wednesday, President Russell Begaye disputed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy's testimony that the EPA is continuing to supply hay and water to communities affected by the Aug. 5 Gold King Mine Spill.
""The EPA has abandoned us,"" Begaye told the committee. ""The water tanks are being pulled out. The feed for our livestock is no longer there.""
In earlier testimony, McCarthy had told the senators ""We are continuing to provide hay. The BIA has continued to supply water.""
Begaye, however, testified that the last time he had talked to McCarthy, she was unaware that the regional EPA office had suspended aid Aug. 21, after learning that the Navajo Nation EPA had declared the San Juan River safe for irrigation.
According to Begaye, McCarthy agreed to reinstate aid at that time, but only until this Friday. ""How convenient!"" Begaye said.
In other conflicting testimony, McCarthy said the EPA was continuing to work with the Navajo Nation to develop a long-term plan to deal with the contamination and the relationship between the tribe and feds was improving.

            Willie said with this year's election controversy, NACE was inspired to do something around the Navajo language.
            ""It influenced us to do something,"" he said. ""What we could do on our end was to encourage the language.""
            Rules of the event include having a group of at least five people, the skit must be done entirely in Navajo, it has to be five minutes long and the skit must be submitted to the judges before hand.
            Skits including coyote or winter stories will not be accepted, Willie said. He added that the season for those stories is gone.
            The event is free and participants will be judged on creativity, originality, use of the Navajo language, timing and the response from the audience.
            Willie said he is hoping to see people expand their thought and creativity while using the language.
            ""I think what we're going to get out of this is something political,"" he said, adding that he's already seen social media posts about possible skits that deal with the election.
            So far Willie said they only have two groups that have inquired about the event but he encourages everybody to come out and give it a try.
            ""Even if you don't speak Navajo still try to do the best of your ability,"" he said.
            The event will take place in front of NACE on Tuesday, Sept. 8 at 5:30 p.m.
            Skits can be summited on the day of the event starting at noon. For more information: (928) 871-4090",,status,,2015-09-08 10:48:41,95,6,11,95,0,0,0,0,0

By Cindy Yurth
Tséyi' Bureau
 
CHINLE — In spite of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency having given the green light to use the San Juan River for irrigation, President Russell Begaye on Monday issued a press release stating he had decided to keep the canals closed, based on a meeting with Shiprock area farmers last Thursday and a Shiprock Chapter resolution passed Sunday urging him not to open the headgates.
Begaye said in the release both the meeting and the resolution indicate farmers still have concerns about using the water, although farmers off the reservation have been using it for over a week and the Animals River upstream is open for boating and fishing.
""I'm glad the water samples indicate the water is safe for irrigation use but I remain concerned over the soil and sediment that lines our river bank,"" said President Begaye. ""Every time a heavy storm hits or the soil is disturbed it can recontaminate the water.""
The NNEPA will have final results from their soil samples this week.
Although the USEPA has released data indicating both the Animas and San Juan rivers are back to normal after an Aug. 5 mine wastewater spill the agency accidentally released from an abandoned mine above Silverton, Colo., Begaye blamed the feds for the continued closure.
""I am furious that the USEPA has placed the Navajo Nation into this position. Our farms will not last much longer without water and our resources are depleting,"" Begaye stated in the release.
The USEPA stopped delivering water and hay to affected ranchers Friday after releasing its latest findings, but Begaye said the tribe and the BIA will continue to assist.
He urged other chapters affected by the closure to pass resolutions on whether or not they approve of opening the headgates to the canals.

147969681232_10153457993001233,"Begaye to decide today on opening canals
 
By Cindy Yurth
Tséyi' Bureau
 
SHIPROCK — President Russell Begaye Friday morning was tracing the route of the Aug. 5 Gold King Mine waste spill with members of the Navajo Nation Council and a medicine man, blessing the rivers and trying to decide whether to open the San Juan River to irrigation.
An emotional seven-and-one-half-hour meeting with farmers in Shiprock Thursday night had provided little guidance. While most of the 35 or so people who spoke begged him to keep the river closed, a subsequent anonymous paper ballot favored opening it.
The canal system, however, is being flushed Friday — an eight-hour process that cleans the silt out in case Begaye decides to open the system.
The U.S. EPA, which has maintained the river is back to pre-spill levels of heavy metals, has announced it will stop delivering replacement water to Navajo farmers Friday, but Begaye said the tribe and the BIA will continue to try to supply water to all who need it until the canals are open.
The Navajo Nation EPA also announced Thursday their independent test results indicated the river is safe for irrigation — though not yet approved for livestock watering. But the vast majority of the farmers who spoke were unconvinced.
""I don't want my children to get sterile!"" cried one woman.
""Nobody wants to buy our corn!"" said another farmer.
""What's going to happen when people start dying?"" asked someone else.
Others questioned why the NNEPA wasn't releasing its test results, other than a vague graph that indicated a spike in contaminants while the plume flowed through and then a steep drop to normal levels over the next few days.
NNEPA Executive Director Donald Benn said the tribe was keeping the results secret because they might be used as evidence in the tribe's planned lawsuit against the USEPA. He said some of the results were very similar to the USEPA's but others were different.
Steve Austin of the Navajo Nation Water Quality Program's Shiprock office showed a graph indicating that even as the toxic plume flowed through the Navajo Nation on Aug. 8, there were no heavy metals that exceeded the Navajo Nation's standards for irrigation water. However, on Aug. 9, a storm around Aneth apparently stirred up some of the contaminants that had settled to the bottom of the river and, downstream from Shiprock, levels of aluminum and vanadium rose to levels slightly higher than the standards.
""They exceeded briefly and went away,"" Austin said, noting that the vanadium level went up by only 10 parts per billion.
But no amount of science seemed to convince the crowd of about 150 farmers that their water was safe, and in spite of Begaye's repeated iteration that the tribe would sue the USEPA for enough money to build alternative projects, some were still suspicious that the tribe and the federal government were somehow in cahoots.
""The way it sounds, the Navajo Nation is being bought by the EPA,"" said J.C. Begay, a farmer who says he has already lost two animals to dehydration. ""They need to do a lot more homework before they turn on that water.""",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10153457987581233/?type=3,2015-08-21 14:15:31,1023,99,468,1023,0,0,0,0,0

            WINDOW ROCK — A head-on collision occurred on Arizona Highway 264 near mile marker 465 causing a road closure indefinitely, according to a Ganado Fire Department official.

            The accident occurred around 3 p.m. within the two-lane at the top of the summit and has brought emergency response teams from Window Rock and the Western Agency, including a helicopter for emergency medical evacuation.

            According to Ganado Fire Chief Dwayne Woodie, Highway 264 between Window Rock and Ganado will be closed until further notice due to authorities conducting an investigation.

            ""We are relying on information from our people on scene at this time,"" said Woodie.

            He added that fire crews from Ganado and Window Rock along with medical response teams are on scene and will be there until their investigation is finished.

            The vehicles include a grey mini-van, which has rolled over, and a dark SUV.

            People traveling this route after work are encouraged to seek alternatives routes as traffic is backed up for emergency response teams responding to the accident, according to Navajo Nation Police Dispatch.

            According to the Navajo Police dispatch office in Window Rock, Sgt. Terry John is leading the investigation of the two vehicle accident.",,status,,2015-08-13 18:11:50,364,80,143,364,0,0,0,0,0

By Donovan Quintero 
Navajo Times

        SHIPROCK, N.M. - Despite the early morning prayer offerings given by Shiprock farmer Earl Yazzie - who has been farming since he was a toddler - to save his fields of corn, squash, melon and cantaloupe, it seems it won't be so.

       According to Shiprock Chapter president Duane ""Chili"" Yazzie, who is a farmer himself, the farm board made the decision to keep the irrigation closed for the remainder of the season. 

      ""You can't describe the extent of hurt that we've been thrown into,"" Yazzie said.

        During an Aug. 5 excavation conducted by the EPA at the Gold King Mine site, loose material gave way, spilling the contaminated water into Cement Creek, which feeds into the Animas River.

        The bad news is the initial spill was about three times larger than the early estimate of one million gallons.

        On Saturday the orange-colored Animas River merged with the San Juan River. On Monday afternoon, the color seems to have all but disappeared, looking more normal. 

        However, Yazzie said that despite it looking ""normal,"" the Navajo Nation continues to caution community members living along the river to not use it until further notice. 

        ""The heavy metals in the contaminants sink to the bottom of the river and are easily agitated when disturbed,"" Yazzie said. 

        The bad part is that this will stay like for a long time he added. 

        ""Don't use or touch it despite it looking normal,"" he said. 

         Earl and his wife Cheryle Yazzie, who will be celebrating their 39th wedding anniversary on Oct. 2, say all they pray for is for the river to heal. 

         ""People see us out here everyday. Hoeing away in the middle of the day and heat, sunburned,"" Yazzie said. ""It is a labor of love."" 

          ""Me and my wife Cheryle, we sell our crops and hand them out. We also donate some of it to the women's shelter here in Shiprock,"" he added.

          ""We had plans. We were going go make steamed corn and kneel down bread. Now this happens,"" said Cheryle. ""Looks like we aren't gonna have our steamed corn. You know what they say, 'you never make plans.'""",,video,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/videos/10153433057526233/,2015-08-10 18:56:02,2466,380,2848,2466,0,0,0,0,0

    DURANGO, Colo. -- Saying ""Cattle can't wait for test results,"" Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye Sunday called on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to bring drinking water for people and livestock to the Navajo Nation to replace San Juan River water contaminated by a three-million-gallon spill of toxic mine waste in Silverton the agency inadvertently caused when digging at an abandoned mine Wednesday.

     After attending a public meeting in Durango that included state and local government officials as well as EPA representatives, Begaye also reiterated his plans to sue the EPA and revealed the Navajo Nation has been taking its own water and sediment samples, which will be sent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for analysis.

     ""We're not going to depend on EPA,"" he said. ""We're going to get our own answers.""

     Begaye said three water tanks that draw from the San Juan in Farmington, Aneth and Mexican Hat, Utah have been shut off as well as irrigation ditches in the Shiprock area, and Navajos are hauling water for themselves and their livestock.

    ""Farmers are upset,"" he said.

     EPA officials at the meeting showed graphs of test results showing the major contaminants -- iron, manganese, zinc and cadmium -- had returned to baseline levels in the Animas River in the northern part of Durango by Sunday, after most of the toxic plume had passed, and acidity levels were back to normal.

     Colorado Parks and Wildlife reported only one of the 108 ""sentinel fish"" planted in cages in the river had died, and Scott Roberts, an aquatic ecologist with the independent Mountain Studies Institute said that soil samples from the river bottom, where the heavy metals are likely to settle as the plume flows downstream, contained live aquatic insects 20 hours after the plume had passed, which is a good sign.

      EPA officials said four settling ponds have been constructed at the Gold King Mine and the waste is being treated before it enters the river. The volume of the discharge has also decreased from 700 to 500 gallons per minute.

      The bad news is the initial spill was about three times larger than the early estimate of one million gallons.

       During an Aug. 5 excavation conducted by the EPA at the mine site, loose material gave way, spilling the contaminated water into Cement Creek, which feeds into the Animas River. 

       Test results from the river are available at epaosc.org/googling one.",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10153430494811233/?type=3,2015-08-10 00:46:13,792,66,374,792,0,0,0,0,0

147969681232_10153388789066233,"Navajo language referendum passes in special election

By Bill Donovan
Special to the Times

     WINDOW ROCK -  Navajo voters decided on Tuesday that it should be the Navajo people and not the Navajo courts who should decide whether a candidate running for tribal president or vice president is fluent in Navajo.
    A referendum to change existing tribal laws on that subject passed  Tuesday by a vote of 13,017 to 11,778, according to the unofficial count done by the Navajo Election Administration. That's a difference of about five percentage points.
    As expected, turnout for the election was low with only 21 percent of the registered voters participating in the election.
    The election count, which was done in the auditorium at the Navajo Nation Museum, showed the first chapter votes coming in just three minutes after the polls closed.  The tallies from the first seven chapters put the yes vote ahead but then about 7:05 p.m., the nays took the lead but that lasted only for about seven minutes as the yes vote took the lead again after 23 chapters and kept it to the end.
    Thomas Benallie, one of the 100 or so people who showed up to watch the count, said the decision by the Navajo voters was a good one because it gives more power to the Navajo voters and gives them a greater say in the running of their government.
    ""I don't think that the Navajo people will elect someone with no knowledge of Navajo culture or the Navajo language, but passage (of the referendum)  will allow more people to run for tribal president in the future.""
    Voter rights groups on the reservation spent a lot of time in the days before the election trying to explain what the new law would and would not do and clear up any misunderstanding that the Navajo voters may have had. One of these was that passage of the referendum would mean that future tribal leaders would not need to know anything about the Navajo language or culture.
    The requirement that candidates know both English and Navajo will still be on the books and it will now be up to the Navajo voters, and not the tribal courts, to decide whether the candidate is fluent enough in Navajo to properly represent the Navajo Nation.",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10153388789066233/?type=3,2015-07-22 00:41:35,1012,116,205,1012,0,0,0,0,0

Special to the Times

GALLUP, N.M. -- State police officials said Friday that the department's bomb squad was called to the Red Rock area, about four miles south of Gallup, on Monday to deal with a cache of dynamite that was discovered this past weekend at a Navajo Reservation house.
    Chad Pierce, the spokesman for the state police, said the bomb disposal unit picked up 30 sticks of dynamite that were discovered when the owner died and family members were sorting through the estate.
    The deceased, said Pierce, worked out of Fort Wingate, N.M. 
    The dynamite may have been more than 35 years old but was in stable condition.
    The dynamite was transported to Albuquerque and was destroyed.",,status,,2015-06-12 18:35:02,274,31,42,274,0,0,0,0,0

By Cindy Yurth
Tséyí' Bureau

 
Residents of Red Lake/Navajo Chapter will have a chance to celebrate their pets Saturday at the Diné bi Pet Carnival.
The event, starting at 10 a.m. at the old Recreation Center parking lot, will include informational booths, presentations, games and contests with prizes for the best pet trick, most obedient, etc.
All animals must be either on a leash or in a carrier.
Prestene Garnenez of the Red Lake/Navajo Community Action Group, which is sponsoring the event, said she started thinking about it when she saw all the starving dogs at the local convenience store.
""I know you're not supposed to, but I always buy a loaf of bread and feed them,"" she said. ""I just can't stand to see them like that.""
Then, for a while, ""I started taking them home and ended up with way too many dogs,"" she said.
Garnenez thinks she's typical of many in her community … soft-hearted, but not knowing what the resources are and how to take the best possible care of her pets without draining her savings account.
On the other hand, pet ownership is undeniably a happy experience, and she wants her community to celebrate the joy their pets bring to their lives.
""It's going to be a day of focusing on our pets,"" she said, ""a fun way to spend time with our pets and learn more about proper pet care.""
Unfortunately, after the group had already scheduled the event, they learned most Navajo Nation personnel won't work on weekends, so Animal Control and the other Navajo Nation departments that deal with pets won't be represented.
Non-profits like Blackhat Humane Society, however, will set up booths.
The event is free and open to everyone and every species, as long as they are properly restrained and not dangerous to others. Unhealthy animals who may be contagious should be kept home.",,status,,2015-06-12 16:49:07,121,7,20,121,0,0,0,0,0

By Cindy Yurth
Tséyi' Bureau
 
TSAILE — Seven students, former students and former employees of Diné College held protest signs reading ""End hostility, discrimination and restore harmony"" and ""Maggie George violates DC policies"" outside the Hatathlie Building as the college's board of regents met inside Friday morning.
The protest was patrolled by an almost equal number of security guards.
Regents walked by the protesters without acknowledging them, and in the meeting only one regent — Council Delegate Nelson BeGaye (Tsé Ch'izhi/Round Rock/Rock Point/Lukachukai/Tsaile-Wheatfields) mentioned them.
While discussing a Sihasin Fund grant for which the college recently applied, BeGaye observed, ""As I came in I saw protesters outside. There's a lot of negativity in the media. I've been getting a lot of calls from faculty members.""
BeGaye told the board the controversy could hurt the college's chances at the grant money and suggested the regents deal with the protesters' concerns.
Nobody picked up the topic, and the board moved ahead with its agenda, which was not distributed to members of the public attending the meeting and only read aloud into the minutes after Regent Theresa Hatathlie requested that.
George Joe, a former Diné College employee who has a complaint pending with the Office of Navajo Labor Relations for alleged unlawful termination, said the protesters' concerns are basically the same ones addressed in a petition signed by 38 faculty and staff: unqualified faculty members and administrators, preferential treatment for those who keep their mouths shut, and ""abuses and violations of policy.""
Asked why they were protesting at a board of regents meeting, Joe said the board has lost track of its role as a check against the administration and is allowing College President Maggie George ""free rein to do whatever she wants.""
Like the petition signers, the protesters want Fannie Atcitty, Loretta Draper and Laurence Gishey replaced on the board — Atcitty and Draper because they have served two years after their terms ended and Gishey because he does not live in the district he is representing.
""The board does not allow any of our complaints to be investigated or even acknowledged,"" Joe charged.
Asked if she is serving on an expired term, Draper replied, ""I can't comment on that right now.""
Joe also said he estimates the college has spent more than $150,000 in legal fees defending itself against 10 complaints filed at the ONLR over the last four years.
Student Jay Ross Slivers said he was motivated to join the protest after the reaction he got from a recent letter to the editor critical of the college brass.
""Some of the staff and even community members called me to say they agreed with me and told me their stories,"" he said. ""I'm really concerned that the college's reputation has started to go down.""
A security guard tried to dissuade a Navajo Times reporter from entering the BOR meeting, saying the regents ""don't want to be bothered right now,"" but relented when the reporter reminded him it was a public meeting.",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10153302795411233/?type=3,2015-06-12 16:28:45,363,41,81,363,0,0,0,0,0

9 school buses burn in Piñon
 
By Cindy Yurth
Tséyi' Bureau
 
PIÑON, Ariz. — Nine school buses were consumed by flames in a mysterious fire in the Piñon School District's transportation yard early Thursday morning.
According to District Superintendent Doug Vaughan, ""seven were destroyed, and two are severely damaged to the point that I don't feel comfortable putting children in them even after they're repaired.""
Vaughan estimated the loss at $1.4 million. The buses are insured.
The blaze is being investigated by the Navajo Nation Fire Department and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, with assistance from the Navajo County Sheriff's Department.
As bad as the fire was, it could have been an uncontrollable inferno if it had spread to the gasoline tanks located under the parking lot where the buses were parked.
Just last year, said PUSD Facilities Manager Myron McLaughlin, the district had poured a cement cap over the tanks for safety reasons.
Explained Vaughan, ""Fire can go through asphalt, but it stops at concrete.""
Vaughan said he was awakened at 12:30 a.m. by a call from a campus security guard.
""He told me a bus was on fire,"" Vaughan recalled. ""By the time I got there, three buses were on fire. The fire kept going down the line of buses.""
The loss, already almost a third of Piñon's fleet, could have been worse if not for some quick-thinking school employees who jumped in the unburned buses and drove them out of harm's way, Vaughan said.
""The employees, who are heroes in my book, literally risked their safety in order to evacuate the buses,"" Vaughan said.
The Navajo Nation Fire Department, Navajo Nation Police and Piñon Community School fire department all responded to the blaze, along with ""numerous volunteers who showed up on our doorstep asking how they could help,"" Vaughan said. ""Do you think we have a good community here?""
Summer school was canceled Thursday and Friday.
Vaughan said the district is already negotiating with a vendor to replace the buses, known in the industry as ""Thomas heavy-duty with the Colorado package."" They cost about $150,000 apiece.
""They are the most rugged buses you can find, which is what we need out here,"" Vaughan said. The first replacement bus is scheduled to arrive Monday, and Vaughan said the district is committed to being back to full fleet status by the time school starts in early August.
While the district is insured and can replace the buses, Vaughn said the children enrolled in summer school won't get back those two days.
""That's what really frosts me,"" he said.
Vaughan extended appreciation to the Navajo Nation Police and Fire departments, the Office of the Navajo Nation President (who immediately called to make sure no one was hurt in the blaze, Vaughan said), and the Navajo County Sheriff's Department.
""Whoever did this,"" said McLaughlin, surveying the gray, burnt-out hulks of the buses, ""the only people they're hurting are the children.""",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10153300696831233/?type=3,2015-06-11 18:13:06,1500,377,1042,1500,0,0,0,0,0

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau

     TUBA CITY – Bahe Ketchum, a member of an elite group of Marines who helped create the only unbroken code in modern military history, died Monday morning. He was 96.

     Ketchum, a Navajo Code Talker, was born Jan. 15, 1919 and lived in Naatsis'áán, Ariz. for more than 60 years. He is survived by nine sons and two daughters. His wife deceased in 2006.
     ""A lot of people looked at him as a community person,"" said his son, Marvin Ketchum in an interview with the Navajo Times on Monday afternoon. ""After the war, when he came back, he did a lot for the community (Naatsis'áán) as a chapter official and a representative.

     ""He did a lot for Shonto and Ts'ahbiikin chapters (as well),"" he added. 

     Upon discharge from the Marines, Ketchum returned home to north Western Navajo where he raised a family and maintained livestock.
 
     Marvin said his father suffered a number of injuries, falls that have sent him to the hospital within the last couple of months. After a recent surgery, Marvin said his father developed pneumonia. 

     Ketchum also leaves behind a lasting imprint on the Navajo Nation. 
     In 1955, Ketchum served as the Navajo Mountain Chapter vice president. He also served as the secretary-treasure from 1963 to 1975. In addition, Ketchum served as an archeological society guide and a community health representative. 

     Ketchum was Tł'ízíłání (Many Goats Clan) and born for the Tábąąhá (Water's Edge Clan). 

     There will be a meeting for Ketchum at Navajo Mountain Chapter tomorrow evening (June 9).

147969681232_10153222359231233,"BREAKING NEWS: Navajo Nation Chief Justice Herb Yazzie announced his retirement on Wednesday afternoon. Yazzie released the following statement:

""After forty years working in the legal profession for the Diné and with thirty years working in Navajo Nation government, with a stint as Attorney General and more recently as Chief Justice, I will be retiring. My retirement decision has long been urged by my family, relatives and community out of concern for my well-being. For the past ten years, I have been part of a Court that has had to make hard decisions often involving ruptures in relationships that, according to our deeply held principles of k'é, should properly be the responsibility of a better and more traditional system to patiently restore. I have decided now, with full consultation with my elders, to heed their advice.

Our society is a precious one, but one in which isolation and lack of self-esteem can harm our young ones their whole lives. I was such a young one, refusing to see value in myself, yet I survived though many of my generation did not make it and could not provide for the families they left behind. Somehow, I gained experience and knowledge, and was able to reconnect with my loved ones. It is much harder for a young person to reconnect after isolating himself or herself than to understand the value of relationships, k'é, from the beginning and be helped forward. Sometimes to learn this value, there must be a disciplinarian. I have tried to emphasize this value in my participation on the Supreme Court, Hashkééjí Nahatʹá, and by example.

We start with incomplete knowledge in a difficult environment. The difficulties in making ends meet is often unbearable enough and becoming separate from our value system, embodied by our language, can seem insignificant. We can become indoctrinated into believing such identity to be unimportant. Parents may even believe that they are protecting their child by affirming the unimportance of traditional knowledge that the parents, themselves, have not conveyed. To these parents, I would tell a story, that of a young Navajo serviceman troubled at putting on an army dress uniform with insignia of cavalry sabers, feeling a general sense of betraying himself, and unable to put into thought or words how to own his own future.

My folks always said – your experience, your knowledge, we appreciate you putting it to good use on behalf of the people. You now have attained these high leadership positions. But be aware that there will always be people who will insist on behaving as if the function of government is to destroy itself. In your position, don't ever get down to their level, because you have to protect the concept of natanii. You have to maintain integrity for the people, and you should not by your words cause people to lose faith in our value system or respect for the value system. That's not what a leader does. However, there have been a few times that, as part of the Supreme Court, I have had to call the government structure into question in order that the people have knowledge of your government, be engaged in the actions of government, and design and choose your future system of government that affirms who you are rather than merely imitate surrounding states. 

The other day, someone told me that he understands and supports the Supreme Court. He remembered that when the Council declared that Fundamental Law and tradition is only what the Council decreed Fundamental Law to be, it was the Supreme Court that struck down that effort. It was through use of Fundamental Law that the courts were able to rein in corruption in past Councils and strike down enactments that provided cover for embezzlement of the discretionary fund. Concern for the traditional law of the people and the value system of the people have been the duty of the court system since the Navajo Nation began performing decision-making functions free of the burden of elections. It is my steadfast hope that the Judicial Branch may continue to be the disciplinarian and gatekeeper without interference.

The Court takes a comprehensive look at the laws and hears the explanation from those who wish to state their position. The Court cannot ignore other laws, and it cannot pick and choose which law applies when there is a set of laws that all bear on one subject. In the recent election cases, our courts affirmed the rights of the people to choose their leaders. Yet at the same time, it was our elders, our former leaders, who made it very specific, very strong, that you must be fluent in order to be President and Vice President. Our government specifically added the fluency qualification in 1999. We affirmed the validity of the language requirement in our president election laws. We have noted that the President is nihi nanitʹaʹi elected by all the Navajo People while all other offices are elected by communities in smaller areas. The President has the stature of representing the whole Navajo Nation to other sovereigns and the one who is the embodiment of the Nation. The law requires this embodiment to be bilingual. Don't expect to be President without acquiring the qualification.

In closing, I would say that the recent proposed measure to remove me all concern decisions by the Supreme Court, not actions of an individual. The decisions were based on a thorough analysis of the law and declaration of how the law should be applied. Issuing court decisions that are thoroughly explained are manifestly judicial acts, that is what courts do. Our past governmental leaders have always said that when the Supreme Court makes a decision, that is the final decision. That law must be complied with no matter how some may view me as an individual. Seeking to use personal attack does not nullify the Court's decision. I urge the Diné to learn from the actions and words of those who attack our way of life. Learn and protect our heritage. Turn the negative into positive.

I am truly grateful for being able to have worked with all of you. I have become acquainted with many of you personally and know that I have family all over our land. In my retirement, I am sure we will meet and enjoy the beauty of our life and the gifts that have been bestowed on us.

Coming from being a judge, my dream is that when we meet those who find themselves facing harshness of life, that we will help them, especially affirm to the Diné that because we are Diné, we can restore ourselves to the Beauty Way, and thereby also affirm all humanity who are universally linked, as neighbors, as surrogate family, and as partners in a mutual journey.

I'm sure we will see each other soon.

By Bill Donovan
Special to the Times

 WINDOW ROCK - The White Cone Chapter is spearheading an effort to create a tribal constitution by holding a gathering of grassroots Navajos at the chapter's community building on Saturday.
 The event is set for 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and will be co-sponsored by Diné Biziil, a reservation-wide grassroots organization. Lunch will be provided.
 Norman Brown, co-founder of Diné Bizill, said that although there have been unsuccessful efforts in the past to develop a tribal constitution, all of which went nowhere, he feels that the efforts this time will be successful because of the recent election of Russell Begaye as tribal president.
 Brown pointed out that Begaye supported the creation of a tribal constitution during his campaign as a way to unify the Navajo people and bring stability to the tribal government.
 He said he wants this gathering Saturday to start the groundwork for the development of a constitution and get people talking about what they would want in it.
 After this gathering, the plans are to hold other gatherings in major communities on the Navajo reservation to continue getting input. There are also plans to hold a rally during the July tribal council session in which grassroots Navajos from all four directions will come in on horseback to urge members of the council to lend their support to the effort.
 Once a constitution is developed, Brown said the group plans to present it to the council and then to the Navajo people through a referendum.
 When asked how long this should take, Brown said he hopes to see a proposed constitution developed by the end of 2016 and final approval within four years.",,status,,2015-05-01 16:37:11,143,5,26,143,0,0,0,0,0

By Bill Donovan
Special to the Times

     WINDOW ROCK - If you went to Window Rock on Monday, you may have noticed that tribal offices were closed. The reason was that the tribe was celebrating its annual Sovereignty Day.
    The tribe has been celebrating it since 1986 to commemorate a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that affirmed the tribe's inherent power to tax.
    Former Navajo Tribal Chairman Peter MacDonald began the effort almost seven years before, declaring that all sovereign governments had the right to tax, and his successor, Peterson Zah, kept up the effort.
    The approval resulted in the tribe setting up a series of taxes -- possessory interest, business and gross receipts -- that provided the tribe tens of millions of dollars a year. Until today, the highest source of revenue for the Navajo Nation comes from its various taxes.
    Just how important is this to the tribal government? Since 1986, total tax revenues have far surpassed $1 billion.",,status,,2015-04-27 16:36:40,430,67,57,430,0,0,0,0,0

Shooter on loose in Fort Defiance area
 
Navajo Times Staff
 
            FORT DEFIANCE – Navajo Nation Police has reported an ""active shooter"" is on the loose in Fort Defiance and advises Black Rock Acres and Rio Puerco housing to take precaution and stay indoors.

            According to Deswood Tome, chief of staff to Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly, Navajo police received a call about a suspected shooter firing at a Navajo Tribal Utility Authority employee.

            The active shooter, male subject, is hiding out in the Rio Puerco housing area, Tome said, adding that residents at both Rio Puerco and Black Rock housing areas need to stay indoors.

            At approximately 1:25 p.m. Tome said, ""The police are down in this portion of the neighborhood. More backup is on their way.""

            That backup includes Navajo Criminal Investigations team, Crownpoint Police District, Window Rock Police District and Arizona Department of Public Safety.  In addition, the Navajo Nation Fire Department and security from the Window Rock Unified School District has diverted traffic.

            Tome said that Navajo Nation Police Captain Bobby Etsitty in charge of the scene.

            ""For everyone's safety and safety of the officers, they're calling more police in,"" he added. ""Nobody is hurt.""

            Law enforcement does have an idea of where the suspect is, but no exact location. ""They are not taking this lightly,"" Tome noted.

            No updates have been provided about the NTUA employee that was shot at by the suspect, according to Tome.

            According to Deenise Becenti, spokeswoman for NTUA, ""We're just allowing law enforcement to do their jobs.""

            Schools within the Window Rock Unified School District are also on lockdown, according to Window Rock High School Principal Donna Manuelito.

            Manuelito said the district got a call from Navajo police to go on lockdown at 12:13 p.m.

            This reported shooting in the Fort Defiance area is the second one to occur in the Navajo Nation this week.

            On Wednesday, Navajo Technical University in Crownpoint, N.M., was also on lockdown, after an armed student barricaded himself in the student housing on campus. No one was hurt in this incident, according to Shelly spokesman Rick Abasta.

            According to Navajo Times reporters Shondiin Silversmith and Stacy Thacker, who are in the field, traffic is currently being redirected at the intersection in Fort Defiance, with a few bystanders looking on.

            The reporters noted that over ten police units are on the scene, with police moving in on the subject in both housing areas.

            For more on this story, stay tune.

CHINLE — A suspect in a domestic violence incident and one police officer are dead with another officer seriously injured after an armed confrontation in Red Valley Thursday night.

According to President Ben Shelly's spokesman, Rick Abasta, Shiprock police were called to the scene of a domestic violence incident in Littlewater, N.M., about 4 p.m. A single officer responded and found a male holding his family hostage with a AR-15 assault rifle.

The suspect, tentatively identified as Justin Fowler, 24, shot at the officer, ""but the officer was able to take cover and was not injured,"" said Shelly's chief of staff, Deswood Tome. Family members also were not injured in the incident.
The officer called for backup and police from the Window Rock and Crownpoint stations, as well as more Shiprock officers responded.

The suspect, whom Abasta said was wearing a bulletproof vest, fled the scene in a silver Ford SUV heading west toward Red Valley. At least 18 police vehicles were involved in the chase, according to a witness in Red Valley.

About 10 p.m., ""They caught up to him as he was about to head over Buffalo Pass,"" Tome reported. Gunfire was exchanged, resulting in the death of the suspect and one officer. A second officer was transported to Shiprock Hospital.
Tome said the weapon used was of a type usually carried by police rather than civilians.

""We don't know where he got it,"" he said.

The names of the officers were not immediately available. Tome said they were both male and from the Shiprock unit.",,status,,2015-03-20 00:02:47,1747,459,1336,1747,0,0,0,0,0

By Navajo Times Staff

WINDOW ROCK — The Navajo people will get a chance to decide for themselves just how important it is for their tribal president and vice president to be fluent in the Navajo language.

Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly signed into law Monday a bill approved by the Navajo Nation Council on Friday calling for a referendum.

The call for a referendum came from Council Delegate Leonard Tsosie who said that this was a decision that should rest with the Navajo voter and not the council or the tribal courts.

Shelly agreed with this, saying that ""I maintain  that the Navajo people are the governing authority.""

Shelly's approval on Monday also allocates $317,891 from the tribe's undesignated reserves to pay for the referendum.

The big question now is how that will affect the upcoming special election for tribal president.

Edison Wauneka, the director of the tribe's election office, said Monday that the council's push for a referendum puts him once again in the middle of a fight between the council and the Navajo Supreme Court which has ruled several times that the special election for tribal president must be held as soon as possible between Joe Shirley Jr. and Russell Begaye.

The big question now is just when the referendum will be held.

Will it be held before the special election and if so would the outcome of the special election affect who would run in the special election? Or will the court continue to order a special election only between Shirley and Begaye?

The answer to this may come later this week when Hank Whitethorne and Dale Tsosie, the two former candidate for tribal president who filed the original challenge that removed Chris Deschene from the ballot, file an expected motion before the supreme court to get the court to force the election office to move forward on plans to hold the special election on April 21.

Navajo Times

 

            RIO RANCHO, N.M. – With contributions from nearly everyone, the Laguna-Acoma Hawks advanced into the finals of the New Mexico Class 3A state boys basketball tournament.

            Laguna-Acoma will play top seed Las Cruces Mesilla Valley on Saturday at 10:00 a.m. at the famed Pit on the University of New Mexico campus.

            In Thursday night's win, the Hawks had seven players score with five starters reaching double figures headed by the 24-point effort turned in by senior Ryan Arkie.

            Arkie, who also had four steals and three assists, felt that his team got a much-needed lift from the crowd as Laguna-Acoma took down the Clayton Yellowjackets, the tournament's No. 2 seed, with a resounding 89-72 win on Thursday night at the Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho, N.M.

            ""It motivates us,"" Arkie said of the electric atmosphere. ""The louder the crowd the better we play."" 

            The crowd got even louder when the Hawks opened the fourth quarter on a 10-0 run thanks to their suffocating defense as they extended a three-point advantage into a 67-54 cushion with 5:40 to play.

            ""We weren't having trouble scoring but we weren't stopping them so the focal point had to improve defensively,"" Peil said of the adjustments they made. ""Usually our defense creates a lot of our offense so when we're creating stops and rebounding we can get out and run.

            Peil said his team also did a good job of moving the ball on the offensive end.

            ""We started attacking the middle of their zone and we got some good ball reversals so we got some open looks,"" he said.

            Laguna-Acoma guard Jalen Smith was one of the recipients that benefited from that scheme as he finished with 21 points, which was more than his average.

            ""Every dish that I got I had to put up because I was wide open,"" Smith said. ""I felt that nobody could stop me.""

            The Hawks also got 13 points from David McGee while Kameron Joe and Matt Sanchez added 11 and 10, respectively.

            Going into their match with Clayton, Peil said they wanted to run the ball and wear the Yellowjackets out since they don't sub that much. 

            ""They did more of that tonight than they did  in the past,"" Peil said of Clayton going seven deep.

            Clayton coach Jon Leal said his boys battled hard but they got into foul trouble early.

            ""We didn't have a lot of depth this year,"" Leal said. ""But hat's off to Laguna. They are a well-coached team and they came to play tonight. They were the better team tonight.""

            Leal said with an uptempo game they had more turnovers than usually but he did acknowledged the discrepancy in the number of fouls called as his team was whistled 22 times while Laguna-Acoma had nine infractions.

            ""The key stat that I saw was they went to the line 29 times and we had five attempts all game,"" Leal said. ""There was a lot fouling but I really don't know what to think about that.""

            Mark Craine led Clayton with 21 points while Koy Geary finished with 14 and Jorge Leos added 13.

Navajo Times

 

ALBUQUERQUE – For the first time, in a long time, the city of Gallup, N.M., will be a ghost town.

The Gallup High School boys and girls basketball teams have made it to the New Mexico Class 5A basketball finals.

The No. 1 seeded Lady Bengals will meet No. 2 Los Lunas at 7:30 p.m. today, at The Pit for their final game of the season.

The No. 2 Bengals will meet No. 1 Centennial tomorrow for a 2 p.m. game also at The Pit.

Gallup girls got past No. 4 Espanola Valley in the semifinals on Thursday, defeating them 78-51.

The Lady Bengals have been traveling back and forth to and from Gallup to play in the state tournament this week and yesterday it played a factor in the first quarter of their game.

Gallup head coach Kamau Turner said his team wasn't quite ready going into the game.

""They had to wake up, they had to come, they had to play and that's what they finally did in the second quarter,"" he said.

At the end of the first quarter Espanola Valley led the Lady Bengals 16-13. In the second quarter, Gallup went on an 11-0 run and never looked back.

Turner said if his team continues to play disciplined they'll be ready to go against Los Lunas.

In light of remarks made by Los Lunas coach Marty Zeller, who publically stated that Gallup should not have had the No. 1 seed, Turner said it will all be resolved this evening.

""That's fine for them, whatever they want. Tomorrow (today) we both get a chance to prove it,"" he said. ""We're going to come, we're going to get to work and give them our best shots – I want to bring a state championship for these kids.""

 

Gallup Boys

 

The Gallup boys made history yesterday by being the third team to make it to state finals. 

The Bengals came in runner up in the 1930s and recently in 2012, under now head coach Domonic Romero. 

They earned their third ticket in history when they defeated No. 6 Grants High School 70-36 in the semifinal yesterday.

Romero said his team had the right start to finish the win.

""We got to get an early start. That was one of our goals that we wrote on the board, we can't come out with sluggish legs,"" he said. ""Right from the get go we got off to a good start like we wanted to, so I think that was the deciding factor.""

The Bengals had a small 8-5 lead over Grants at the end of the first quarter.

A few runs in the second quarter put them ahead 29-14 at the half. The rest was history.

Romero said he and the team are ecstatic to be back in the finals.

""When I first got hired seven years ago my goal was I wanted to take Native American kids and put them in The Pit,"" he said. ""We had a group of kids and I said 'how many of you guys have ever been to The Pit?' They had no idea what it looked like.""",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10153085269646233/?type=3,2015-03-13 11:49:04,1506,60,134,1506,0,0,0,0,0

Western Agency Bureau

KAYENTA, Ariz. – It took only eight rounds, but fifth-grader Kelvin Winney won the Navajo Times' Navajo Nation Spelling Bee on Thursday afternoon. 

Keeping an eye on his family, the 10-year-old took home the championship with the word ""virtuosa,"" meaning ""a girl or woman who is a virtuoso – an experimenter or investigator, especially in the arts and sciences,"" according to the Merriam-Webster's dictionary. 

The crowd's clapping and cheers created a roar inside the Monument Valley High auditorium when Winney, from Canyon De Chelly Elementary, was declared the champion. 

So what does it take to win the Navajo Nation Spelling Bee? On one hand, Winney says it takes courage. 

""Just the feeling of all these people and what you've to do, it's kind of hard for some people to understand that,"" he said. 

His mother, Nora, on the other says she's exhilarated by his win. 

""He's been studying,"" she said. ""It's great that he won. Every time he went up (to the microphone), we (as a family) were scared for him."" 

""We practiced with him and we encouraged him,"" she added. ""We always told him, 'Participation is good.'"" 

Winney walked away at the end of the day with a number of prizes including an Apple iPad mini, Webster's Third New International Dictionary, and an all-expense paid trip to the 2015 Scripps National Spelling Bee contest in National Harbor, Md. at the end of May. The trip is paid for by the Navajo Times.

            ALBUQUERQUE – Everything from a last-second shot to a defensive battle is what led three local boy'sbasketball teams to advance into the semifinals of the New Mexico state basketball tournament.

            The Gallup High School Bengals, the Grants High School Pirates and the Laguna Acoma High School Hawkswill play in today's semifinals for a chance to advance into Saturday's finals held at the WisePies Arena on the University of New Mexico campus.

            The No. 2 seeded Bengals defeated No. 7 Farmington High School in the quarterfinals on Wednesday with junior Colton Lowley hitting the game winning basket just as time expired for an exciting 61-59 win.

            The Bengals is scheduled to play No. 6 Grants at 3 p.m. today at the WisePiesArena (The Pit). Grants upset No. 3 Roswell in the quarterfinals with a76-71 victory.

            In their fourth meeting this season, Gallup played the Cinderella role to advance.

            The Bengals couldn't buy a basket for three quarters, but in the fourth stanza they came back from a 24-point deficit and hit a shot in the paint at the buzzer.

            Gallup head coach Domonic Romero said his boys had the fire lit underneath them.

            ""Farmington kicked our butts all three quarters and I think we played one good, great fourth quarter,""he said. ""When you have a fight to not give up, it's tough to stop us. That game was 100 percent on the players.""

            In Class 2A, the No. 3 Laguna Acoma Hawks defeated No. 6 Texico High School, 60-55, in the quarterfinals.The Hawks are scheduled to meet No. 2 Clayton in today's semifinals. Tip off is at 6:30p.m. at the Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho, N.M.

            The Hawks got off to a good start but they only scored five points in the second and trialed 28-24 at the half.

            Laguna Acoma head coach Ryan Peil said his team turned up the notch on defense, which clinched them the win.

            He said they were down by seven points and they turned it around, which lead to a 12-point  lead.

            ""That's an 18-point stretch where we really played good defense,"" he said. ""We forced them to take a lot of bad shots, we got out and ran better, and got some transition shots, and that makes all the different for us.""

            The boy's teams whose seasons were cut short were Farmington and Kirtland Central High School.

            Farmington had a stellar start in their game with Gallup but fell short in the final quarter.

            Farmington head coach Paul Corley said there were a number of factors that played into their loss at theend.

            ""I take a lot of blame for what happened there at the end,"" he said. ""I should have done a better job of coaching, that's what it comes down to there at the end.Their pressure and their couple (of) 1,000 fans really got this place rocking.""

            Farmington ended their season 20-10 overall.

            No. 8 Kirtland Central fell to No. 1Hope Christian 77-58 in the quarterfinals.

            Kirtland Central head coach Brian Dowdysaid his team was confident but mental fatigue set in and it got the best of them.

            ""Even last night, this morning, we felt good about the matchup,"" he said. ""We didn't execute theway we wanted to. The boys weren't afraid though.""

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – The Gallup High School Lady Bengals and the Shiprock High School Lady Chiefs are two games away from a blue trophy.
Gallup and Shiprock both survived the quarterfinals of the New Mexico high school state basketball championships on March 10.
They are the only area girl's teams left in the tournament.
No. 3 Shiprock defeated No. 6 Sandia Prep 61-50. They will meet No. 2 Hope Christian at 11:30 a.m., tomorrow at the University of New Mexico Wise Pies Arena (The Pit).
Shiprock head coach Larenson Henderson said both teams seek vengeance for different reason. 
The Lady Chiefs defeated Hope last year in the semifinals of the tournament but came up short to Portales in the finals.
""Hope is really looking forward to it, I know that,"" Henderson said. ""Last year we gave them a good number ahead of them and I think they want some revenge, and right now my girls feel the same way; we want some Hope right now.""
Shiprock struggled with their offensive game against Sandia Prep, shooting 1 for 21 behind the arch and 18 for 52 in field goals.
Their inability to light up the scoreboard resulted in a close first half with Sandia Prep. At the half the Lady Chiefs led 24-23.
The two teams were tied up at the end of the third at 40 points apiece. Shiprock managed a 10-0 run to start the final quarter and managed to keep the lead before closing in on the Sundevils. 
Henderson said knowing his team could pull together for the tough win made it that much sweeter.
""To have something like that and still pull off a win…I'm even more happy,"" he said.
No. 1 seed Gallup defeated No. 9 Belen High School 76-33 and will meet No. 4 Espanola Valley in the semifinals tomorrow at 1:15 p.m., also at The Pit.
In typical Lady-Bengal fashion, Gallup got off to a running start on Belen and led 27-7 at the end of the first quarter. 
They allowed Belen to outscore them 13-12 in the second quarter, but Gallup head coach Kamau Turner said his team managed to gather themselves.
""Overall you can't be mad. It's survive and advance, and that's ultimately what we want to do,"" he said. ""The second quarter we had a little turbulent time where we forgot that we needed to play defense, but the girls came out in the third and they picked it up and made up for it.""
Here is a look at the other local teams that were not as fortunate to advance to the semifinals.
In Class 4A, Kirtland Central High School and Santa Fe Indian School fell short.
The No. 5 Lady Broncos were defeated by No. 4 St. Michael's 45-37. No. 2 Hope Christian defeated the No. 7 Lady Braves 47-35.
The No. 6 Tohatchi High School Lady Cougars and No. 7Laguna Acoma High School Lady Hawks both came up short in the Class 3A bracket.
No. 3 Eunice defeated Tohatchi 56-54. No. 2 Texico defeated Laguna Acoma 43-29.
In Class 2A, No. 2 Melrose High School defeated No. 7 Ramah High School 59-38. No. 5 Magdalena High School upset No. 4 Jemez Valley High School 64-63.

The selections were made and released yesterday morning and late last night by the New Mexico Activities Association.
The association was supposed to release the seed selections on March 1, but was pushed back as some district title games were rescheduled to early this week due to inclement weather last weekend.

CHINLE, Ariz. and NASCHITTI, N.M. — Schools were closed across much of the Navajo Nation Monday after an all-day snowstorm on Saturday that dumped as much as two feet of snow in the higher elevations, followed by warmer temperatures and rain on Sunday which melted the snow and made dirt roads into a muddy, slushy mess. And according to the National Weather Service, it's not over yet.
At least one Navajo Nation Council delegate has said she will ask President Ben Shelly to declare a state of emergency.
Robert Kirk, principal hydrologist with the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources, said crews were still out gathering data from precipitation gauges Monday morning, but he could conclude from his own experience — including getting stuck in the mud in Rock Point, Ariz., on his way to work — that ""parts of the reservation got significant amounts of much-needed moisture over the weekend.""
Kirk said the department will put together a report on the storm and its impact on the ongoing drought by the end of the week.
Meanwhile, the lower elevations of the Navajo Nation were experiencing high winds Monday in advance of a cold front moving west to east that could dump another six inches in the Chuskas and 0.1 to 2 inches on the flats, according to the website of the National Weather Service's Flagstaff office.
An employee of the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management who hung up when asked for his name said Monday the office had received no reports of stranded families needing help, but in Tse AlNaoztii Chapter, officials reported at least five instances of stranded motorists.
At least 6 inches of snow fell in the chapter over the weekend that has since soaked into the ground and turned into mud. At the base of the Chuskas, Gerald Henderson, president of Tse AlNaoztii ALERT, said there was over 8 inches of snow. 
""As of yesterday, we are the chapter that got hit the hardest within the base of the mountain,"" Henderson said, noting that he's gotten calls from people who are stranded or got stuck in the mud.
 Last night, Henderson, members of the ALERT team as well as other volunteers, were out rescuing individuals from their vehicles at 1 a.m. Five vehicles were stuck, he noted. 
As a result of the treacherous conditions, the chapter will declare an emergency. So far, the chapter has been working with the American Red Cross to a set up a shelter, where it housed two elderly people last night. 
""Everything is just melting and creating a lot of mud,"" Henderson said. ""At the base of the mountain there is still snow.""
As of this morning, Council delegate Amber Crotty said she's working with officials in Window Rock, including Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly and the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management, to see if a declaration of emergency can be ordered Navajo Nation-wide.
""The chapter opened up the chapterhouse for those who are stranded, and are working with the American Red Cross,"" Crotty said. ""They're helping people out of the mud.""
Crotty also said ALERT officials have told her constituents there are out of wood, coal or other energy resources to keep warm.
""It's not  just our chapters on this side of the mountains, but on the other side like near Kayenta,"" Crotty said.
Declaring a state of an emergency, Crotty said, would help chapters and the Nation access emergency funding to help meet the needs of the people.
At a planning meeting Sunday in Two Grey Hills Chapter, Crotty heard reports of 18 inches there and at the mid-mountain level close to two feet of snow.
""No one is going out there with a ruler, but it's one of the biggest snowfalls in recent years,"" Crotty added. 
Now that the snow has melted into mud, the conditions most have to face now is mud. It's the reason schools in Naschitti and Newcomb, as well as Navajo Head Start cancelled classes for the day.
Melvin Stevens, president for the Naschitti Community Governance ALERT, said the Naschitti area is not has bad as in surrounding chapters — other than for those who live in the Fence Mesa area, which is mostly grass lands with clay and the Chuskas. Central Naschitti,where the chapter and NHA subdivisions are located is passable, with the BIA bus routes being muddy.  
Stevens said that about five familes live in the foothills, while another five live further up or half-way up the mountain, where snow is at least one foot.
One of those individuals living in the mountains is Freddie Wilson, who is in his mid-70s.
""Freddie is the only one up in the mountains,"" said Stevens, who knows this from the ALERT's assessment of families in the area. ""He's the only one that stays up there year round. He's been doing that for years and I guess he's accustomed to the weather.""
The ALERT president added that the chapter is ""mud-bog down"" just like other chapters of the reservation.
""The mud factor will probably be the worst, just based off of talking to people from those areas,"" he added.

CHINLE — As rain and snow continued to pelt the Navajo Nation Monday, the Department of Emergency Management established an emergency operations center in response to the numerous weather-related requests for assistance from the chapters, according to an email to emergency personnel in the chapters from Rosalita M. Whitehair, director of the department.
In the email, Whitehair urged the chapters to fill out an incident report form for each occurrence, so the DEM can evaluate the situation and send aid to the most critical areas. The form can be filled out electronically or printed out and faxed in.
The phone number for the EOC is 505-371-8415.
""We have DEM staff out in the field conducting assessments,"" Whitehair wrote. ""Please continue to keep us updated.""
Whitehair said the DEM is working closely with the community health representatives to identify high-risk populations and the Navajo Department of Transportation, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority and the BIA to maintain important roadways and power systems.
""Please remind our communities that heavy equipment will sink and make matters worse,"" Whitehair wrote. ""The best thing to do is to wait for the mud to dry.""
Whitehair suggested checking on the elderly or high-risk families early in the morning while the ground is still frozen.
The DEM is also receiving requests for help from chapter personnel who do not know how to write an emergency declaration, Whitehair reported. The DEM can forward these chapters emergency declarations from other chapters to use as models.
The DEM is preparing a spreadsheet of current conditions, actions taken and needs ""and will do the best we can to keep you all updated,"" Whitehair wrote, adding ""Please track all costs.""",,status,,2015-03-02 22:30:04,403,46,61,403,0,0,0,0,0

            PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. – The Valley girls basketball team had a few things go against them in their pursuit for its first state championship.

            The Pirates could not overcome a slow start as they dropped a 67-61 decision to No. 8 seed Phoenix Christian in the Division III girls final at the Prescott Valley Events Center in Prescott Valley, Ariz.

            ""We had too many turnovers and we did not shoot enough,"" Valley coach Julia Six said. ""Every time we got the ball we turned it over. I think if we took control of the ball we could have put up more shots.""

            Six also cited poor free throwing shooting as a factor in their six-point loss as they connected on 13-of-27 from the charity line.

            ""If we made six of those it would have been a tied game,"" she said. ""After that it could have been anybody's game.""

            It also didn't help that Latisha Nastacio, Cherelle Speen and Terri Mitchell received their fourth infraction in a 52-second span at the end of the third quarter.

            For the most part those three players helped Valley trim a 47-32 deficit down to single digits heading into the fourth with Nastacio and Speen flustering Phoenix Christian with their defense while Mitchell added a couple of long range shots.

            ""That made a difference,"" Six said, as Nasticio and Speen eventually fouled out. ""Playing defense with four fouls is tough.""

            The Pirates got as close a 53-50 on a three-point shot from Mitchell with six minutes left but Phoenix Christian got a little breathing run behind an 7-0 run from senior Dinah Watson.

            Watson scored two quick baskets in transition and she capped the run with a trey with 5:06 to go.

            ""We weren't getting back,"" Six said. ""We didn't find her on defense and she killed us.""

            Watson finished the game with 28 points.

            For Valley, Tamara Nez finished with 17 points while Mitchell added 14 and Nastacio chipped in with 13.

            GLENDALE, Ariz. – It wasn't easy, but the Page girls basketball team collected its fourth state title, the second under head coach Justin Smith on Saturday night.

            The Sand Devils chipped away a 10-point deficit in the second half and rode out that momentum to score a hard-fought 56-42 victory over league rival Tuba City at the Gila River Arena in Glendale, Ariz.

             The Sand Devils put their depth on display with sophomore guard Natasha Henry scoring the first five points of the half before junior Ashley Dempsey and senior Amber Sloan combined for eight points as Page trailed 36-34 after three quarters.

            In the fourth, Page got a big boost from Dempsey as she two treys with her second one spearheading a game-ending 13-2 run.

            ""I was really nervous but once we started to go on that run I knew that it was ours to win, "" Smith said. ""Everyone did what they were supposed to do. We got some big shots from different girls and I thought Ashley Dempsey's three-point shot was huge.""

            Sloan led Page with 23 points, including 12 in the second half.

            ""I just tried to help my team out,"" said Sloan about her production, which included a 16-of-18 effort at the charity line.

            ""It feels amazing and there is no words to describe it,"" she said of closing out her year on a high note. ""It's a relief that we won but it's nice to know that our hard work paid off.""

            For Tuba City, senior Tate Tsingine finished the game with a double-double, scoring 23 points and grabbing 10 boards.

By Quentin Jodie

Navajo Times

 

            GLENDALE, Ariz. – The Tuba City Lady Warriors are acquiring a taste for knocking people down.

            On Friday night, the Lady Warriors made it two in row as they reeled off the last 10 points to pull off an exciting 56-49 win over the Safford Lady Bulldogs at the Gila River Arena in Glendale Ariz.

            The Warriors looked to be down on their luck when Safford, the tournament's No. 4 seed, took a 49-46 lead with 2:52 to go on a lay-up by sophomore guard Crystal Hasse.

            But instead of buckling the Warriors got two straight buckets from an unlikely source as senior Samytha Parrish put in four of her 13 points.

            Earlier in the quarter, the Tuba City post got hurt when she got tangled with a Safford player while grabbing for a rebound.

            ""She's one of the toughest ones we have and no one is going to take her out of the game, and not on a foul like that,"" Tuba City co-head coach Kim Williams, said of Parrish. ""Her desire to win and to be a good teammate says a lot about her character. That's how she is.""

            Parrish got her arm twisted in awkward way with seven minutes left in the game. She lay on the court for a few minutes in obvious pain before the athletic trainer whisked her away.

            Needless to say, she returned to the game with a chip on her shoulder.

            ""I'm a senior and I didn't want to lose this game,"" Parrish said, ""so I felt like I had to step up.""

            Down the stretch, the Warriors iced the game by knocking down 4-of-4 free throws.

            In addition to Parrish, the Warriors got 15 points from sophomore forward Keisha Classay.

            ""I never count my team out, they always find a way to come back,"" Williams said when asked if there was any hint of doubt when they were down three points. ""I have seven seniors on this team and they want this more than ever before.""

            With the win the Warriors move into the Saturday's championship game with Page, which defeated Winslow 52-48 earlier on Friday.

            This will be the fourth meeting between the two schools with Page leading the series at 3-0.

            ""The odds are in our favor,"" Williams said. ""I like our odds and having a healthy squad is going to make a difference in our game.""

            Williams said she is not anticipating to see anything different but the outcome is going to come down to execution.

            ""They know us and we know them but I really hope that the kids from both sides will have a good game,"" she said. ""I know that (Page coach) Justin (Smith) wants to win the game as much as I do but sometimes we just have to let the kids play.

Newly sworn-in Council Delegate Kee Allen Begay becomes Speaker Pro Tem of the 23rd Navajo Nation Council for two weeks from Jan. 13 to 26, when he won by a coin toss. 

Begay called tails in the coin toss, while 22nd Navajo Nation Council Speaker Pro Tem LoRenzo Bates called heads. 

The coin toss, administered by the Navajo Election Administration, came after a 12-12 vote. When Council delegate Mel Begay asked legislative counsel what happens in matters of a tie, Ron Haven, an attorney from the Office of Legislative Counsel, recommended the coin toss.

Early in the special session, Bates had been recommend as speaker pro tem through an amendment to insert his name into the bill. But, the issue of Bates signaling to Council delegate David Filfred to make a motion to have him as speaker was an unfair process to Council delegate Dwight Witherspoon. 
Witherspoon's concerns eventually led to Filfred withdrawing his motion to have Bates' name inserted in the bill, which then resulted in the nomination process for speaker pro tem. Witherspoon advocated for the nomination process to the amendment process. 

As as result, Bates was then nominated by Filfred and Begay by Witherspoon. Council delegate Tom Chee was nominated by his peer Otto Tso, but he declined the nomination.

That pitted Begay against Bates for speaker pro tem.

Begay, a former member of the 21st Council and former legislative district assistant to ousted and former Speaker Johnny Naize, said he's not running for speaker during the winter session, when he was asked by Council Delegate Leonard Tsosie to step away from his nomination after the 12-12 vote.
But, Begay said that it wasn't fair for him to step down unless Witherspoon withdrew his nomination and if the 12 council members, who voted in his favor, agreed. 

At the winter session, which begins on Jan. 26, the new Council will select a new speaker from among its body, a two-year appointment.

The Council adjourned at 6:59 p.m.

Defense helps Gallup defeat Grants

By Sunnie R. Clahchischiligi

Navajo Times

 
GALLUP, N.M. -- The Gallup Bengals are the 71st Annual Gallup Boys Invitational Champions.

The Bengals defeated Grants Pirates 70-63, for the tournament title this evening in Gallup.

The competition was set to be a rematch between the two teams, as Gallup defeated Grants in the Pirates' home tournament just weeks ago.

Gallup head coach Domonic Romero said the team was able to clinch the win with their defense.

""It's kind of been our key to success, being able to put pressure (on teams),"" Romero said.

Navajo Times sports

The Rock Point girls basketball team improved its conference record 2-0 with a 51-21 win over El Capitan on Friday night. The Lady Cougars had to overcome a slow start as they lead 10-8 after one quarter. The Rock Point coach attribute that to not playing a game for three weeks. 

Nonetheless, her club got going in the second quarter and led 23-12 at the half before exploding for twenty two points in the third quarter for a 45-16 lead. 

In the boys' action Rock Point dropped a 67-28 decision. At halftime, the Cougars trailed El Capitan 52-8 at the break before they outscored the visitors 13-10 in the third quarter. Despite missing a couple of key players, first-year coach Ralston Descheny said his boys gave a better effort in the second half.

""We're missing my two point guards so my power forwards were bringing down the ball down the court all night "" he said. ""But at half time we were playing tough defense.""

In addition, Descheny said they were not turning over the ball and they also scored transition points to fuel the run in the third quarter.

This is according to a Dec.31 memo he wrote to Speaker Pro Tem Lorenzo Bates and the Navajo Nation Council.

Council passes resolution for a new presidential election to be held in June

WINDOW ROCK - In an 11-1 vote, the Navajo Nation Council approved legislation for a special run-off election and a special general election for the offices of the President and Vice President, during a special session Tuesday, according to a press release.

Council Delegate Charles Damon II voted against the bill.

Another legislation that seeks to pardon and reinstate nine former members of the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors was also approved.
President Ben Shelly has 10 calendar days to consider both resolutions. 
In addition, the bill would provide approximately $317,000 to the Navajo Election Administration to fund the elections.

Legislation sponsor Council Delegate Leonard Tsosie has repeatedly urged Council to seek a new presidential election since Navajo Nation Presidential candidate Chris Deschene was disqualified by former Office of Hearings and Appeals hearing officer Richie Nez on Oct. 9. 

The run-off election would occur in June of 2015, and a special general election would take place in August with the swearing in of a new president in September.

The legislation states that only the 17 original candidates who ran in the 2014 primary election would be qualified for the special run-off election if they choose to do so.",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10152908141156233/?type=3,2014-12-31 20:29:10,817,160,157,817,0,0,0,0,0

CHINLE — Steamboat, Ariz. lost one of its commissioners and an important member of the community in a car crash Friday, Commission Manager Flora Nez confirmed Monday.
Deborah Cayedito, 59, was the president of the Navajo Nation Government Development Commission and a member of the Diné Community Advocates Alliance as well as a commissioner for Steamboat community.
Funeral services will be Thursday at 9 a.m. in the Steamboat LDS Church with Peter Yazzie officiating.
Cayedito and another person died in a one-car rollover near Bitahochee, Ariz., Friday. A third occupant was taken to an area hospital and is in critical condition. The names of the other two victims could not be confirmed by press time.
According to Yazzie, who was related to Cayedito by marriage, the car was not Cayedito's and it is not yet clear who was driving as all three occupants were ejected. The car rolled repeatedly for about 50 feet, Yazzie said.
Cayedito was an outspoken proponent of the recently passed Healthy Diné Nation Act, which will levy a tax on junk food to be put toward diabetes prevention.
Nez described Cayedito as ""happy.""
Cayedito was born and raised in California, according to Yazzie, and came back to the reservation as an adult.
""She was involved in all kinds of community activities,"" Yazzie said. ""One thing she did was a music festival, Steamboat Rocks. She would get donations and feed the whole crowd for free.
""The loss to our community is unfathomable,"" he added.
The day before her demise, Cayedito had posted on Facebook a thank-you to Council Delegate Jonathan Nez for supporting the Healthy Diné Nation Act and a quote from Ferdinand Foch, the supreme commander of the Allied Forces during World War I: ""The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire.""
""Yup, my soul is on fire,"" she had written above it.

President Ben Shelly vetoed a resolution approved by the Navajo Nation Council on Oct. 24 , which sought to amend language requirements within the Navajo Nation Election Code.

On Wednesday, the Naabik'iyátí' Committee voted 12-5 and approved the language requirement override legislation.

WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ The Navajo Nation has received funding from a massive settlement in a case that alleged the federal government mismanaged the tribe's natural resources, according to a press release from the legislative branch. 

The $554 million settlement represents the largest, single amount for an American Indian tribe among more than 100 similar cases filed against the U.S. government. The Navajo Nation Council approved it in May.

According to the press release, 12 percent goes to the Permanent Trust Fund, 2 percent to the Land Acquisition Fund and 4 percent for the Veterans Trust Fund after attorneys' fees are paid. The remaining balance will be $409 million. 

The legislative branch is holding public hearings on how the funds should be used. The latest was held Saturday at the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute's Science and Technology Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The funds cannot be used or invested until the ongoing legislative public hearings conclude, and legislation is introduced and approved by council said Bates.

By Cindy Yurth
Tséyi' Bureau
 
BLUE GAP, Ariz. — Out here on Johnny Naize's old turf, a close contest has developed between two young, energetic Council candidates who have both been campaigning hard.
Yeah, nobody wants to talk about that.
One voter couldn't even remember the name of the candidate he chose.
""You know … the lady,"" he said.
That would be Crystalyne Curley, since her opponent, Kee Allen Begay, is a guy.
But the name on everybody's tongue, even though any votes for him today will not be counted, is Chris Deschene, the candidate ousted by the Navajo Nation Supreme Court Thursday for not speaking fluent Navajo.
""It's all confused,"" complained Eula A. Begay of Nazlini, who came to the poll not knowing whether she'd be able to vote for president or not. Deschene's name was on the ballot, but voters were being instructed by poll workers not to vote for president, since that election will be postponed following Thursday's Supreme Court hearing in Chinle.
Af that hearing, the justices found the Navajo Nation Board of Election Supervisors in contempt of court for not postponing the election and removing Deschene's name from the ballot as the court had previously ordered.
""What are they going to do next, postpone Christmas?"" asked Kathy Begay of Tsélani/Cottonwood Chapter after casting her ballot. ""Why don't we just have Christmas in January this year!""
Nelson Bahe, also of Tsélani/Cottonwood, said he had already voted early for Deschene and was upset his vote would not count.
""I fought in Vietnam in 1968,"" he said. ""I never thought I would return to my own reservation one day and they would throw away my vote.""
Avis Thomas of Chinle said she had voted for Deschene and she's not giving up.
""See my truck?"" she asked, pointing to a pickup with two Deschene/Atcitty posters affixed to its tailgate. ""I don't care what they tell me. I'm driving it around like that until Chris is sworn into office. It's my vote and I'm going to defend it.""
Even some Joe Shirley supporters seemed sympathetic.
""I'm voting for Shirley,"" said Eula Begay, 65, ""but I don't like the way they kicked that young man off the ballot. It's just dividing us. Who leads us is important, yes, but is it more important than all of us getting along?""
Out in Blue Gap, Ella Vena felt the same way. ""I support Joe Shirley,"" she said, ""but I think the right thing to do is to let this kid in. Give him a chance. Not letting him in is going to further divide our people.""
Calvin Begay, also of Blue Gap/Tachee Chapter, disagreed.
""He straight-out lied!"" he said of Deschene. ""Why would you vote for a liar?""
Another woman, who declined to give her name, thought the Supreme Court had made the right decision.
""The law says he has to be fluent,"" she said. ""That's the qualification. I don't know why they had to wait till the last minute to decide this.""",,status,,2014-11-05 00:08:35,519,193,82,519,0,0,0,0,0

But, there is argument over it now, that the young have started asking, ""Am I not Navajo?"" Our children, we are not doing this to break our family.

So, young men, young women, and all of our children, we have you in mind. It is probably true, we as parents, did not pass on our teachings, but this does not mean our young ones and our elderly should blame one another for it, nor should they think they are not one and the same. Take care of our language, think about it, and that way, you will understand and know it. This is our plea. 

Perhaps our leaders will start working on this issue, so that our children will learn our language, hear and speak our language again. But, because we were colonized through assimilation we have started losing our language and it has become difficult to speak; we want to keep our Navajo way of life, our language, our prayers and songs, alive.

Western Agency Bureau
 
 
 
     KAIBETO, Ariz. - Authorities say Navajo police officer Joseph Gregg was shot in the face with a 12-gauge shotgun and is now in stable condition at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, Ariz.
 
     Gregg, 40, who is with the Tuba City Police District, was caught up in gunfire on Saturday at a residence along Route 21 where he was responding to a domestic disturbance call. 
 
     Gregg's family says he was working alone in the area every weekend. 
     Navajo Nation spokesman Deswood Tome said, ""The assailant shot and wounded him, Gregg.""
 
     Tome says Gregg returned fire and shot the suspect. The name of the suspect was not released. Authorities say the suspect then barricaded himself in a home. Thereafter, Gregg was airlifted to Flagstaff Medical Center. 
 
     Later on, the suspect was apprehended.
 
     ""This unspeakable violence and alcohol is tearing our families and communities apart,"" said Coconino County District 5 Supervisor Lena Fowler of the incident. ""Our prayers are with officer Joseph Gregg and his family tonight.""
    
     In 2011, the late Sgt. Darrell C. Curley, was shot and killed in the line of duty while also responding to a domestic disturbance call.
 
     It is not uncommon that Navajo police officers work individually, rather than with a partner.
 
     ""It breaks my heart knowing he did not have backup, ""Shanna Gregg-Starblanket said, sister of Gregg. ""It makes me wonder how long did he have to suffer alone, wounded, not knowing if there was anyone else around who would hurt him.""

       The photograph, taken by Western Agency Bureau reporter Krista Allen, shows officer Gregg, 40, paying tribute to police officers killed in the line of duty on Memorial Day in Page, Ariz., during the Wall of Honor dedication, which took place at the Page Memorial Plaza.

Navajo Times

 

WINDOW ROCK - Once again, the decision to disqualify Navajo Nation Presidential Candidate Christopher Clark Deschene was pushed back ""until further notice.""

In a confined room at the Office of Hearing and Appeals Friday morning, the matter whether Deschene is qualified for president or not was taken before Richie Nez, OHA's hearing officer assigned to the case.

The circumstance came before the Navajo Nation Supreme Court on Sept. 26 at Tuba City Judicial Court on an appeal from an election grievance concerning the 43-year-old candidate from LeChee, Ariz.

The court last Friday reversed the OHA's decision, which it said erred in summarily dismissing the grievances filed by the appellants - Dale Edison Tsosie and Hank Whitethorne. Both Tsosie and Whitethorne are from Western Navajo and former presidential candidates that lost during the Aug. 26 Navajo Nation Primaries. The high court stated at last Friday's hearing OHA had the authority to consider the grievances and remanded the case back to the lower court.

In remanding the matter, the court stated that the qualification for fluency in the Navajo language is a reasonable regulation to a candidate's right to political liberty. And the court ended by asserting that the meaning and standard of ""fluency,"" as Whitethorne suggested in Navajo: If one speaks Navajo, they will interpret and understand Navajo.

Nez opened the hearing about whether Deschene needs a Diné Bizaad fluency test or not according to the standards of the court. The high court reaffirmed the importance of an elected leader speaking Navajo, essentially a directive or guideline the OHA has to use in its decision.

In his motion, Deschene's attorney Brian Lewis said the OHA should dismiss the hearing.

""This matter represents a case which is not entirely a case,"" said Lewis. ""There's not a proper party respondent here to grant the relief. And the relief in remedy sought here are really what's key.""

""The petitioners (Tsosie and Whitethorne) aren't seeking some sort of vague declaration or even specific declaration that Deschene is disqualified or ineligible to run for president of the Navajo Nation,"" continued Lewis. ""The petitioners need injunctive relief. They actually need a mandatory injunction which would direct the Navajo Election Administration to reverse this, of Deschene's qualifications.""

In response, Tsosie's attorney David R. Jordan said, ""This is not that kind of case.""

""We're (Tsosie and Whitethorne) directly challenging the candidate's actions,"" continued Jordan. ""We're saying that Deschene lied when he told the Navajo people in April 2014 that he was fluent in the Navajo language.""

Arguments from both parties lasted until about 11:45 a.m. before Nez called recess. The hearing officer stated that a decision would be made of whether Deschene would take the fluency test or not.

But, as soon as the parties reconvened at 1 p.m. Friday afternoon, Nez informed the parties, who met behind closed doors, that Deschene would give a ""deposition"" in Navajo at the Gallup law office of David R. Jordan.

Deschene is scheduled to offer his deposition at 9 a.m. Monday. A deposition is an out-of-court statement that, in this case, would be specific to the presidential candidate's qualifications. 

After Deschene's deposition, Nez said a decision would be made on whether the candidate successfully meets the Navajo language requirements for the tribal presidency.

By Alastair Lee Bitsoi
Navajo Times

                  

WINDOW ROCK – Western Refining Southwest Inc., has withdrawn its application for a liquor license at its Tohlakai Giant Convenient and Gas Station, according to Gary Hanson, the company's vice president for corporate communications.

                  In a telephone interview with the Navajo Times Friday afternoon, Hanson verified the news, saying, ""We made the decision this afternoon to withdraw that application.""

                  Hanson said that the company contacted New Mexico's Alcohol and Gaming Division Friday at noon informing the entity of its withdrawal of the liquor application.  Western Refining had notified the public of its liquor license on Sept. 16, and had an Oct. 6 deadline for the public to object to its proposal. 

""Our customers have spoken,"" Hanson added. ""We wanted to hear their needs and its something they didn't desire. We agreed to withdraw that (liquor license) application."" 

                  News of the company's liquor plans at the gas station, which borders the Navajo communities of Tohlakai and Twin Lakes, N.M., had resulted in the formation of community protests led by the ""Standing for Tohlakai Alliance"" and Dine Bidziil.   

                  Early Tulley, spokesman for the alliance, stated that the community of Tohlakai had faced the threats of alcohol sales since 1987. And, he said, the news of the company withdrawing its application largely comes from the united front that protested the company's alcohol sales plans.

The alliance had organized two protests in the last two weeks at the convenience store, and also circulated a petition and letters of objection to Western Refining's plans that it will submit to the Alcohol and Gaming Division.

                  ""The community has carried on a very strong message,"" Tulley said, adding that the media also had a major influence on advocating for the local communities. 

                  He added, ""The media is the true crier for our community and the reporters are the ones that are the historians, and I believe they didn't want to have this written down as such."" 

                  The alliance, in response to Western Refining's plans, had circulated petitions – with more than 8,000 people signing it – that oppose the liquor proposal.  The alliance was out in Shiprock at the annual Northern Navajo Fair Friday collecting signatures from people there, Tulley said. 

""There is no secret, but reaching out and getting support,"" Tulley said about Tohlakai's successful track record of denying alcohol sales for the third time since 1987.

                  Tulley said he would call the Alcohol and Gaming Division on Monday to verify the company's decision.

""Until we get official notice, we still want to go to Santa Fe to deliver this (petitions and letters of objection),"" he added. ""We're still going to go through with it and follow up. Its not to say I don't' trust them, but I hate to do all this work and not deliver on our end.""

By Krista Allen

Navajo Times

 
     WINDOW ROCK – Just a day before she would be coroneted as 2014-2015 Naabeehó Bich'eekį', McKeon Dempsey smiled and greeted an eager public with the charm and grace of a queen during the Miss Navajo Contestant Meet & Greet.

     On Saturday evening, she walked across the platform in an elegant, purple traditional outfit in hopes of her childhood ambition of becoming the next Miss Navajo. Moments later, her dream came true in front of a capacity crowd and the World Wide Web, courtesy of NNTV5. Dempsey is now officially an ambassador and educator for Diné Bikéyah.

     In her acceptance speech, she said tearfully with a trembling voice, ""I'm honored and privileged to be your new Miss Navajo Nation. It was a long process and it has been a lifelong dream … I will do my best to represent you and our people – what we stand for and what we've been fighting for.""

     Dempsey, 24, is Kinyaa'áanii, born for Tsé Deeshgizhníí. Her maternal grandfather is Bįįh Bitoodnii. She is the daughter of the late Marilyn Dempsey, who was a Diné culture teacher in Oak Springs, Ariz.

     About her mother, McKeon said, ""She supported me throughout my educational goals. I know this is what she wanted for me. I wish she was here with me now.""

      The new Miss Navajo's platform will center on the Diné language. Her plan incorporates implementing art into community projects for the youth.

     ""It's surrounding art,"" said Dempsey in an interview with the Navajo Times after the coronation ceremony. ""I'll be trying to influence the youth through art, culture, language, and values.""

     She is also the recipient of the best essay award. Among her prizes includes a traditional outfit sponsored by former Miss Navajo Winifred Bessie Jumbo (2010-2011), a silver pin and a Pendleton bag from NACE, and a trophy from former Miss Navajo Jonathea Tso (2007-2008).

     She received the best butcher award from Navajo Gaming Enterprise.",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10152651239141233/?type=3,2014-09-07 01:03:58,4955,232,606,4955,0,0,0,0,0

By Shondiin Silversmith

Navajo Times

STEAMBOAT, ARIZ. - With primary elections underway all across the Navajo Nation many Navajo communities are executing their right to vote at their local Chapter House.

In the western agency Steamboat Chapter has 1150 registered voters and has seen a steady stream of them come into vote for either the Navajo Nation or Apache County. There at over 45,000 people registered to vote in Apache County, according to officials at Steamboat Chapter.

For local voter Roselyn Barney along with her parents, coming to the chapter house has been a tradition for their family every four years. 

""We always vote every four years and for them (her parents) it's a good time for them to see there friends and relatives they never see,"" Barney said, adding that they chose to vote because they believe it helps the Navajo Nation. 

But not everyone has a voting tradition in fact for local Rita Kee she hasn't voted since Peterson Zah ran for presidency. 

Her reasoning was she just never re registered to vote when she moved away from Steamboat several years ago. 

But now Kee said she was happy to cast a vote today because she likes it. 

""I don't know which one is going to win, but I don't mind,"" Kee added, noting that she only knew who a few of the candidates were.

By Alastair Lee Bitsoi
Navajo Times

                NASCHITTI, N.M. – For the second time this summer, Arlene Baloo was asked by Navajo Nation Police Officers to evacuate her home.

                She was told by police officers Thursday morning to evacuate her home because, at mile marker 43 on U.S. Highway 491, a tractor trailer hauling toxic material caught fire. The burning trailer emitted huge plumes of dark smoke that could be seen for miles.

                The accident forced the shutdown of the major highway, which serves as a corridor to the Four Corners area. As of noon, the road was still closed, according to New Mexico State Transportation officials.  Southbound travelers will be detoured onto Navajo Route 5, north of Newcomb, N.M., then U.S. Highway 371.  There is no alternative route, at this time, for northbound travelers.

                ""All I heard was a big boom or something this morning when I was in the house,"" said Baloo, who lives less than half a mile and in plain view of where the semi-trailer caught fire.

                It occurred at about 6:40 a.m. this morning, Baloo said, noting that she saw the driver of the semi detach one of the trailers of the two-trailer diesel truck.

                Seeing the fire and then the smoke from outside her house, said she called the local police and fire departments, who were on the scene between 7:30 and 8 a.m.

                The evacuation was mandated by the Navajo Nation Emergency Response Team, and applies to residents living within a two-mile radius of the accident.

                ""That even includes the Naschitti Chapter House,"" said Rose Whitehair, director for the Navajo Nation's Department of Emergency Management, about the evacuation order, which is merely a precautionary measure.

                Currently, the hazardous materials waste team from San Juan County is on scene assessing the incident, Whitehair said.

                In response to the evacuation, shelters have been set up in Tohatchi and Newcomb chapters. Evacuees who live north of the scene will be sheltered at Newcomb and those south of the scene will seek assistance in Tohatchi, Whitehair said.  

                The evacuation order is the second the community of Naschitti has experienced this summer. In June, community members living in the Chooshgai Mountains and in Naschitti were told to evacuate their homes by fire and police officials because of the raging 14,000-acre Assayii Lake Fire that went out of control from strong, gusty winds and blanketed the community with intense smoke.

                Whitehair said these emergency situations serve as a reminder for the public to always be prepared for a disaster and have a to-go survival kit readily available.

                ""For your safety, stay away from the smoke,"" Whitehair stated in an Aug. 7 press release. ""The more distance between you and the source of the smoke, the better.""

                Whitehair also stated that it's vital for the public to close and lock doors and keep windows of their homes closed. Other reminders include seeking medical attention if individuals have difficulty breathing, irritation of the eyes, skin, throat or respiratory tract, she said, among other health issues.

                ""The hazardous material team is on site and will make a final determination of the chemicals and how they're going to handle the scene,"" Whitehair added.

Moroni Benally answered with,
""This gets back to the entire management system of the Navajo Nation, they are stretched beyond their means.""

Moroni Benally explained that the tribal government lacks the capacity to successfully resolve this problem due to a lack of logistics, education, skill or credentials.  The people running many programs are not qualified to do so, he says.

""We need to replace these people right now.  This is not just about dogs, it is about a larger issue.""

By Terry Bowman
Navajo Times

 
            CRYSTAL, N.M.— A blaze that started in the Chuska Mountains on Friday has consumed more forestland near Asááyi Lake as fire crews try to contain the inferno.

            According to Patrick Willeto, the lead dispatcher with the Bureau of Indian Affairs of Forestry and Wildland Fire Management, the fire has reached roughly 200 acres traveling due east, nearing the Whiskey Lake area.

            With plenty of dry vegetation and sustained winds of over 30 mph, Willeto said the fire has grown by over 125 acres within the last 24 hours.

            Willeto said the Navajo Scouts fire crew will be working around the clock until the blaze is fully contained.

            The area is under a fire weather watch according to the National Weather Service until Monday evening, where strong winds and low humidity are present.

            No injuries have been reported since the fire started on Friday. According to officials, the source of the fire has not been determined.

            For more information call the Bureau of Indian Affairs Division of Forestry and Wildland Fire Management at (928)-729-2307 or the Window Rock Police District at (928) 871-6111.",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10152462979331233/?type=3,2014-06-15 00:45:47,1384,157,734,1384,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Times
 
CRYSTAL, N.M. — At least 90 acres of land have been consumed from a forest fire burning in the Chuska Mountains north of Asááyi Lake Friday evening, and no one knows why.
Officials say the cause of the fire is still unknown as fire crews from the Navajo Pine Volunteer Fire Department, Bureau of Indian Affairs Division of Forestry and Wildland Fire Management and workers from Navajo Parks and Recreation rush to stop the blaze that occurred around noon on Friday, June 13 on Indian Service Route 311 near Navajo, N.M.
As of 5:30 p.m. 75 acres had already been reported gone as smoke and flames sprouted north of Asááyi Lake from a ridge known as Big Bowl Canyon.
According to Navajo Pine Fire Chief Denniford Deschine, the fire sparked in the early afternoon and was reported by people fishing at Asááyi Lake around 2 p.m. With two fire crews from Navajo Pine first responding, Deschine said the cause of the fire is still unknown and an investigation is pending. The fire may have resulted from extreme dry conditions and drought brought on by hot temperatures and dry vegetation, according to Deschine.  
Johnson Benally of the B.I.A. Wildland Fire Management said the current plan is to secure the south side of the fire near Bowl Canyon Creek to keep the fire away from spreading to nearby Bowl Canyon Recreation Area and the Asááyi Lake Youth Camp.
With the Navajo Scouts Type 2 IA fire crew still en-route, Benally said the next course of action would be to secure the north side of the ridge near Big Bowl Canyon to keep the fire from spreading north along Indian Service Route 32 towards Narbona Pass.
""Once they (Navajo Scouts) get here we're going to try and flank off the north side,"" said Benally, who said that all fire crews will stop around 10 p.m. and will be back early this morning to continue the fighting the fire before the morning winds pick up.

By Cindy Yurth
Tseyi' Bureau

While some of their colleagues were at the annual powwow or leaving for home for the weekend, a crew Of Dine College students were hard at work Friday evening creating what they hope will be the world's largest frybread. The huge hunk of dough will introduce a new category to the Guinness Book if World Records. ""We wanted something that would unite the community,"" explained student body president Robin McGee, ""Somthing the whole campus could get involved in."" At 6:40 pm the students had mixed 267 pounds of dough in three batches and were preparing to carry it to an outdoor fire where it will be fried in a giant pan created by welding students at Chinle High School. Although no previous record exists, the students are hoping the finished product will weigh at least 150 pounds.

Navajo Word Of The Day- Atsiits'iin

This Navajo word means ""the head."" Or, it can also refer to something that functions like the brain, meaning that it provides the controls to move the rest of the body.
To say ""my head"" the word becomes ""shitsiits'iin"" and ""your head"" is ""n(i)tsiits'iin"" and ""his/its head"" is ""bitsiits'iin."" You can see with these words how to use shí, ní and bí.
So if I say to the phrase, ""chidí bitsiits'iin"" what do you think I am talking about? That phrase is a creative use of atsiits'iin to refer to a car or truck's engine, referring to the piston heads that drive the motor.

Most candidates waiting for election filing deadline

By Bill Donovan 
Special to the Times

WINDOW ROCK - The latest readout of people who have gone to the election office to pick up filing papers for the upcoming election as well as those who have paid their filing fees shows that a lot of people are taking a wait-and-see attitude. While the filing of candidates is usually slow in tribal elections, the last two weeks have seen only a handful of new candidates picking up filing papers and no new candidates for president. People have until May 28 to officially file their candidacy and pay their fees ($1,500 for tribal chairman, $500 for council and $200 for other positions), and election officials said they are expecting that most will probably do it, as happened in past elections, in the last two days before the deadline.",,status,,2014-04-10 10:59:00,78,5,3,78,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word Of The Day- Shik'is

Literally: my friend.
The Navajo word ak'is means friend, so shí, ní, or bí is attached to mean my, your, or his (her). This word is essentially used to describe siblings and maternal cousins, but in all of these cases it only applies to people of the same sex.

Modern usage has somewhat allowed the word to be applied to friendships between men and women. But, in the old days, you simply could not say that a woman was just your friend (if you were a man), or that a man was just your friend (if you were a woman). Especially when it was not uncommon for men to have multiple wives.

Navajo Word Of The Day- Béégashii bitsį'

English translation: beef. The word actually translates to ""a cow - its meat."" So this is more like two words.
Béégashii is the Navajo word for cow, or cattle. The latter part of the phrase, bitsį', uses the bi- suffix to mean ""he"" or ""it"" along with the word -tsį', which means meat (atsį').
Here's a quick info-bit: the Apache language and the Navajo language share similar words for cow — the Apache word using the ""maa"" sound in place of the Navajo ""béé"" sound.

Continuing today with words adopted by the Navajo language, obáama is one of those unique words that use the letter 'm.' In most cases, you could use the word to simply imply that an act was performed completely autonomously. Furthermore, there are times when you may hear this word used excessively in order to convey immediate hardship experienced by the speaker, with the implication that such hardship is directly unwanted nor desired.

Example: Yádiláh! I had to bring the sheep in óbáámá self!

Almost everyone has an image of what their wedding would look like when the time comes, and for couple Shannon Watson and Matt Zullo it involves not only matrimony but also the stress-free feeling that comes with not picking up the tab.

""We just want to enjoy our wedding,"" said Watson, 30. ""Spend the day with our friends and family and celebrate. Matt and I have been dating for more than 12 years, so during that time we have had tons of people ask us, 'So, when are you two getting married?'

""The true answer to that questions is that we have not been able to afford to get married without putting a financial burden on our families or ourselves,"" she added. ""So, when this contest came along, it seemed like the perfect chance at getting the dream wedding that we have always wanted.""

Out of nearly 200 video submissions to the ""Say Yes!"" Wedding Sweepstakes held by Encanterra Country Club, Watson and Zullo were one of 16 couples selected as a finalists.

By Krista Allen

Western Agency Bureau

     TUBA CITY − The Hopi Tribe's former chairperson is a wanted man.  

     Benjamin H. Nuvamsa, 65, from Shungopavi Village in Second Mesa, Ariz. is facing a warrant for theft, in violation of Hopi Code Section 3.8.4.B., which states that theft of property or services with a value of $2,000 or more is guilty of a serious offense.

     According to the criminal complaint provided by the Hopi Tribal Court, Nuvamsa knowingly took a Louis Tewanima sculpture from the Hopi Museum in Second Mesa. 

     The bronze sculpture is of Louis Tewanima, a Kiis'áanii two-time Olympic distance runner and silver medalist in the 10,000 meter run in 1912 at the Stockholm Games, measures about 13 inches wide and 24 inches in length.

     The complaint states that Nuvamsa had no permission from the Museum to take the bust valued at approximately $8,000.  

     Nuvamsa failed to appear in court earlier this month for arraignment. An arrest warrant has been issued against him under a $200 secured bond. 

     Benjamin Nuvamsa is the founder of the KIVA Institute and a former Agency Superintendent. The Institute's website reveals that he is a noted national expert on the Indian Self-determination Act.",,status,,2014-03-25 18:13:23,172,44,50,172,0,0,0,0,0

   HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel will air ""Rez Ball,"" featuring Native American basketball players, at 10 p.m. tonight. 



   The top-ranked Louisville women's basketball team is being led by two Native American sisters.  Shoni, superstar senior guard, leads the team in scoring and is projected to be top WNBA draft pick next year and sister Jude, a junior, is the team's steady sixth woman. 
   According to hbo.com, the Schimmels' have come to represent the hopes and dreams of thousands of Native Americans across the country for whom basketball is much more then just a sport... it is an escape - literally and figuratively.
   Life for Native Americans living on reservations in the US remains difficult, the website states. Chronic unemployment, poverty, limited educational opportunities and high levels of drug and alcohol abuse have plagued residents for decades...and life on the Umatilla reservation in Pendleton, Oregon is no different. This is the world Shoni and Jude Schimmel grew up in... becoming familiar with the history of their people, participating in tribal customs such as the pow-wow, and learning the native and vanishing language of her Umatilla ancestors.
   For the Schimmel sisters and many other Native Americans living on the reservations, basketball is the national pastime. It is a sport that isn't expensive to play, and brings close-knit communities indoors during the cold winter months. Everyone on the reservation has a hoop. On dirt courts, with bent rusted rims, flour is used to mark sidelines.
   The segment will also feature video footage and interviews from the Arizona state tournament game, which included the Chinle Wildcats and the Alchesay Falcons in Kayenta, Ariz. in February.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – It took about four months, 29 victories and team from Southeastern New Mexico for the Shiprock Lady Chiefs to pick up their first and only loss of the season.
The No. 1-seeded Lady Chiefs fell to the No. 3 Portales Rams 62-59, in the 3A championship game Friday afternoon at The Pit. Shiprock wraps up their season 29-1 overall.
Missed shots and fouls got the best of the Lady Chiefs as they gave the Rams 28 points from the free-throw line and shot an average of 36-percent throughout the game.
Shiprock head coach Larenson Henderson said for the first time all season his team may have met their match.
""We missed a lot of shots and free throws kind of hurt us too, if we were playing again I think it would go the other way…they just got the big one,"" he said. ""They (Shiprock) were determined to come back and win it all. This one is going to really hurt them.""
The Lady Chiefs were led by senior Taylor Henderson who had 13 points and Tanisha Begay had 10. Portales was led by Kambrey Blakey who had 23 and Sheraya Cox who had 17.

Navajo Word Of The Day- Shádi'ááh

This is the second of the four cardinal directions of the Navajo: South. (The first being ha'a'aah). Though the direction is South, the meaning of the word itself refers to the sun, where at its highest point it is generally in that direction - shá being the sun.

As such, the direction is traditionally significant because it symbolizes the beginning of order to freedom of thought and creativity — a kind of purpose or aim.

Navajo Times
 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – The Shiprock Lady Chieftains are not just No. 1, they are the only one.
The only area team left in the state basketball tournament that is.
The Lady Chiefs defeated No. 4 Hope Christian 63-35 in the semi-finals on Thursday to advance to the 3A title game with No. 3 Portales that is set for today at 3:30 p.m. at The Pit.
The match with Portales is a rematch of the 2002 state title game when the Lady Chiefs defeated the Rams 75-60 for the championship title. It was the last time Shiprock earned a state title in girls' basketball.
This year is also the first time in 25 years the Lady Chiefs have entered the state tournament with an undefeated record. Shiprock is now 29-0. In 1989, coached under Jerry Richardson, the Lady Chiefs entered the championship game 26-0. They then went onto win the state championship title over archrivals Kirtland Central 85-55.
Coincidently, the 1989 Shiprock Lady Chiefs will be recognized at 3 p.m. today at The Pit, before Shiprock and Portales tip off.
The last time Shiprock girls made it to the championship game was in 2011, coached by former Shiprock coach Brady Rivers, and lost to Santa Fe Indian School to finish in second place.
Those who didn't fair as well in the semi-finals yesterday were the Gallup Lady Bengals and the Laguna Acoma boys' and girls' teams.
Gallup was defeated by district 6-4A rivals and No. 1 Los Lunas 67-41. The Tigers got a jump-start on the Bengals and Gallup had trouble finding their offense. They end their season 21-9.
Laguna Acoma girls suffered a 35-26 loss to No. 1 Texico. They finished their season 24-6
The No. 1 Laguna Acoma boys' team faced an upset by No. 4 Texico, 63-59. Texico gave them their only loss of the season 29-1.

Gallup advances behind McIntosh's all-around game
 
By Quentin Jodie
Navajo Times
 
GALLUP – For most of the night, Ni'asia McIntosh was just being herself.
Lately, the Gallup sophomore has been putting up some gaudy numbers.
On Friday night, the Gallup team turned to her as she put forth a dominant performance in leading the No. 4 seed Bengals to a 62-45 win over Artesia in the opening round of the New Mexico Class 4A state girls basketball tournament.
McIntosh scored a game-high 27 points, to go along with 20 rebounds and six blocks.
""She had a killer game and the scary thing is she is not close to being finish developing as a player,"" Gallup coach Kamau Turner said of his 6-foot-2 post. ""If she wants the sky is the limit for her. If she wants to work she can become a real great player.""
Despite Artesia's length and size, Turner said McIntosh found other ways to score as the Bulldogs packed the paint and limited the number of touches she had inside.
""One thing I give Artesia credit is there size,"" Turner said. ""Their game plan was to take away from us throwing the ball inside. Their size was able to do that a lot and I don't think we fed Ni'asia enough on the inside.""
Instead McIntosh made her presence felt by hitting the boards on the offensive end. She scored the games' first eight points with three baskets coming on putbacks.
""I was just focused on getting position and that lead to some of my points,"" McIntosh said. ""What I did was good but I thought we played as a team and we wanted to get this win.""
McIntosh added three more putbacks in the second quarter and by the half she had put up 17 points. But the biggest difference came on the other end of the floor as Gallup took a 31-13 halftime advantage.
""I thought we played real well, especially defensively,"" Turner said. ""We only gave up 13 points in the first half, which is real good.""
In the final six minutes of the half, the Bengals held Artesia to only one field goal. Those defensive stops helped Gallup go on a scoring run as they closed out the half on a 17-3 spurt.
Fifteen of those points were made in a three-minute stretch as the Bengals scored on six consecutive positions to break open a close game.
""Early on we were settling for jump shots and they were open jump shots,"" Turner said. ""We worked hard for those open jump shots but after two or three that don't go and then you have to get more aggressive and attack the hoop.""
In the midst of that rally, Gallup also made two treys – one each by senior Rebecca Herrera and junior Tilea Reyna – and finished the game with a 3-for-16 effort.
""We haven't shot or made a lot of threes this year,"" Turner said. ""One thing I did notice that we were passing up a lot of them through the year and if we're going to be 3-for-16 that's fine because the shots we were getting were good three-point shots. All we have to do is knock them down.""
After the break, the Bengals pushed its lead to 41-13 behind a 10-0 run with McIntosh and senior forward Rachelle Blackgoat combining for eight points.
With that, the damage was already done even though Artesia managed to outscore Gallup 32 to 19 the rest of the way.
The Bulldogs put together its best quarter of the night in the fourth by scoring 21 points behind junior guard Santana Calvillo's 10 markers.
Calvillo finished the game with 11 points and shared top team scoring honors with teammate Madison Willingham.
For Gallup, McIntosh led the way but she got plenty of help. Nine players scored with Kaylee Tsiniginie, Rebecca Smith, Blackgoat and Torrez scoring six points each.
On Tuesday, Gallup is scheduled to take on No. 5 Espanola Valley at 8:15 at the Pit in Albuquerque. Espanola Valley eliminated No. 12 seed Belen, 54-42.",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10152257603226233/?type=3,2014-03-08 02:40:48,620,24,44,620,0,0,0,0,0

Today's word is the general Navajo term for money, and also a more specific reference to dollar bills. You've probably noticed by now that the Navajo language doesn't like to use the letter 'P'. Instead, it uses 'B'.

By Quentin Jodie
Navajo Times
 
PHOENIX – As a first-year coach Mac Beach knows enough about the program's history at Window Rock High School.
For more than two decades Window Rock has been a fixture at the state basketball tournament. And for the last two years the Lady Scouts have reached the semifinals of the Arizona Division III bracket.
Needless to say, reaching this year's Final Four round was a tall task considering the talent they lost from last year's squad.
""I am not surprised,"" Beach said of his squad reaching this stage for the second straight year. ""We've had our ups and downs during the season but right now we are doing what we need to do…we are playing good defense so I think we're in good shape.""
As the tournament's No. 4 seed, the Scouts will be a heavy underdog against top-seeded Valley Christian in today's semifinals, which is scheduled to take place at 6:15 p.m. at Jobing.com Arena in Glendale, Ariz.
""This is going to be a good test for us,"" senior guard Naomi Klah said. ""Valley Christian is a good team but we're excited to play them.""
Beach said they have to make smart decisions as Valley Christian enters this contest riding on a 32-game winning streak.
""They (Valley Christian) play defense very well,"" Beach said. ""We need to limit our turnovers and look for some decent shots.""
In addition, the Window Rock coach said their success will depend on how they do on the boards.
""We're going to need to rebound,"" he said. ""We have to do a good job at boxing out.""",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10152241588626233/?type=3,2014-02-28 17:57:41,537,28,24,537,0,0,0,0,0

Uncertainties still concern for people

Lorenzo Bates stated in Tuesday's Farmington Daily Times newspaper that he informed the community members in all six chapters about the mine purchase. However, as I stated in this same article, only English was spoken by Mr. Bates, so how does he know if he got his message across. He only speaks English, so he can't really explain an important issue such as ""the purchase of BHP mine"" to the non-English speaking community members. Most of these community members are our elders. Some elders from Tiis Tsoh Sikaad Chapter complained they did not understand a word their Council delegate talked about and they said, ""We don't know what he talked about and it would have been better if he had an interpreter.""

Mr. Bates did not try very hard to inform his chapters, he did not provide an interpreter, and he himself did not bother to organize any public meetings, or pass out information at the special Council sessions. Not only the six chapters he serves but what about the 110 chapters across the Navajo Nation? So he failed the people.

As for Speaker Johnny Naize, he stated in Tuesday's Farmington Daily Times, ""When the council took office, they took steps to be more transparent."" He also said, ""The one way they are transparent is by implementing a five-day comment period, which allows the public's written comments to be passed along to delegates and ensures that the public's voices are heard by their leaders."" I disagree - this five-day comment period does not work and it is made to fail.

Even Council Delegate Katherine Benally has stated to forget the five-day comments because it don't mean a thing. We have people living out in the country far from power lines, some have electricity but they do not have Internet and no computers to get their information on comment periods. We have people who can't read English and have no idea what Internet is. This western system of transparency does not work for Diné people, so I say our rights as Diné people is being violated when it comes to big corporation deals, it's all done in Window Rock behind close doors with no transparency and accountability.

As for the BHP Billiton loaning $85 million to NTEC, Mr. Pat Risner states that this money will be paid back through cash flow generated by coal sales from the mine to Four Corners Power Plant. My question is, ""What if the coal sales is a failure and what if it does not generate enough money to pay back BHP Billiton? What happens then? Will Navajo Nation have to step in and help pay the loan back? All these uncertainties along with the liability waiver are still a big concern for the Diné people.

We send out love out to all & ask that you help get the word to our friends & family that his next stage of this life will be coming soon.

147969681232_10152181770971233,"Flu cases 'widespread' this year

   PHOENIX - After a steady increase in flu cases this year, Arizona flu activity hit widespread this week, the highest category possible, according to a news release from the Arizona Department of Health Services.
   Influenza has been reported in all 15 counties. Most of the circulating flu is the 2009 H1N1 virus. Doctor and hospital visits for flu have increased over the last few weeks around the state.
   Influenza is a serious illness with symptoms similar to the common cold. However, the flu comes on quickly and is more physically draining. For most people, the best care is to stay home, rest and drink plenty of fluids. For others, especially those with certain medical conditions, the flu can be more severe.
   ""Some of the symptoms of the flu are very similar to those of a cold,"" said Cara Christ, chief medical officer for the Department of Health Services. ""Some people treat the flu like it's a cold and continue working. The truth is influenza can be fatal. If you suddenly feel sick, tired and begin coughing and sneezing, take care of yourself. Stay home and don't spread the virus to others. If you have a hard time breathing or have chest pains, you probably need to check with your doctor or get immediate help.""
   At this time of year, urgent care sites and hospitals are overcrowded with ill people so it is important to call your doctor first unless you are severely ill. The good news is if you haven't been sick yet, the flu shot can still offer you protection from flu. Simple, everyday prevention measures, like washing your hands, will help stop flu and other illnesses.
   ""Obviously, the best thing you can do to protect yourself and others is to get vaccinated. With our community reaching widespread status, this means that flu is circulating and even if you get vaccinated today, it will take 2-3 weeks to build up antibodies,"" said Bob England, director of the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. ""In the meantime, stay home when you are sick, wash your hands frequently and make sure to cough or sneeze into your sleeve. Simple, but tried and true public health practices.""
   While Arizona typically sees most of its flu cases in February or March, flu is unpredictable and can peak earlier or later in the season. This year, flu reports started early and have been increasing over the past few weeks, 824 cases of the 2,424 we've had this season were reported last week. However, because many people are not tested for the flu, those figures are just a fraction of the true number of cases.
   Arizona is not alone in this uptick of influenza - 40 other states reported widespread activity last week. The official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza season begins in October and carries through the following September.",,status,,2014-01-30 23:52:10,185,9,51,185,0,0,0,0,0

Opposition of same-sex marriage

Hello. My name is Kenard Dillon. I am of the Bitter Water Clan, born for the Apache Standing Rocks Clan. I was born, raised and educated on the Navajo Nation in Tuba City. I am 18 years old and currently in my first year of study at Harvard University, where I hope to concentrate in history or government.

Recently, I stumbled upon an article in The Albuquerque Journal, which highlighted the plethora of delegates to the Navajo Nation Council, including Speaker Johnny Naize, that oppose same-sex marriage under Navajo jurisdiction, in lieu of its recent legalization in New Mexico, on whose land the reservation stretches into.

Given the jurisdictional nightmare, I know that such unions are currently prohibited under a 2005 law, passed following an override of Joe Shirley's veto, and that for the most part it is a nonissue amongst tribal members. Although marriage equality itself is a complicated issue in the queer community and is not a priority for me personally, Speaker Naize's comments remain unacceptable. They are not only unsettling to me as a queer individual, but also completely unfounded to me as a Navajo.

Naize backed up his views with claims that such beliefs have always been part of Navajo culture and can be found woven into our traditional stories and religious dogma.

""The tradition with that says that the marriage has to be between a man and woman. That's how we respect our tradition,"" he said. He is wrong to declare such prohibition is respectful of our traditionsÑit is the opposite.

Under my own lens of understanding cultural tradition, atypical gender and sexual relations were never an issue for the Navajo, and his comments seemed flawed at best.

Our traditions as Diné people should be the parts of our culture that fill us with pride, not tools of prejudice used to discriminate against our own, which undoubtedly distorts and damages them.

Naize has his right to speak out on marriage equality, as a private citizen, but none whatsoever as a leader to hide behind tradition in attempt to justify legal discrimination on our reservation. It begs to question why someone with such ignorant views can be elected to tribal office.

Furthermore, if the Constitution and legal system of the United States guarantee ""equal justice under law,"" and our own cultural traditions promote equality for all beings, why then do current tribal laws reflect the opposite? Why do they betray our own cultural values?

For our pre-contact ancestors, who operated under a communal, socialist, libertarian and egalitarian system, this must seem abhorrent.

The views that the speaker and many contemporary Navajos hold are the byproduct of our ""civilization,"" ""Americanization,"" and ""Christianization"" by the United States government, which did nothing more than nearly annihilate us and our way of life, leading us into the present system of socioeconomic subjugation. What his comments and their context do, however, is shed light on more pervasive and hidden facets of the problems that remain inherent and entrenched in contemporary Navajo society -- inviting a much-needed discussion and reparation.

We can do so much better than this. I and other queer/LGBT Navajos deserve so much more than this vitriol coming from our leaders. Having grown up gay on the Navajo Nation, free of any pressure or harassment to conform to gender and sexual binaries, I am proud of my Navajo identity and the rich tradition that entails, but not the current complacency of my fellow Diné with regard to social issues.

By Shondiin Silversmith
Navajo Times 

   WINDOW ROCK — The Navajo Nation Transit System grounded six buses this past Friday due to contaminated fuel, but Department Manager Lee Bigwater said they should have all routes back in operation by Tuesday evening.
   ""We've been working on it all day. We got most of the vehicles back up. Fuel's been drained out and new fuel's been put back in,"" Bigwater said, adding that they don't know how the contamination happened but it involved someone pumping gasoline into the diesel-fueled buses.
   ""When (regular) gasoline goes into a diesel engine you know there is going to be a problem, especially in the fuel injectors. It might have burned them out,"" Bigwater explained. Once the department discovered the problem, he said, they drained the buses of the contaminated fuel and refueled with clean fuel. 
   ""Hopefully there are no major problems as we take off this evening along the routes,"" Bigwater added. They have also had the engines running just to make sure nothing is wrong.
   ""We should have all our routes back in operation by this evening,"" Bigwater said. Those routes include Route 4 — Crownpoint to Ft. Defiance; Route 7 — Newcomb to Ft. Defiance and Newcomb to Farmington to Shiprock; Route 9 — Dilkon to Ft. Defiance and Route 15 — Sanders to Window Rock to Gallup.
   ""We don't know what kind of damage has already been done to our fuel system in our buses,"" Bigwater said, adding that they're hoping nothing major has impacted their vehicles.
   Bigwater said the routes that were grounded are some of their popular routes because they cater to employees of the Navajo Nation. Concerned bus riders have been calling the office all day wondering about their rides. 
   ""The buses average about 40 seats. So that's a lot of people,"" Bigwater added.

By Quentin Jodie
Navajo Times
 

            WINDOW ROCK – After overcoming a number of hurdles, the Window Rock Scouts will be jumping ship when the Bee Ho'ldzil Fighting Scouts Center opens its door next Saturday.

            The $40 million dollar project took over 10 years to complete but the new 6,500-seat arena will replace the aging Veteran's Memorial Field House that was built in the 1950s.

            The new event center will contain six basketball goals, a state-of-the-art climate control system, a sports training center, a press box, and a wrestling room to house three large mats. More importantly, it will have four times the seating capacity as the old field house.

            But before the Scouts move into their new facility, they will play one more game tonight against the Tuba City Warriors in their legendary arena. And for good measure, this historic structure has hosted a number of classical games.

Thoreau, Wingate boys advance to championship game with big wins


By Quentin Jodie

Navajo Times

 

            FORT WINGATE, N.M. – After dramatic victories on Thursday, the Thoreau Hawks and the Wingate Bears turned up the defense at the right time as both squads advanced to the championship game of the Wingate Holiday Classic on Friday night.

            First it was Thoreau who tore apart Miyamura with its full-court press as they opened up an early 20-8 lead en route to an 81-67 win.

            Then, the Bears capped the night with a 72-40 victory over Hotsprings after leading the contest by only four points after one quarter of play.

            ""I am so happy with our team tonight,"" Wingate coach Al Martinez said. ""You always wish that these game are always going to go in your favor (every night) but they usually don't.""

            Martinez is expecting a tougher matchup with Thoreau in tonight's championship game since the Hawks have multiple weapons, which includes senior guard Shanton Yazzie and junior Alfred Smith III. Tipoff is scheduled for 6:00 p.m.
            ""We know Shanton real well and he spearheads that team real well,"" Martinez said. ""They have a lot of other parts as well. Alfred Smith does a real good job for them as well. They like to spread you out, ball handle and shoot that three.

            ""We have to counteract that with our inside game,"" he added. ""We got a couple of 6-3 guys and hopefully we can take advantage of that.""

            Thoreau coach Earvin Bennett said playing Wingate for the championship game is what they were hoping for.

            ""It'll be a great deal to come out with a W (on) Saturday night,"" Bennett said. ""We know Wingate very well and we know what they like to run so it should be a fun game.""

            Before that game, the Hot Springs Tigers and the Miyamura Patriots will battle for the third place trophy at 4:30 p.m.
            In the consolation bracket, the Tohatchi Cougars will take on Zuni at 1:00 in the seventh place game while Crownpoint and Rehoboth will play for the consolation championship at 3:00.

            In their game with Miyamura, the Hawks quickly jumped on them with a barrage of treys – all coming from Smith.

            Smith, who led all scorers with 32 points, credited Yazzie for allowing him to hit those open shots.

            ""When he started to penetrate inside, it left me open on the outside,"" Smith said of Yazzie. ""I just tried my best to make them.""

            The junior sharpshooter made six consecutive treys, which all came in the first half as he finished 20 points at the break. To add some perspective, he almost matched Miyamura's total as the Hawks led the Patriots 45-25 heading into the locker room.

            ""We made most of our shots and we controlled the ball a little bit better tonight,"" Smith said, while recalling their recent loss against Miyamura. ""We played better defense and we got some points off our press.""

            For much of the second half, the Hawks managed to keep margin around 20 points before Miyamura narrowed the gap down to 76-60 on a three-pointer by Josiah Reimonenq with 3:40 left to play.

            ""They (Miyamura) started to comeback on us,"" Bennett said. ""And you know coach (Matt) Vail did a good job tonight; he was missing two of his key players.""

            The Patriots had two players in double figures with senior post Anthony Lee leading the way with 21 points. Chandler Charles helped out with 10 while Jeremy Bill and Vince Begay added nine points apiece.

            For Thoreau, Yazzie finished with 17 points while Nathan Francisco chipped in 12.

            In Friday's finale, the Hot Springs Tigers played on even terms with Wingate until the Bears dictated the game with their defense in the last eight minutes of the first half.

            Wingate held the Tigers to only seven free throws in the second quarter while they lit the scoreboard with 20 points with seven different players scoring.

            With that the Bears extended a four-point lead into a 36-19 cushion at the break.

            ""I think it was mainly because of our defense,"" Wingate senior forward Kaycee Begay said of the turnaround.

            In the first quarter, Begay said they were sloppy on defense, which allowed Hot Springs to stay in the game.

            ""Every time they came down the court they would score on us,"" he said. ""We were not as active so I told the guys we had to play defense.""

            That pep talk seemed to work as the Bears held Hot Springs without a field goal for almost 14 minutes. After hitting an inside bucket with two minutes left in the first quarter, the Tigers didn't nailed their next one until Ryan Johnson got an open look inside with 4:24 to go in the third.

By Shondiin Silversmith
Navajo Times
 
WINDOW ROCK — As of today, it is legal for same-sex couples to get married in the state of New Mexico, but it's ruling still does not affect the Navajo Nation.
The New Mexico Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage Dec. 19 by declaring that it is unconstitutional to deny a marriage license to gay and lesbian couples. New Mexico joins 16 states and the District of Columbia in allowing the union of same-sex couples.
The ruling states, ""Prohibiting same-gender marriages is not substantially related to the governmental interests advanced by the parties opposing same-gender marriage or to the purposes we have identified. Therefore, barring individuals from marrying and depriving them of the rights, protections, and responsibilities of civil marriage solely because of their sexual orientation violates the Equal Protection Clause under Article II, Section 18 of the New Mexico Constitution.""
Amber Royster, executive director of Equality New Mexico said that the recent ruling might not be the silver bullet needed for everyone to have equal rights across the U.S., ""but it does put us at the table in an entirely different way.""
Equality New Mexico is a statewide Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender civil rights, advocacy and education organization.
""This is incredible for thousands of New Mexico families in the state, especially the more than 1,700 people who got married this year,"" Royster said, adding that the court's ruling ""made it crystal clear that our founding constitution grants that basic freedom to everyone.""
Well, except on the Navajo Nation, where the Diné Marriage Act, a tribal act signed into law on April 2005 bans same sex marriages. According to provisions in the Act, ""marriage between persons of the same sex is void and prohibited.""
Being that the Navajo Nation is a sovereign nation, the New Mexico Supreme Court's ruling has no effect on Navajo lands in the state of New Mexico.
But, that didn't stop New Mexican born Navajo Renaldo Chapman from celebrating today's passing with pride. Chapman has been married to his partner Demetrius Chapman for the past 5 years, and will celebrate six years on Dec. 21.
In fact, his first reaction when the news broke of the high court's ruling was taken to Facebook when he posted, ""OH HAPPY DAY!""
""I feel like I have dignity, my dignity has been restored because not only was my right's being suppressed by the state but also the Navajo Nation, which is still in effect, but the United States,"" Chapman said during a phone interview with the Times.
""New Mexico has affirmed human dignity, and all families of New Mexico are now protected by the fundamental right to marry,"" Chapman added.
Chapman, who now lives in Albuquerque with his family, said he is happy that ""the place I call home is where I can be protected and not fear for the safety of my family.""
""I would like to see this progression at some point reach the Navajo Nation government,"" Chapman added.
There is currently an effort in place in hopes of getting the Diné Marriage Act of 2005 changed on the Navajo Nation, and the person headlining that effort is Alray Nelson, founder of the Coalition for Navajo Equality.
""This ruling in favor of the freedom to marry in New Mexico is a clear message to our Navajo leaders that the Diné Marriage Act is wrong and a law of discrimination,"" Nelson said.
Nelson added that ""we can do better and the Navajo Nation will be on the right side of history when we repeal this discriminatory law. Love wins and we saw that today with this ruling for love, family, and equality in New Mexico.""
""There is an active effort in place, and given that such a significant portion of the Navajo Nation lands is in New Mexico, hopefully it will give that momentum to move forward,"" Royster said on how this ruling benefits the Navajo Nation, adding that Equality New Mexico supports the coalitions efforts.",,status,,2013-12-19 19:39:46,595,211,138,595,0,0,0,0,0

By Krista Allen
Western Agency Bureau



     PAGE, Ariz. − An explosion in the janitor's room at Page High School on Tuesday morning set fire to a portion of the main building, causing all four schools within the Page Unified School District as well as Tse'Yaato' High to close for the day.
     The explosion occurred around 4 a.m. and blew out the back doors, according the security tapes that the staff reviewed. 
     The Page Fire Department, however, has not determined the cause of the fire. 
     ""It exploded (the doors) open into the parking lot,"" said Page Unified School District Superintendent Jim Walker who received an emergency call at 4:30 a.m. ""Fortunately, our sprinkler system worked well and seemed to control the flames."" 
     Walker says the entire main building was filled with thick smoke. 
     ""We're really not sure how long we're going to be out of that building,"" said Walker. 
     Due to a mixture of particles and chemicals that might have been produced by incomplete burning of carbon-containing materials, Walker says he's not sure how long the main building (that contains administration and counseling offices, more than 20 classrooms, and student lockers) will be closed down, which prevents students and teaching staff from their lockers and classrooms. 
     ""We're making plans to relocated all those,"" said Walker. ""Just in case it ends up being a long-term issue."" 
     PUSD canceled all schools today and tomorrow for all students and faculty. Maintenance and custodial, though, will need to report for duty. 
     Page High School has a 75 percent American Indian population from neighboring communities including Bitter Springs, Bodaway-Gap, Cedar Ridge, LeChee, Kaibeto, Navajo Mountain, Shonto, Tonalea-Red Lake, and Ts'ah Bii Kin.

            FLAGSTAFF – The Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise (NNGE) in conjunction with Labatt Food Service and Navajo Nation leadership are celebrating the successful first year of the Navajo Beef Program.

            The program features local Navajo ranchers raising high quality beef, Labatt Food Service distributing it and NNGE purchasing it to serve in its resort, casinos and restaurants. Since its launch last November, the program has generated half a million dollars for Navajo ranchers and their communities.

            ""We are proud to be such an important part of the Navajo Beef Program's success, which is just one component of NNGE's larger commitment to buy Navajo,"" stated Derrick Watchman, CEO of NNGE. ""The Navajo Beef Program allows our properties to better showcase Navajo, provide world-class cuisine and generate revenue and jobs for the Navajo people.""

            To date, the Navajo Beef Program – through Navajo ranchers – has produced 545 head of cattle and generated more than $500,000 of revenue back into the local Navajo community.

            ""It has been a privilege to ensure the hard-working local ranchers receive the fair payment they deserve for this high quality beef,"" said Al Silva, chief operating officer of Labatt Food Service. ""We know the success of this program allows the ranchers to improve their lives and increase the quality of life in their communities.""

            Through the Navajo Beef Program ranchers – at Padres Mesa Ranch in Chambers Ariz., 14R in the New Lands area and Turquoise Grazers in Window Rock, Ariz. – uphold traditional practices to produce premium, quality beef that is always tender and full of flavor. Navajo Certified Beef is Choice grade or better and aged 21 days.

            Labatt Food Service, the tenth largest food distributor in the country, ensures the quality of the beef, that local Navajo ranchers receive fair payment and that the entire animal is used. The initial success of the program is motivating Labatt to expand the program for 2014.",,status,,2013-12-01 21:50:57,638,46,88,638,0,0,0,0,0

By Krista Allen 
Western Agency Bureau

   WESTERN NAVAJO AGENCY ‑ As the cold air remains, snow, ice, and drenching rains ‑ blamed for a number of slide-offs and fender benders ‑ have caused havoc within the western region of the Navajo Nation. 

     A strong winter storm system swept across Northern Arizona over the weekend, leaving a soggy mess.     

     Snow accumulations varied from three inches around LeChee to nearly 10 inches around Coppermine and Navajo Mountain, Utah, according to chapter officials on Sunday.  

    ""The wind's been blowing day and night,"" said Naatsis'áán Chapter Vice President Jaime Holgate, who's been plowing snow all day. ""Most (areas) have snowdrifts, anywhere from three to six feet deep."" 

     ""We've got (many) vehicles, mostly cars, that are stranded on the road,"" added Holgate.  

     In Ts'ah Bii Kin, just southeast of Navajo Mountain, where the elevation is more or less than 6,732 feet, the snow saturated the ground.

      ""Wet and white,"" said Ts'ah Bii Kin Chapter Vice President Geraldine Chee as she described the snow in her community. ""So it's kind of muddy.    San Juan Southern Paiute President May Preston says her people in Paiute Mountain (Naatsis'áán to the Diné) have been snowed in for at least three days.

     ""The roads are treacherous,"" said Preston, who also reported rain in the Paiute territory near Tuba City. 

     The storm, however, only brought rain to several communities including Kayenta, Tonalea-Red Lake, and Tónaneesdizí. 

     ""Roads are very muddy,"" said Tonalea-Red Lake Chapter President Darryl Jim. 

     It will be mostly sunny on Monday, according to the National Weather Service.

Jacoby Ellsbury is a World Series champion again.

For the second time in his professional baseball career the 30-year-old Navajo outfielder is part of another Boston Red Sox World Series championship team.
Ellsbury and the Red Sox won the title tonight when they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 6-1 at Fenway Park.
It is the first time since 1918 that the Red Sox have won a World Series title at Fenway.
The Red Sox finished the series 4-2.
Ellsbury lead the Boston off with a single to right at the bottom of the third. A double by Shane Victorino brought Ellsbury, David Ortiz and Jonny Gomes in for three runs to lead 3-0.
Ellsbury had another base hit to right at the bottom of the fourth and ran as far as second base. A single by Mike Napoli brought Ellsbury in for his second run of the game.
The soon-to-be free agent lit the stage at the bottom of the fifth when he tried to steal second. Ellsbury escaped a tag out four Cardinals players and got back to first base.
Ellsbury finished the game with five at-bats, three hits and a batting average of .296.

St. Louis ties the series, 1-1

By Sunnie Clahchischiligi 
Navajo Times Sports Writer

The St. Louis Cardinals tied the World Series up 1-1 with the Boston Red Sox as they took Game Two of the World series, defeating Boston 4-2 tonight at Fenway Park.

Red Sox's Jacoby Ellsbury once again contributed to the game. The centerfielder had a single in the third but was left on base without getting a chance to try score.

Ellsbury had 1 hit with 4 at-bat appearances. His batting average was .143 with a .250 OBP.

He struggled on defense in the 4th when he struggled with an off-the-wall catch with Cardinals' Matt Holliday hit a lead-off triple.

Ellsbury went on to make three big catches on defense and closed with a lead-off single to 2nd at the bottom of the 8th. 

the Red Sox travel to Cardinals country for Game Three on Saturday, Oct. 26. The first pitch will be at 6:07 p.m. MST. FOX will televise the game.",,status,,2013-10-24 22:49:27,216,7,5,216,0,0,0,0,0

By Antonio Ramirez

 
WINDOW ROCK - This morning a suspicious package was found outside of the prosecutor's office around 8:00 a.m. Wednesday, and another package was reported outside of Navajo Arts and Crafts around 12:20 p.m.
Both scenes have since been cleared and no bombs have been found.

The package outside the prosecutor's office was determined to be a hoax package around noon. It was describes as computer hardware duck taped together.

The package outside Navajo Arts and Crafts brought police officers to the area. However, since then officers have left.

About 270-300 people have been evacuated from the area surrounding the prosecutor's office. Including employees with the Department of Public Safety, Criminal Investigations Unit, Navajo Nation Window Rock Police, Window Rock District Court, Dispatch, and inmates at the jail.

Bomb squads from Arizona Department of Public Safety in Phoenix and New Mexico State Police were immediately contacted after the initial package was found. Flagstaff FBI agents are on the crime scene as well.

As a precautionary measure, traffic had previously been diverted off Window Rock Boulevard and through the NHA housing complexes. Outside the prosecutor's office there is a 1000-foot safety zone established by the officers.

   The Navajo emergency management officials said Monday they were comfortable with the situation in Crownpoint, indicating that the worst may be over as officials for Navajo Technical University spent Sunday and Monday cleaning after portions of the campus were flooded on Friday and Saturday.
   Navajo officials were still getting reports from various chapters throughout the reservation about the damage that was done last week by flooding and they are now in the process of trying to determine the cost of the flooding to the tribe and to the chapters.

BUSING COMPROMISE BETWEEN CCSD & GMCS

 A verbal compromise between Central Consolidated School District and Gallup McKinley County Schools was reached on Friday that could stop the bus pickup of students in Naschitti, N.M. attending GMCS public schools in Tohatchi, beginning Tuesday.
     The verbal agreement also could mean that GMCS continues the bus service of the already 45 or so students enrolled in the Tohatchi schools from Naschitti but with feeder route money, money that would paid to the parents to transport their kids to the county line.
     The agreement calls for these students to catch the bus at the San Juan-McKinley county line, which they had been doing during the first two weeks of school, before GMCS Superintendent Frank Chiapetti decided to bus students from Naschitti instead of them walking five miles to the bus stop for their safety.
The meeting also included the involvement and facilitation by Council delegate Jonathan Hale, Rep. Sandra Jeff, Rep. Sharon Clahchischiligi, Department of Dine Education Superintendent for Schools Andrew Tah, and Ferlin Clark, who was there on behalf of the New Mexico State Education Department and the State Indian Affairs Department.
     At the meeting on Friday, Chiapetti said if the Fort Defiance Agency Council approved a resolution recommending NMPED to resolve the bus boundary issue between both school districts, he would proceed and request the NMPED to interfere through the legal process.
GMCS has already gone through the state-tribal consultation process with the passage of resolutions from Naschitti Chapter, District 14 Council and the school board of DODE. Chiapetti added.
     Meanwhile over the weekend, the Fort Defiance Agency Council passed the resolution. The resolution also has supporting resolutions from Naschitti
Today at 6 p.m. the school board of GMCS is scheduled to meet and discuss the bus boundary issue and the verbal compromise that was reach on Friday between Chiapetti and Levinski.
     On Tuesday, the CCSD school board is also slated to meet and discuss the bus boundary issue and verbal agreement in Naschitti",,status,,2013-09-16 15:40:57,94,8,8,94,0,0,0,0,0

WINDOW ROCK – Hunters Point, Ariz., native Natasha Hardy was announced as winner of the 2013-2014 Miss Navajo Nation pageant.

Hardy, 24, won the crown Saturday evening in front of a large audience at the coronation ceremony, held in a tent behind the Navajo Arts and Crafts Enterprise, pageant sponsor.

""Oh, my gosh,"" exclaimed Hardy, as tears were streaming down her checks in her 10-minute acceptance speech. ""This is something else.""

 Hardy is the daughter of Katherine and Gerald Nez of Hunters Point, Ariz.

She is Kinyaa'aanii (Towering House Clan), born for Pima-Tachii'nii (Red Running into Water Clan). Her maternal grandfather is Hashk'aa Hadzoho (Yucca Fruit Clan), and her paternal grandfather is Naakai (Mexican Clan).

She is the eldest of four sisters, who include Ernestine Hardy, Sheridan Nez and Latisha Nez.

As Miss Navajo Nation, Hardy plans to revitalize the Navajo language and culture among all facets of Navajo society, particularly the youth, the future of the Navajo Nation.

""Please talk to your kids in Navajo,"" she said to the hundreds of pageant-goers in attendance.

In a close contest of eight contestants, Hardy beat out first runner-up Versheena Dempsey, of Lukachukai, Ariz., and second runner-up Lailauni Moore, of Wheatfields, Ariz.

The Miss Congeniality award went to Moore and the Best Essay award went to Brittany Hunt, of Shonto, Ariz.

Dempsey won the Best Butcher award, while Cherish Tso of Chinle won the Miss Photogenic award.

Hunt, Tso, Joni Pino, of Twin Lakes, N.M., Darian Isaac of Hard Rock, Ariz., and Wallita Begay, of Oljato, Utah, received honorable mention.
Hardy is the 61st Miss Navajo ever to win the coveted title, 61 years after the first Miss Navajo, Dr. Beulah Melvin Allen, won it in 1952.

147969681232_10151728173171233,"Monsoon rains close U.S. Highway 491, expected to open by Monday

By Alastair Lee Bitsoi
Navajo Times

                NASCHITTI, N.M. – Torrential monsoon rains have ""completely closed"" a portion of U.S. Highway 491, after runoff from the Chuska Mountains undermined a culvert with the force of the water ultimately creating a 10-feet-by-6-feet crevice across the roadway.

New Mexico Department of Transportation Officials, Navajo Nation Police and Newcomb Fire Department District 13 have been on scene, diverting traffic to alternative routes, including through U.S. Highway 371. U.S Highway 371 runs parallel to U.S. Highway 491 about 50 miles east of the closed highway between Bloomfield and Crownpoint, N.M.

                Locals call the site of the damaged road Stinky Water Wash, which is near Miles Post 44. Commuters driving through the corridor will be told to turn around to take the alternative route via U.S. 371. The road is closed off to northbound motorists in Naschitti, near the intersection of the Naschitti Cattle Auction and second turnoff to the community, and for southbound motorists, the road is closed by Mile Post 45, just south of Sheep Springs, N.M.

                Area folks told the Navajo Times that Friday evening when the storm struck there was heavy rain for about two hours with thunder and lightning. One local described the monsoon shower as ""pouring rain"" and ""a few minutes later you could hear the frogs croaking.""

                According to Delane Baros, management analyst for NMDOT District 6, state road department officials are working on creating a detour near the area of the collapsed road. She said that materials are currently being shipped to the area of the road disaster.

                ""It's amazing what water can do,"" she said, adding that the culvert under the roadway had collapsed because of the force of the gushing water lifted up the culvert and caused the road to fail.

                Baros cautioned motorists not to cross flash flooded areas on any part of any highway, adding that it's about their safety.

                ""Use caution and don't try to cross running water,"" she said. ""We don't know what's underneath and we just want to be safe.""

                One family of four, from Idaho, didn't use that caution, as evidenced by their damaged car. The family was transported to Northern Navajo Medical Center in Shiprock, according to Newcomb Fire Department Chief Michael Joe, after attempting to cross the damaged roadway Friday evening.

                In an interview with the Navajo Times, before a Shiprock District Police Officer asked the Navajo Times to step-away from what he dubbed a ""criminal scene,"" Joe said the family crossed the highway at a high rate of speed and obviously didn't know the damaged road had a 10-feet-by-6-feet ditch under the running water.

                Joe said the runoff caused the Idaho family's car to hydroplane away from the gushing water into the shoulder of the highway. Luckily, he said, the family didn't sustain any major injuries, but were taken by ambulance to Northern Navajo Medical Center.    

""Got to fix the whole thing before anyone can cross it,"" Joe said about the collapsed road.

                Asked when the road could become passable, Baros anticipates the road to be open by Sunday afternoon, and, if not, by Monday morning.

                ""When Monday comes around, they'll send out engineers to look at the structure,"" Baros said.

Baros explained that the site of the collapsed road was scheduled for repair incidentally on Monday, as part of U.S Highway 491's expansion into a four-lane highway.  Construction efforts are currently being concentrated on in this area of the road, from Sheep Springs to Naschitti, N.M.

Meanwhile, as the damaged road is detouring people through Crownpoint, locals have used backcountry roads to pass through the area.

And for those participating in the 34th Annual Narbona Pass Classic, which is scheduled for Sunday, organizer Chester Carl is recommending motorists to go through Window Rock and Fort Defiance on Indian Route 12/N.M. Highway 134 to get to Narbona Pass.

""Be safe and don't cross running water,"" Baros said. ""We hope to have it open tomorrow or Monday.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.150733941232.143880.147969681232/10151728173171233/?type=3,2013-07-06 19:44:34,597,101,535,597,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Łééchąą'í

Also shortened to just łééchąą', the Navajo word łééchąą'í refers to domesticated dogs.

This, like many other Navajo words, is intended to be an easy, yet unique, descriptor. So the entire word is saying, in not a vulgar sense, 'the pooping pet.' It is perhaps a remark on the relative lack of discretion on a typical dog's part when ""doing business.""",Łééchąą'í - Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/post/47714783008/leechaai,2013-04-17 10:40:31,74,12,10,74,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Át'ahálo

Át'ahálo is a Navajo expression that means ""wait!"" It's a way of saying, ""hold on"" or ""sit tight"" without needing the entire set of conjugated verbs for ""to wait.""

In speech, it is sometimes shortened to either át'ah or t'ahálo.

The word áłtsé also has a second meaning of ""wait"" but is primarily used to denote the first in a series of either nouns or actions. So both words can be used in the same sentence (e.g. ""Wait, we will eat first."").",,status,,2013-04-04 11:41:00,126,23,20,126,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Łitso

The Navajo word łitso is commonly translated directly as yellow. Whereas the English word is an adjective, in Navajo it is a state. So łitso, as with all other Navajo colors, operates as a verb.

This is why łitso comes at the end of statements. For example, ""Chidí éí łitso"" is the same thing as ""the car is yellow."" The word ""chidíłtsooí"" is ""the car that is yellow.""

A plural form of this word is daaltso - they (3rd person) are yellow - and is sometimes used instead of the actual thing they are describing. ""The yellow ones"" can refer, for instance, to the yellow m&ms if they are the only notable yellow objects around.

There is a similar word łitsxo. That extra 'x' forces the word to be pronounced with more force resulting in an amplification of sorts. In this case, it refers, more or less, to an intense yellow, or orange-colored.",Łitso - Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/post/46432245570/litso,2013-04-01 11:49:17,69,3,6,69,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Bą́ą́h ílį́

Bą́ą́h ílį́ is a Navajo expression that means ""it is worth"" or ""it costs"".

Together with díkwíí, which denotes a query, you can ask ""Díkwíí bą́ą́h ílį́?""  and you would be asking ""How much does this cost?"" or ""How much is this worth?""

Of course, this does not always apply to cost in terms of money. It can be used to denote the cost of a trade, as in ""It cost 14 (woven) rugs.""

Beyond bą́ą́h ílį́, there is also bą́ą́h azlį́į́' which is the past tense. (When I say past tense, I really mean 'perfective' - which is a way of saying the action was finished, perfected, or completed.) Bą́ą́h azlį́į́' means ""it will cost.""

Going the other direction in time is bą́ą́h adooleeł, or ""it will cost.""

Using béeso (money - dollars) as the currency, you can state a price:

Naakits'áadah béeso bą́ą́h ílį́. It costs 20 dollars.

Or, confirm a price using a conditional:

Da' dízdiin béeso bą́ą́h azlį́į́'? Did it cost 40 dollars?",Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2013-03-29 10:39:23,77,0,3,77,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo word of the day- Tóta'

Today's Navajo word is tóta', which means 'in between water'.

Tóta' is also the name for Farmington, New Mexico because the city is situated between bodies of water to its east, south, and west.

This word is made up of tó and -ta' (as in bita').

Tó, which was our word for October 23rd, means water.

The -ta' root is related to another word, bitah - without the abrupt glottal stop - which means 'among it'. Add the glottal stop and the word bita' becomes 'in between it (or them)'.",Tóta' - Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/post/45117216894/tota,2013-03-15 10:53:01,58,3,4,58,0,0,0,0,0

147969681232_587259001301838,"Navajo Word of the Day- Gah

The word gah in navajo means rabbit. Gahtsoh, or big rabbit, refers to a jackrabbit (which is actually a hare).
There are many stories about gah and mą'ii (coyote), especially when it comes to the latter hunting the former. In nearly all cases, gah continually taunts mą'ii and then proceeds to devise an escape if he is trapped.
In one instance, coyote was out all day trying to catch a rabbit for food. One rabbit decided to play with coyote, so he went out into the open where he would be seen. Coyote spotted him and immediately pursued rabbit all over. But rabbit was getting tired so he hopped right into a hole in the ground.
Coyote reached in as far as he could, all the while shouting that he was going to eat the rabbit. Rabbit, still playing with mą'ii, cried back, ""I'm going to die! You are going to eat me! How will you kill me?""
""By using a big stick! I'll twist your fur and pull you out that way!"" Coyote explained as he rushed away to find his stick. He came rushing back, plunging the stick into the hole in the ground. Rabbit was still having fun, though.
Every time, rabbit grabbed the stick and held on until coyote almost had him within reach. Then he would let go and coyote would tumble backwards. Coyote stopped after half a day of trying. Finally, rabbit shouted back, ""I'm going to die! You are going to eat me! How will you kill me?""
""I'll smoke you out of your hole with some pitch!"" Coyote replied. He rushed off and returned shortly with a pile of wood and some pitch. Arranging it all over the rabbit's burrow, he lit everything on fire. Rabbit cried out, ""You're killing me! Make it bigger!""
Coyote blew onto the fire and it grew, and still rabbit cried out, ""More! Make it hotter! I am almost dead!"" So coyote obliged and leaned in further towards the fire and blew harder to make it bigger. ""You're almost there!"" yelled rabbit over the flames.
Coyote was at last as close as he could get to the flames, blowing frantically to make it bigger. Rabbit finally said, ""There! You got it!"" and coyote's face perked up, anticipating rabbit's exit. Inside the burrow, rabbit quickly charged towards the coals, shooting out of the burrow and sending pieces of coal into coyote's face. Coyote cried out and rabbit got away.
This is how, they say, coyote got the dark spots on his face.

Ma'ii

The Navajo word ma'ii (or mą'ii) is the coyote. In some literature ma'ii is described as the ""Navajo trickster god"", which is a misnomer depending on how you look at it.

Coyote is certainly a cunning figure in Navajo tradition. But tricks are only one facet of ma'ii's character.

The ""god"" qualifier is less certain, mainly because ma'ii manifested as a physical being, but shared the knowledge of the spiritual beings (Diyin Dine'é - Holy People). If there were direct ""gods"" in Navajo tradition, they would have to be the purely spiritual figures that came before the First World.

Diné bahane' (the People's story) will sometimes say that Ma'ii was first in the form of a human, who found the wandering group of First Man and First Woman in prior worlds. This is where other names for Coyote come from, like First Thought, First Angry, and The All-Mover.

In Diné bahane', coyote's cunning way was put to use against the Black God (or Fire God or Black Man) - himself a kind of trickster - when he stole the way to make fire. (In Navajo tradition, Black, or darkness, borders and contains fire and heat. In this way, it was understood that the stars in the sky were made of fire. Black is also the color associated with Náhookǫs, the northern direction.)

Akin to Prometheus, and a host of other figures in the mythologies of other cultures, it's fair to say there's much more to Coyote than is popularly held.

The whole word náádamóo is saying ""next Sunday.""

Honeezílí & Honeesk'ází

In Navajo, there is a particle that denotes areas or spaces. The little prefix ho- indicates not an object, but a spacial concept which can be physical and figurative (""I have a space in my memory/heart, etc."").
If you take nizhóní and change it to hózhóní, you've now changed the meaning from ""it is beautiful"" to something like ""an area is beautiful/tranquil/clean/neat, etc."".
We've also used the word Hoozdoh (or Hoozdo) in describing Phoenix. It's a formation of ho- and sidó (meaning it is hot) to create the meaning ""the area that is hot"".
This leads to honeezílí, a similar formation of ho- and sizílí (meaning it/that object is warm/lukewarm). The resulting word refers to an area that is warm and, depending on the circumstances (like in the cold winter), sometimes a comfortable place.
On the other hand, we have honeesk'ází (also said hoozk'az) using the same spacial prefix combined sik'az (meaning an object is cold). In this case, the new word refers to an area or space that is cool.
So in short, they each mean this place or space is warm and this place or space is cool.",Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2013-03-01 13:30:57,74,3,12,74,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Nila

This is a Navajo saying that means ""it's up to you"" or ""you decide what will happen/be done"". ""You decide if you'll learn."" ""You decide how long to water the grass."" etc.

Generally, this is a way of way of making someone responsible for their own actions, and is a prevalent feature in a family unit.

Táá hó'ájit'éégóó is another way of saying this. You're most likely to hear this being used from parent to a child, or a leader to the people he serves, or in most cases where a person is being encouraged to make well-rounded decisions. 

Note: níláh, in the midst of frustration or irritation, can mean ""get away!"" or ""leave me alone"" - you'll have to take into account the high tones and the context",Nila - Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/post/42440177239/nila,2013-02-12 12:47:09,109,13,29,109,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Atsá Biyáázh

The great thing about today's word is that we've covered these terms before!
Remember the word yázhí - or ""little one""/""son""/""young""? As we explained in that post, another acceptable form of the word is yáázh. Couple that with the possessive identifier bi-, and you get biyáázh meaning ""her little one(s)"".
It may be confusing at first, but the possessive shi- / ni- / bi- (as in bicheii - his grandfather) is gender neutral. It can refer to any gender. In the case of yázhí, it refers to the mother (female), as mothers call their young yáázh.
Atsá comes from the list of birds we included in tsídii. It refers to the eagle.
So together we have ""eagle its(her)-baby"" in reference to eaglets. It's the Navajo name for the month of February, so named because eaglets have been known to hatch during this period.",Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2013-02-01 13:30:02,72,3,11,72,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo WOTD- Wááshindoon Aląąjį' Dahsidáhígíí

The Navajo word aląąjį' (also, alą́ąjį') is literally ""ahead"" or ""in front"" as in ""up in front.""
Wááshindoon is one word you've seen before (wáshindoon), and if you haven't, you can probably guess that it means Washington.
The last word can be broken down like this: dah + sidá(h) + ígíí. Dah, same one from a few days ago, means elevated or suspended. Sidá, from the same post as dah, means ""he is sitting down."" And -ígíí is an extended form of the -í nominalizer. It seems like this would be another word for chair, but it's not exactly the same. It's more ""he is the one that is sitting (elevated).""
Aląąjį' Dahsidáhígíí (also, Alą́ąjį' Dahsidáhí) together is a phrase that refers to a Chapter House President (any president actually, but you'd have to specify the organization). Since Chapter House Presidents actually sit in front, commonly on platforms, they inherit this description.
Now, Wááshindoon Aląąjį' Dahsidáhígíí is like specifying the Governmental President of Washington. And this, of course, is the President of the United States of America, currently President Obama.",Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2013-01-22 18:14:14,94,0,14,94,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo word of the day- Ayóó Ánííníshní

In Navajo, the word ayóó denotes the same as ""a lot"" in the English language. But it's not so much about quantity as it is about magnitude. ""Very"" is a good word, too.
Ánííníshní refers more literally to someone's regard for another. It's nearly the equivalent of ""I have a regard for you."" This verb needs context, and with this particular word, stands on its own.
Together, this phrase is understood to mean ""I love you"" or ""I adore you.""
It conveys the understanding that the person doesn't just have a regard for another, but a very high regard with much esteem.
Ayóó ánóshní is another commonly used phrase (some say it may be slang, others will say it's perfectly unadapted).",Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2013-01-18 14:53:23,117,3,32,117,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo word of the day- Ké Ntsaaí

Ké, which was featured in kélchí, is Navajo for shoe(s). (Kélchí referring specifically to mocassins.)
The second word ntsaaí (sometimes nitsaaí) is normally a verb that means (it) is large/huge/big.
If you're starting to get a hang of these verbs that become objects, you'll notice the -í at the end. That's the signal for ""the thing (that which is) large/huge/big.""
So together, the word is literally the big shoe.
But in Navajo, it's a distinct term for a woman's mocassins. These have similar soles that curve upward around the entire shoe, and the top of the foot covered with hide. Starting at the base of the heel and extending upward near the knee is a wrapping that covers a large portion of the shin. These are commonly white leather wrappings.",Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2013-01-16 15:05:41,89,2,4,89,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Bikáá'dah'asdáhí

Are you sitting down?
On a chair?
Call that chair, in Navajo, bikáá' dah asdáhí.
Try describing a chair, keeping in mind that the ""dah"" here is the same one we used for dah naat'a'í - flag.
Bikáá' is the Navajo word for describing the top of something, like its surface or on its top surface. Keep this word in mind because it's common in words like table and desk.
Dah we described as suspended, or elevated, at an upwards position (i.e. off the ground).
Asdáhí is a nominalized word for the act of sitting down (sidá - he sits down - uses the same verb root).
You're describing the chair as an object on the surface of which one sits at an elevated position.
There's also another word you can say for chair, and that's bik'idah'asdáhí. Bik'i meaning on it or upon it.",Navajo Word of the Day,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2013-01-15 17:37:55,128,16,17,128,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Ts'in

This word is remarkably similar to tsin (the Navajo word for tree or wood).

But you'll notice the glottal stop (the apostrophe) right there in the middle. Normal ts sounds like the ts in ""hats."" So tsin would be like saying ""hatsin"" without the initial ha. For ts' the pronunciation will need to be 'ejected', so to speak. Try saying ""hats"" ""in"" by pronouncing each word separately. Then, repeat those words and bring them closer together after each repetition. You should soon be saying ""hats'in"" with a distinct explosive ts'. It will feel like your tongue is doing a lot more work to push air out, and you'll notice your throat (glottis) close up momentarily as you transition from ""hats"" to ""in"". (Once you feel you've got it, just take away the ha and you've got ts'in.)

So now that you've got an idea of how to say it, what does it actually mean?

Whereas tsin means tree, ts'in is actually the Navajo word for bones. You can also say ats'in to mean ""a bone"", which is considered non-possessive. Replace the leading a- with shi-, ni- or bi- to create shits'in, nits'in or bits'in, which translate to my bone(s), your bone(s) and its/his/her bone(s), respectively.

Navajo Word of the Day- Dééh

The Navajo word dééh refers to tea, or Navajo (or Hopi) tea, in English.

The tea plant is abundant wherever there is a good source of water, which commonly includes the runoff areas from roads during monsoon season. The tea plant has wiry stalks and stems, and small yellow flowers at the tops. It grows about knee height and lower.

These plants are collected and bundled to a size about as thick as a broom handle, and about as tall as a soda can. Boil these bundles in water and you have Navajo tea.

Another word for tea is ch'il ahwééh, which is like saying ""plant coffee.""",navajowotd,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2012-11-05 15:49:12,53,5,5,53,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Times Reporter- Shondiin Silversmith

I started my reporting career in the spring of 2010 at the college newspaper at the University of New Mexico-Gallup. And since August, I have been the entertainment, arts and culture, and education reporter for the Navajo Times. How I got involved with journalism was quick and instinctive, but I love it. My first real reporting job was with the Daily Times in Farmington, N.M. as an intern for the summer of 2010. It was an amazing experience that allowed me to grow as a writer, and meet wonderful interesting people. In the summers of 2011 and 2012, I worked as a student intern for the Navajo Times. It's been an interesting experience and I love what I do. I cover a wide range of stories, from horse trainers and UFO festivals to artists and musicians. I enjoy writing; it's something that I have always wanted to do. It takes a lot of practice and I am still learning.",,status,,2012-11-02 09:26:44,168,16,3,168,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Bilasáana

The Navajo word bilasáana refers to the apple in English.

The origin of the word is not concrete, but it is thought to be an adaption of the Spanish word manzana. It's remarkably similar to the Navajo word bilagáana, which is also thought to be of Spanish origin.

Following yesterday's examples for tó, you could say bilasáana bitoo' to refer to apple juice. Yum.",navajowotd,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2012-10-29 12:17:29,53,4,6,53,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Shił łikan

The Navajo words shił łikan together mean roughly ""…it tastes good to me"" or ""I like it"" in reference to something that you eat or drink.

The first word, shił, translates to ""with me"" and is used to point the word it precedes towards an individual or group. Other words like this include nił (""with you""), bił (""with him/her/it""), and nihił (""with us"" or ""with you two/three/etc.""). 

Otherwise, the word łikan alone would simply mean sweet, tasty, or palatable without any indication of who experiences the sensation.

You could say, ""Bilasáana bitoo' éí shił łikan."" (In Navajo, éí is a filler word, like the English um or uh, and not at all frowned upon).",navajowotd,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2012-10-26 14:01:31,39,2,2,39,0,0,0,0,0

The Navajo word tádídíín is the word for corn pollen.

Tádídíín is a fundamental aspect of Navajo traditional culture. It comes from the tassels of a mature corn plant, and can only be collected by a female.

It is then blessed and used by all as the primary means of communicating with the Navajo Holy People. It is a conduit through which safety and happiness are assured, especially when one travels beyond the Navajo homeland (Dinétah).

It is a sweet-tasting yellow-colored powder that is commonly kept in small leather pouches.",navajowotd,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2012-10-23 13:09:39,68,0,7,68,0,0,0,0,0

Navajo Word of the Day- Na'azhǫǫsh

Na'azhǫǫsh is the Navajo name for a game that involves a hoop and stick, and in modern usage refers to gambling or a casino.

In Navajo tradition, the game was well known among the many people of the old world. It is often said that Coyote was once very beautiful, with a lustrous coat of fur. But he lost a game of na'azhǫǫsh to the otters, in which he bet his skin. It was replaced with the coat like the badgers, which was rough and coarse.

Now, with the construction of multiple casino facilities around the Navajo Nation, the game is symbolic of the gamblers who played it. The Twin Arrows casino, which is yet to be completed, between Winslow, AZ and Flagstaff, AZ is one such Navajo casino.",navajowotd,link,http://navajowotd.com/,2012-10-12 12:19:36,32,2,1,32,0,0,0,0,0

This is a Navajo word adapted from the word ""Washington"" that signifies the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the US Federal Government in general.

In a more broad sense, it can also signify a capitol, as in the place of government. This is what is meant by ""biwáshindoon"" (it's ""Washington"").

Navajo Word of the Day- Łigai

We hope you had a good Labor Day Weekend!

A few days ago we featured the Navajo name for Monument Valley, or Tsé Bii' Ndzisgaii. Notice the very last part of that word, -gaii. It's the part that references today's word.

Łigai, or łigaii (because the 'ai' and 'aii' diphthongs sound nearly identical), is the Navajo word for the color white.

White is part of the four cardinal colors of the Navajo people, symbolizing the sunrise and the eastern direction.

There's also the word 'dalgai (dalgaii, or daalgai, or daalgaii)' that pluralizes the white aspect. So conversationally it would be equivalent to something like, ""[go pick up those] white things.""

Navajo Word of the Day- Naaldlooshii

Now that you're familiar with ch'osh, today we're introducing the Navajo word for 'animal.'

The core part of the word, naaldloosh, translates roughly to English as ""(it) walks around/about."" Inside that word is -dloo- which can indicate the act of walking.

As a general term, naaldlooshii refers to things that walk around on four legs. But, in some cases humans are spoken of as being a part of that sphere — we need a lot of the same things, like food, water, and shelter, in order to carry on.

Navajo Word of the Day- Wah

Perhaps one of the most enigmatic words to non-speakers of Navajo, wah (or in some cases, wah-hah) is not so much a word as it is an expression.

The English counterpart would probably be ""oops"" when the speaker is talking about himself/herself. If the speaker is referring to others, it may be more of a jab at their clumsiness or failed attempt at doing something.

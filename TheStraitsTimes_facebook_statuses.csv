129011692114_10151510796947115,"Once-in-a-lifetime shot: AFP's Olivier Morin - who took this photo on Aug 11 during the 2013 IAAF World Championships in Moscow - wrote in the AFP's Correspondent's Blog: ""I took this picture with one of five remote-controlled cameras I'd set up by the side of the track to capture the race winner from various angles and perspectives. Of course, I didn't know for sure who'd win, but when I was setting up the gear it seemed like a fair bet to focus on Usain Bolt's lane!

""The remote-controlled camera that took this picture was the fifth of my rig, set pretty far back, about 30 metres, from the finish line. The idea was to make a photo of the winner with his arms raised and with the stadium in the background, as well as capturing a little bit of the sky. I was thinking more along the lines of an enduring feature photograph, rather than your typical news shot. 

""When Bolt did win, he seemed somewhat unemotional as he crossed the finish line, only really reacting a moment later. Still, I of course fired all of my cameras – the one in my hands and the remote-controlled devices that can be operated with a foot switch. 

""My hand-held shots are transmitted directly to AFP's photo editors, while those from the remote-controlled device go straight to my laptop. I started looking through these images one at a time – there were a few decent shots on the first four cameras. Then I opened up the pictures from the final camera.""

He went on to explain more of his craft in his blog. But Morin capped off saying: ""This was, I think, a once-in-a-lifetime moment. In my 25 years as a photographer I've never had an uncontrollable external element make a photo like this, and I imagine if I tried again for a similar result for the next 50 years, it wouldn't happen again. So, I only really give myself credit for one percent of this picture!""

He benefits after Lewis Hamilton was forced to retire due to a mechanical failure in his McLaren.

Here are the podium finishers: 
1. Vettel (Red Bull) 
2. Button (McLaren)
3. Alonso (Ferrari)

But the biggest winner here will probably be Fernando Alonso, who extends his lead on the driver's championship.

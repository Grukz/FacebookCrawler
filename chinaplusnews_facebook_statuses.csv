For students too young to climb the ladder, the village has started a preschool education class.

For instance, the tiny yellow rooster dough figurine held in Arabella's hand, that could be edible. And yes, it is vegetarian.

The Wednesday event was jointly hosted by the Chinese Embassy to the United States and the Meridian International Center, the latter had put in years of efforts to promote people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S.

Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai took the occasion to call for cooperation between China and the US in the face of difficulties and challenges:

""Over these decades, we have learned that we should always respond to difficulties and challenges by cooperation, instead of conflict or confrontation; that we should fully respect concerns of each other and never challenge the core interest of the other side; and that we should work together for win-win cooperation, instead of being misguided by zero-sum or cold war mentality.""

""China loves peace and safeguards peace. We object to any and all attempts to sabotage world peace and stability. China seeks win-win cooperation in the international community and rejects self-enrichment at the cost of others. China is open to the world and is willing to make greater contribution to the common welfare of humanity, but will never condone infringement upon its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We do not make trouble but we have no fear of trouble. We pursue friendship and cooperation, but balk not in face of threats and provocations. Through blood and sacrifice, the Chinese people fought hard for liberation and strove relentlessly for prosperity. And with the same tenacity we will achieve national rejuvenation in spite of all obstacles. Where there is a will, there is a way. We are certain to create a better tomorrow.""

Cui Tiankai says China and US can not and should not stray from the path of cooperation. Both members of the UN Security Council now constitute the two largest economies in the world, and therefore it behooves them to cooperate to the benefit of both their peoples and that of the international community.

Cui's comments come just a few days after the inauguration of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, who after winning in the general election had made some high-profile remarks about China that some fear could lead to a trade war.

However, Cui Tiankai suggests China and US should work together to create a powerful boost for the recovery of the world economy, instead of fighting a trade war that benefits none but hurts the world economy at large.

Cui also addressed the misconception about rule-making in international trade, saying the rules are not dictated either by the US or by China but instead must be created and observed by various countries in the world together.

Cui says China looks forward to continuing and improving the communication mechanisms between Beijing and Washington DC once the Trump administration moves beyond the transition period.

Today's show is not the cubes' debut. 

Earlier this month, their collective photo has been selected as ""best picture of the year 2016"" by media outlets including Reuters, Time, and The Atlantic Monthly.

Before the advent of Beijing Opera, Kunqu opera was the most prominent form. However, Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty was not content with this old style.
That's when Beijing Opera came into being, which had drawn many elements and aesthetic principles from various local operas across China.
Beijing Opera has four major roles: Sheng, Dan, Jing and Chou. Sheng is the main male role while Dan refers to female role. Jing is the male role with face-paint, and Chou not only has face-paint but also with a small patch of white chalk around the nose.
The renowned Beijing Opera artist Mei Lanfang was famous for his Dan portrayals, which is actually a female role.
He was one of the greatest popularizes of the opera abroad in the 1920s.

Meet Fang Shuyun, the man who has mastered the skill of floating on the river using a pair of moso bamboo.

Photos of Fang drifting on Fuchun River in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province, went viral recently, with many people relating the scene to the legendary Qinggong – a technique in China's martial arts novels whose master could glide on water surface using his power.

With the help of two seven-meter-long bamboo poles, the 51-year-old Hangzhou local surfed hundreds of meters at a speed of 30 to 50 meters a minute in front of reporters from Zhejiang Online.

Fang first tried the stunt in 2014 when he missed his ride home one evening and discovered a bamboo shoot floating on the river by accident. Naturally, he fell into water the first time, but he continued to practice until he managed to balance his 1.7-meter-tall, 55-kilogram body on the slippery bamboo.

Chinese folk singer Sa Dingding accidentally revealed she was lip-syncing instead of singing during a televised concert by brandishing her microphone the wrong way around.

A short video clip of the performance has gone viral on the Internet.

The video shows that Sa opened the song with a section of dance, and when she began singing, she suddenly realized she was holding her microphone upside down.

Then Sa smiled sheepishly as she quickly corrected her mistake before carrying on with her performance as if nothing had happened.

After the broadcast ended, Sa mocked herself on Weibo, telling her 1.6 million followers: 'Next time I'll sharpen up my acting skills'.

""When you make a spurt towards the summit, you go forward with hope, but when you fall down from the summit, what you get is rebirth."" Ding wrote this sentence as her signature on social media. In 2008, she started to learn the magic trick of releasing pigeons.

Andres Moreno, 38, died of a heart attack and peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining) in Ciudad Obregon, in northern Sonora state, his family said.

Moreno, who at one time tipped the scales at 450 kilos, had bariatric surgery on Oct. 28, in central Guadalajara, Jalisco state in midwestern Mexico, in hopes of shedding the excess weight and leading a normal life.

The surgery involved removing three-fourths of his stomach and reshaping what was left into a tube to ""prevent him from eating too much,"" the Medical Daily reported in October.

While the operation was considered a success, the ex-policeman complained of feeling ill on Christmas Eve, ""and his family called on firefighters to help stabilize him,"" state news agency Notimex reported.

Early Christmas Day, he was having difficulty breathing and family members decided to have him taken to the hospital in an ambulance, but he died on the way.

The ""Most Obese Man in the World"" had shed 100 kilos to be able to undergo the surgical procedure in October.

""The Paris Climate Conference is a crucial point in the global climate governance process. The outcome has a bearing with the undertaking of climate change of the human being and our future of sustainable development,"" China's Special Representative on Climate Change Xie Zhenhua said after the adoption of the Paris agreement.

Xie stressed that China, as a responsible developing country, will take international obligations commensurate with its own national condition, development stage and actual capacity.

""Although the agreement is not perfect, it does not stop us from moving a historical step forwards,"" Xie said, calling on developed countries to abide by their promises to provide finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building to developing countries.

""China is willing to work together with all Parties, in accordance with the principles of the UNFCCC, towards implementing the Paris Agreement and establishing a global climate governance system for win-win cooperation,"" Xie affirmed.

""For the first time, every country in the world has pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and join in common cause to take climate action,"" Ban said, adding that ""the Paris agreement demonstrates solidarity.""

""You have concluded not just any agreement, it is an ambitious, universal and legally binding agreement,"" French President Francois Hollande told the ministers and negotiators from the 196 Parties of the UNFCCC.

""There is no progress with risks, no progress without ordeals. History is written by those who engage, not by those who calculate,"" he added.

The French head of state also promised that ""France will put everything in place to implement the agreement.""

""This agreement, we had been waiting for a long time, for 40 years,"" Hollande said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sees the Paris agreement as ""a victory for all the planet and the future generations"".

For the executive secretary of the UNFCCC Christiana Figueres, ""It is an agreement of conviction, of solidarity, of long term vision.""

The Paris agreement runs to 32 pages with 29 articles, including objective, mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support.

On the basis of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, the Paris agreement calls for aiming to hold global average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and strives for limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Taking into account of the needs and priorities of developing countries, the agreement also eyes 100 billion U.S. dollars a year by developed countries for developing countries from 2020.

The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC kicked off on Nov. 30, 2015.

Shortly after the adoption of the climate pact, U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday called the Paris agreement ""a turning point for the world,"" saying it had created an ""enduring framework"" for future efforts.

Meanwhile in Europe, the Finnish government praised the climate change agreement, while Finnish environmentalists emphasized the challenges remaining.

Finnish Minister for the Environment Kimmo Tiilikainen described the Paris agreement as ""a turning point"", but noted that it is not perfect.

Over the past 40 years, cooperation between China and Malaysia has set a good example of friendly exchanges between countries in the region, Li said in a signed article published Friday by major Malaysian newspapers ahead of his trip to the Southeast Asian nation. Last year marked the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

""I am no stranger to this beautiful country, as I visited Malaysia in 1996 when the Twin Towers of Kuala Lumpur were just completed,"" Li said, noting that Malaysia has witnessed impressive and admirable achievements in the past two decades.

Hailing the achievements China and Malaysia have made in interactions in politics, economy and people-to-people exchanges, he said the two countries' development strategies have much in common.

Li noted that as China is advancing the Belt and Road Initiative, encouraging mass entrepreneurship and innovation, and transforming and upgrading its economic structure, Malaysia is also gearing toward all-round economic transformation with the New Economic Model aimed at more robust growth.

""I see this as offering each other a perfect opportunity to boost development,"" he said.

He called on China and Malaysia to draw on their respective strengths and conduct more cooperation on production capacity.

""We may encourage more enterprises to take part in the development of the industrial parks in Qinzhou and Kuantan, enhance infrastructure building and increase connectivity,"" Li said. ""Such cooperation will produce huge development dividends to ensure steady growth and make life better for our people.""

Meanwhile, the Chinese premier said both China and Malaysia have a major role to play in turning East Asia a major pole sustaining steady global growth, adding that China-ASEAN relations are a major cornerstone for peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region.

When talking about the upcoming East Asia leaders' meetings, Li said, ""Ours is a time with interwoven traditional and non-traditional security challenges, on top of which external interference has led to incessant turbulences in some parts of the world and caused serious spillover effects.""

Countries in the region should cherish the harmonious coexistence of different cultures and development paths, and work together to uphold regional peace and stability for the long run, he said.

In the article, Li also spoke of the story about Zheng He, a Chinese navigator during the Ming Dynasty (the 14-17th century) who came to Malacca for five times on his seven sea voyages.

Zheng's dedication to peace and his readiness to reach out and help others show the very essence of the Chinese philosophy, where peace and good-neighborliness always come first, he said.

Before concluding his visit to the United Kingdom, Chinese President Xi Jinping enjoyed a day out at the English Premier League powerhouse Manchester City Football Club. 

President Xi Jinping was welcomed at the Man City Football Club by Prime Minister David Cameron and club chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak. 

They toured the Manchester City Football Academy and enjoyed an exhibition at the National Football Museum, which houses artifacts including a ball used in the final of the inaugural 1930 World Cup. 

Xi Jinping and Cameron have also posed for a ""selfie"" picture with Sergio Aguero, Man City's Argentinian star striker. 
A highlight of the visit was the inclusion into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame of former Man City player Sun Jihai, the first Chinese player to score in the Premier League. 

President Xi is a well-known football fan. 

In 2011, he outlined his three wishes for China's football program -- to qualify for another World Cup, to host a World Cup, and to win a World Cup championship. 

While China has yet to achieve those goals, a profound reform program is underway in the country. 

The President says China has much more to learn from Britain, which he describes as the headwater of modern football. 

Interim mayor of Greater Manchester Tony Lloyd says he believes football cooperation between the two countries will be a win-win. 

""Given the development of China football strategy which President Xi particularly oversaw and his personal ambition of for the Chinese National Team and the development of China as a strong football nation with enthusiasms from the grass roots to the professional level, it is a very exciting time. And what better partner could you choose than the UK? The English Premier League is the most successful league in the country and there's a lot we can learn from each other. So I think it's a win-win. "" 

Chinese overseas student Liu Yang, who has come to welcome the Chinese President as part of Manchester's local Chinese community, says that building a football-loving culture is a crucial part of the sports' development. 

""The UK has much experience and skills that we could learn from. I know President Xi is a football fan himself, I hope he can share his enthusiasm about football with the general public. If the leader of a nation can be a football fan, why can't the people be football fans too? I believe that as long as there is aspiration, there will be progress, no matter if it's in professional football or just a love of the sport.""

Sharing one umbrella in typical London rain, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Britain's Prince William viewed a James Bond sports car from Britain's iconic automaker Aston Martin that will be equipped with an entertainment system with Chinese technology.

The visiting Chinese leader and his wife, Peng Liyuan, joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Wednesday morning at a creative industry event at Lancaster House celebrating cultural collaboration between China and Britain.

""China and Britain are both cultural powers. We should enhance creative cultural exchanges and improve mutual understanding between our two peoples through cultural products,"" said the president during a warm conversation with Prince William.

The Creative Collaboration Showcase demonstrates how the two countries are working increasingly together in the creative sector, sharing knowledge and expertise, and forming partnerships that benefit and enrich both markets and economies.

Aston Martin, a British car brand best known for its association with James Bond, is turning to China for additional technology for its super cars by forging a cooperative relationship with Chinese online entertainment company LeTV.

""We are working on some advanced engineering with LeTV to put their TV technology into our car,"" Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer told Xinhua at Lancaster House.

Stopping by the booth of Chinese auto company BYD, the two couples learned that London's famous red double-decker bus now has a Chinese designer and producer.

BYD has transformed London's traditional cultural icon into the first purpose-built, emission-free double-decker in the world. And later this year, London will become the first city to operate them.

A growing number of Chinese companies and individuals are seeing Britain as an innovation hub, and there has been cooperation between the two countries' film, television and gaming industries.

While Sherlock, Downton Abbey and James Bond have enchanted many Chinese, British museums and leisure attractions are taking their first steps into the Chinese market. The Victoria and Albert Museum has joined the construction of a new design museum in Shenzhen, China, and Merlin Entertainments is planning theme parks across China.

Chinese cultural success is firmly established in Britain, with music stars such as Sa Dingding and fashion houses such as Shanghai Tang gaining popularity in the European country.

At Lancaster House, Xi and Peng, with William and Kate, also watched a presentation of a documentary about Confucius jointly produced by Chinese and British moviemakers.

Xi's ongoing state visit to Britain ""reinforces the strong ties between our two countries and provides the opportunity to increase our close cultural, economic and diplomatic relations,"" said David Puttnam, a British film producer and educator.

He said he believes that there is much for China and Britain to learn from their distinctive cultural and business strengths.

Earlier Wednesday, Xi and Peng visited Data Science Institute and the Hamlyn Center at the prestigious Imperial College London, accompanied by Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer.

223495844457800_600612893412758,"Differences between Chinese and British Table Manners

China is a country of courtesy and propriety. Since ancient times, Chinese people have quite valued ritual and ceremonies. Similarly, the British are rather particular about table manners. What are the differences between Chinese and British table manners? Let's take a look.

Tableware and seat arrangement

Firstly, Chinese people have chopsticks, bowls (for rice and food) and spoons (for soup). British people use knives, forks and spoons. 

Secondly, Chinese people like sitting around a round table. Dishes are placed in the center and everyone shares, in order to create an atmosphere of unity and happiness.

However, British people prefer a long table. They have their own share of food placed on their plate, which displays individualism that is prevalent in Western cultures.

Thirdly, in China, the seat facing the door is normally considered the best place, and senior people or people of higher social status are often assigned to this seat of honor. It is customary to arrange seats according to social rank and seniority. Table setting also follows the rules: right is honor and left is low; and the middle seat is senior.

While in Britain, a rectangular table is preferred at a formal banquet. British people also consider that right is honor and left is low. They adopt the rule of ""ladies first"" in seat arrangement. Couples usually sit separately. Men and women are alternately seated.

The order of dishes 

A typical Chinese meal consists of:
Cold dishes
Main courses
The starchy staple food
Fruit

A typical British meal consists of:
Appetizer
Entree 
Dessert

Eating Etiquette
In China, what may surprise foreigners a lot is that some of the Chinese hosts like to put food into the plates of their guests. This is a sign of genuine friendship and politeness. 

Drinks play an important role in Chinese food culture. It is customary for the host to pour for the guests and always make sure everyone's glass is filled. Therefore, refusal by the guests should be made with utmost politeness.

However, British people do not act as enthusiastically and courteously as the Chinese when they have a banquet. Westerners pay more attention to personal freedom and relaxation.

Of course, both parties make toasts to create a friendly atmosphere. Chinese people say ""gan bei""(Bottoms up!), which means you should finish the whole glass to show your politeness, but British people can simply take a sip when they say ""Cheers!""

Dishes are often over-ordered in China because it is a way for hosts to show their generosity. Guests don't need to finish all the food on their plates, but in Britain, food is usually completed finished.

In Britain, going Dutch is the preferred choice when eating out, but in China, hosts pay for the meal. If you want to reciprocate the hospitality, you can pay next time!

Cultural roots

Chinese and western table manners have so many differences because they are deeply rooted in their cultures. Chinese table manners are the product of an agricultural society, reflecting collectivism and unity. In contrast, western table manners are the outcome of an industrialized civilization, valuing individualism and independence.",Chinese and British Table Manners,video,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/videos/600612893412758/,2015-10-20 08:50:00,83,2,22,83,0,0,0,0,0

We have compiled a list of his artistic heroes from the UK (mostly writers, one painter) for your convenience. #XiUKVisit

Geoffrey Chaucer
Known as the Father of English literature, Chaucer is widely considered the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages and was the first poet to be buried in Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey.

Chaucer is best known today for The Canterbury Tales. His other works include The Book of the Duchess, the House of Fame, the Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde.

William Shakespeare
William Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.

His signature plays include A Midsummer Night's Dream, Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth.

John Milton
John Milton was an English poet best known for his epic poem Paradise Lost (1667), written in blank verse.

William Hayley's 1796 biography called Milton the ""greatest English author,"" and Milton remains generally regarded as one of the preeminent writers in the English language.

George Gordon Byron
George Gordon Byron was an English poet and a leading figure in the Romantic Movement. Among Byron's best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, and the short lyric She Walks in Beauty.

Commonly known simply as Lord Byron, he is regarded as one of the greatest British poets, and remains widely read and influential to this day.

Percy Bysshe Shelley
Percy Bysshe Shelley was one of the major English Romantic poets, and is best known for such classic poems as Ozymandias, Ode to the West Wind, To a Skylark, Music, When Soft Voices Die, The Cloud and The Masque of Anarchy. 

His other major works include a groundbreaking verse drama The Cenci and long, visionary poems such as Queen Mab (later reworked as The Daemon of the World), Alastor, The Revolt of Islam, Adonaïs, and Prometheus Unbound.

John Keats
John Keats was an English Romantic poet. Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets.

The poetry of Keats is characterized by sensual imagery, most notably in the series of odes. Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analyzed in English literature.

Charles Dickens
Charles Dickens was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.

His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted. His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction.

Thomas Hardy
Thomas Hardy was an English novelist and poet. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, he initially gained fame as the author of novels, including Far from the Madding Crowd, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Tess of the d'Urbervilles, and Jude the Obscure.

Hardy's poetry, though prolific, was not as well received during his lifetime. It was rediscovered in the 1950s, when Hardy's poetry had a significant influence on the Movement poets of the 1950s and 1960s.

George Bernard Shaw
George Bernard Shaw was an Irish playwright who became the leading comedy dramatist of his generation and one of the most important playwrights in the English language since the 17th century. He wrote more than 60 plays, among them Man and Superman, Mrs. Warren's Profession, Major Barbara, Saint Joan, Caesar and Cleopatra, and Pygmalion. Shaw 

Shaw is the only person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize (Literature, 1925) and an Academy Award (Best Adapted Screenplay, 1938), the former for his contributions to literature and the latter for his film adaptation of his most popular play, Pygmalion. Shaw refused all other awards and honors, including the offer of a knighthood.

Joseph Mallord William Turner
Joseph Mallord William Turner was an English Romanticist landscape painter. Turner was considered a controversial figure in his day, but is now regarded as the artist who elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivaling history painting.

Although renowned for his oil paintings, Turner is also one of the greatest masters of British watercolor landscape painting. He is commonly known as ""the painter of light"" and his work is regarded as a Romantic preface to Impressionism.",Xi Jinping's Favorite British Artists,video,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/videos/600344143439633/,2015-10-19 02:31:46,144,1,33,144,0,0,0,0,0

How many people travel between China and the United States each year? More than four million!
Most of these travelers can benefit from the new reciprocal visa deal agreed by the two countries in November 2014. Secretary of state John Kerry personally issued the first batch of 10-year visas to 11 Chinese nationals at the US embassy in Beijing.

""This will pay huge dividends for American and Chinese citizens and it will strengthen both of our economies.""

Meanwhile, at the Chinese embassy in Washington DC, Yale University researcher Edmund Downie became the first American to receive a 10-year Chinese visa.

""It really makes things simpler, and I think it's a really good start for good cooperation between the two countries.""

According to the White House, by 2021, up to 7.3 million Chinese travelers will visit the US, making an annual contribution of 85 billion us dollars to the economy.

223495844457800_593854160755298,"Q&A with Zhou Xiaoming, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Chinese Permanent Mission to the UN Office in Geneva

(TY = Tu Yun, CRI reporter who interviewed Zhou Xiaoming
ZXM = Zhou Xiaoming)

TY: First of all, this will be the first time for President Xi to take part in the United Nations General Assembly's annual gathering. What message is the President going to deliver there?

ZXM: I think Mr Xi will tell China's visions for two important, very important issues for the UN, and indeed, to the world. One vision for international relations. A new type of international relations based on win-win cooperation. President Xi rejects the notion [of] winner-takes-all. Instead, he champions a community of shared future for mankind. At the UN, President Xi will outline the path towards that great goal. The second reason concerns international development, global development. He calls for habitable, open, all-round, innovation-driven development. To back up China's vision, President Xi will put forward new initiatives for greater international development cooperation. He will also map out an action plan for deepening south-south cooperation.

TY: You mentioned this development plan. I understand that world leaders are scheduled to debate on the sustainable development goals, also known as SDGs – the successor to the millennium development goals, known as MDGs, which aimed to eradicate extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, provide quality education to all, and achieve economic growth while ensuring environmental sustainability. So, generally speaking, how has China been doing in reaching the MDGs which were set by the UN in 2000 with a deadline of this year?

ZXM: China has been a superstar in achieving the eight targets of MDGs. But China actually is the first country to achieve the target of reducing the number of people suffering from hunger and poverty by half. The very first country – ahead of schedule, actually. Between 1990 to 2005, more than 470 million people in China were lifted out of extreme poverty. China has also been able to meet other targets, including improving education, increasing [people's] access to clean water, improving the lives of these 470 million. But many development challenges remain for China, including poverty, and other socio-economic and environmental issues.

TY: Of the eight major targets set by world leaders 15 years ago, which ones would you say China has done particularly well in reaching?

ZXM: China's greatest contribution to achieving the MDGs is the poverty reduction. As I mentioned just now, more than 470 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty. This is the single biggest contribution to reducing poverty in human history. According to UNDP, without this success in China, the whole progress in achieving poverty reduction in the world would not have been possible.

TY: Then are there any aspects where China has much room for improvement?

ZXM: Yes, indeed. Despite the rapid economic progress in the past 30 years and more, there are still tens of millions of people living in poverty. This is the goal that we are aiming [at]. Economically, China is going to double its economy by 2020 [since] 2010. The living standards of citizens will also be doubled since 2010. China aims to eliminate poverty by 2020, in about five years' time.

TY: Then what about the aspect of ensuring environmental sustainability? How has China been doing?

ZXM: Environmental protection is the top priority of the Chinese government. China has actually determined to reduce carbon emissions in the future. China is committed to increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to 20% by 2030, and China is also committed to the goal that its peak level of carbon emission will be reached around 2030. So environment protection is a very top priority in China. China has given a lot of resources in this regard.

TY: Well, we all know that China is committed, but how has it been doing in this regard? You know, ensuring environmental sustainability. Has it reached the millennium development goal in this respect?

ZXM: Many goals have basically been met. On the whole, [they have] been met. They are going to have new targets, called SDGs, that will start to be implemented next year. From 2016, China aims to reduce pollution and increase its investment in green energy. Investment in renewable energy last year in China accounted for about one-third of the world's total. China is the biggest investor in this field in the world – bigger than the US, bigger than Europe, and bigger than other regions in the world. That has been a very impressive [progression] in China, you know.

TY: OK, The MDGs are goals set for the whole world to accomplish. As the largest emerging economy, what role do you think China has played in helping the rest of the world, especially other developing countries, to reach the goals?

ZXM: First of all, Chinese economic growth has been an engine for the world economy, particularly since 2008. China accounts for about forty percent of the world's economic growth since 2008. This year, despite a slowdown of its economy, China is still the biggest contributor to the world economic growth. In the next five years, China is expected to expand economically by around seven percent, which means China will contribute between one fourth to one third of the world economic growth. China still remains the engine of growth for the world economy. That, actually, it is the greatest contribution China will make to the attainment of the MDGs.

Secondly, China has supported other developing countries within the framework of South-South cooperation. China has provided aid to more than 120 countries. Additionally, China has also [helped] other countries in other fields, like…transport technology, market access. For example, the least developed countries can export their products free of tariff and China has also [provided] training, help developing countries to develop its capacity. In the last two years, China has been taking initiative in various other important areas. For example, China championed the set-up of AIIB, and we expand these addition to the existing international financial institutions. I mean they are coming into being, we actually help expand those forces, for development projects in developing countries, particularly in Asian nations, in infrastructure development.

TY: But some people argue that those institutions, like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, that China initiated to establish, are some kind of threat or at least some challenge to the existing institutions set up within the framework of the United Nations, such as the World Bank. What's your response to that?

ZXM: If you are impartial, I don't think you would say that. Actually AIIB currently has fifty-seven founding members, and many of these members are from developed nations. I think AIIB, we help find development projects in developing countries. We also actually create business opportunities, not just for Asian nations, for countries, and companies in other countries as well. It's a complement, a supplement to the existing international financial institutions. But, let me put it this way, I must say the coming into being would have a catfish effect. It's hoping that the operation of AIIB and BRICS bank will help prove the efficiency of development project.

TY: Well, another major issue to be touched upon at the gathering I think is the 70th anniversary of the United Nations, which has been facing calls for reform since the late 1990s. So how do you think China can contribute to this process, towards a more equitable international economic and financial order?

ZXM: I think China is committed to improving the environment for development. China will work to improve the governance of the global economic sector and also work to reform the international financial system, including implementing the 2010 consensus to increase the representation and share of developing countries. And China will also work to improve global investment rules. Secondly, I think China would continue to nurture the new international financial institutions, such as AIIB and the BRICS bank. And, these institutions reinforce the current international financial systems. China will also implement the new Silk Road initiative. The initiative is a potential of becoming a driver of the world economy.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/593854160755298/?type=3,2015-09-25 03:15:15,4566,3,3,4566,0,0,0,0,0

1.China is Boeing's largest commercial airplane customer. In turn, Boeing equity investment in China's aviation industry is considerable, with Boeing being the leading commercial purchaser. 

2 The history of cooperation between Boeing and China's aviation industry can be traced back to 1916. The first engineer that Bill Boeing hired was China-born Wong Tsu, who helped design the company's first commercial success — the Model C bi-wing airplane. Mr. Wong later returned to China, playing an important role in early Chinese aviation.

3.China plays a role in every one of Boeing's commercial airplane models — 737, 747, 767, 777, and the newest and most innovative airplane, the 787 Dreamliner. Parts are built in China. Today, more than 8,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with parts built by China.

4.Most of the Boeing factories are located in Seattle and the surrounding areas. Now the company is reaching out to the world.

Here is what some Chinese have to say:
""Hollywood, because I love movies.""
""Obama, because his name always appears in the news headlines.""
""Education in America is the best in the world.""
""NBA. I like basketball and Jordan.""

""The sheer size of China and how many people are there.""
""Fascinating history, great people.""
""I got nothing. I'm sorry. I don't know anything about China.""

223495844457800_592728587534522,"Among the questions raised about President Xi Jinping's visit to the United States, the most puzzling could be related to his first stop, Seattle.

Many people have asked ""why Seattle?""

Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the US, said many places in the country wanted to host Xi and his delegation.

This was especially so with the attention-grabbing first stop, making his job as ambassador much harder since the president's schedule is very tight, and there is no way to include every city he is invited to. Cui's job was to make a recommendation.

Seattle makes sense because it is on the west coast of the US and provides a good balance with the visit to Washington DC on the east coast, according to Chinese experts on relations between the two countries. It is also closer to China than the east coast.

Chen Fengying, an expert on the world economy at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said: ""The US west coast, including Seattle, has many cities known for technology and innovation. Seattle is home to Microsoft, Boeing and other large corporations."" These world-famous companies have long and strong ties to China.

Tao Wenzhao, a researcher of US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Seattle plays an important role in economic and trade relations with China. It was the last stop on then-vice-premier Deng Xiaoping's visit to the US in 1979.   #XiUSAVisit #XiJinping",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/592728587534522/?type=3,2015-09-22 00:38:23,3357,4,22,3357,0,0,0,0,0

""We reject reductive reasoning and lazy rhetoric that says conflict between the U.S. and China is inevitable, even as we've been tough with China where we disagree,"" U.S. President Barack Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice said in a speech on the U.S.-China ties at the George Washington University.

Rice noted that, under the Obama administration, the U.S. has ""deepened our engagement with China at every level -- maximizing our cooperation on areas of mutual interest while confronting and managing our disagreements.""

President Xi will start his first state visit to the U.S. Tuesday in Seattle, Washington state, before traveling to Washington D.C., the U.S. national capital, for a summit meeting with President Obama Friday.

Rice reiterated that pursuing ""a productive relationship with China"" is a critical element of the larger strategy of the U.S. for the Asia Pacific as it is implementing the so-called Rebalance to Asia strategy to expand its engagement in this dynamic region.

The U.S. ""welcomes a rising China that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and a responsible player in global affairs,"" Rice said.

Rice also acknowledged that it is natural that China takes on greater leadership to match its economic development and growing capabilities. 

Meanwhile, Rice highlighted some of the major differences between the two countries on issues such as China's economic policies, cyber security, maritime disputes in East and South China Seas, and human rights.

Firstly, China and the US have a common view on international orders, which is the solid base of mutual trust. Both countries need a stable and peaceful international environment for further strategic cooperation.

An open letter to President Obama and President Xi was issued by the US-China Business Council (USCBC) and the Paulson Foundation after the formal release of the schedule of President Xi's state visit.
The letter was jointly signed by 94 CEOs from US enterprises in hope that the Sino-US Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) would be prioritized during Xi's Visit.
The letter also pointed out that the mutual beneficial trade and investment will provide clear and impartial rules as well as a shorter negative list, facilitating the injection of momentum in Sino-US trade and economic ties.
Both John Frisbie, chairman of USCBC, and Henry Paulson, former US Treasury Secretary stressed on the importance of BIT. Paulson believed it will further open up China to US, creating business and job opportunities for local people.
As Seattle was set as the first stop of Xi's visit, people from all circles are busy preparing for a gracious welcome. Xi will also attend the roundtable session, hosted by Paulson Institute as a part of his meeting with US business elites, where he will speak on market access and China's economic reform.

In China it's not unusual for college students to study hard in their spare time, while in the US, they have a reputation for partying and having fun. 

So what do Chinese students think about college life in the US? 

""When I was studying in the US the American students spend weekends going to clubs and partying. ""
""My American friends had a lot more fun than my Chinese friends and I did, usually we stayed at home studying all the time.""

And what are American students' ideas of college life in China? 

""The Chinese students were doing a lot of studying and going to the library. I think for the average Chinese student studying seems to dominate most of their time.""

""I found that the school here that I've experienced has been not as much fun as much as my school at home.""

So, it seems that while students in China might be studying too hard, those in the US might be having a little too much fun!

The 20 satellites, including nine amateur radio satellites, were developed by a number of universities and space research institutes across China. 

The satellites separated from the rocket 15 minutes after blasting off from Taiyuan.

Developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, the liquid-fuelled carrier rocket measures 29.3 meters in length and has a takeoff weight of 103 tons. 

The light-lift rocket has only a modest lift capability of some 1080 kg. 

However, the launch is crucial to China's new heavy-lift Long March-5 carrier rocket, an equivalent to the US-made Delta-IV Heavy.

Chinese people are the world's biggest tea drinkers, right? Maybe not!

Chinese emperor Shennong is said to have discovered tea over 55 hundred years ago when a leaf fell off a tea bush into boiling water. Chinese tea can be classified as green, yellow, red, black, white and oolong.

In 2012 a pound of west lake Longjing tea sold for more than 25,000 dollars – that's more expensive than gold! But on a list of tea drinking nations, China doesn't even figure in the top 30.

We all know that fortune cookies are Chinese, right? Maybe not! 
Some say they were invented in San Francisco by Makoto Hagiwara in the 1890s or early 1900s.  David Jung from LA also claimed to have invented them in 1918.

In 1983, San Francisco's mock court of historical review attempted to settle the dispute. A fortune cookie was produced in evidence, containing the message, in the end the court ruled in favor of San Francisco.

In fact, fortune cookies were probably invented in Kyoto, Japan in the 19th century. 

One thing's for sure – you'll find fortune cookie's in America and also in Japan. But in China finding one's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

So, across the country, an increasing number are learning to speak mandarin Chinese. And because language is a bridge between cultures, 300 million are also learning English and making new friends around the world.

Back in the day in China leisure time meant flying kites, playing Majong, and kicking a 'Jianzi', a Chinese hacky-sack. But today, the Chinese are discovering things Americans like doing too – like camping, skiing, RV rental, and golf.

China's so big, there's plenty of room to pitch your tent, go paintballing, snowboarding and white water rafting. On the weekend, young Chinese people love to catch a movie and drink a latte or cappuccino in a chain of coffee shops called Xing Ba Ke... but, one leisure activity is very different in China… karaoke - it's everywhere you go.  

People of all ages sing in high end purpose-built karaoke studios with five-star furnishings and first class food.

The Concept of Luck

Have you noticed how people tell you they're not superstitious as they check their daily horoscope? Or how the last seats to be sold on a flight are in row 13?

Well, it's not just Americans who are superstitious. In some buildings in china, there's no 4th, 14th or 24th floor because in mandarin Chinese 'four' sounds like the word for death. In Hong Kong elevator buttons can go as high as 25 in a 21 story building. That's after skipping 13 and all the 'fours'. Here are some other Chinese superstitions…

When an American was visiting Beijing he wanted a SIM card for his phone and chose the cheapest one from a list. But in China, a cheap SIM card means a cellphone number full of unlucky 'fours'. Phone numbers containing the lucky numbers 8, 6 and 9 are more expensive.

The Chinese SIM card didn't fit his U.S. phone, but when he took it back to the shop he was told the real cause of the problem was choosing a cellphone number that included the number four!",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/587339031406811/?type=3,2015-09-08 20:01:36,1958,8,3,1958,0,0,0,0,0

Top Chinese political advisor Yu Zhengsheng on Tuesday called for managing religious affairs according to law and maintaining sound orders of Tibetan Buddhism.

In a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Yu, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, stressed upholding law-based governance in Tibet.

""Religious Affairs should be managed according to law; problems should be addressed through legal thinking and judicial means; and the good order in the worship of Tibetan Buddhism should be maintained,"" Yu said.

He continued by saying that the campaign against separatism and the crackdown on separatist and sabotage activities must also be carried out in line with laws.

Yu arrived in Lhasa, capital of Tibet Autonomous Region, on Sunday, leading a central government delegation to attend festivities marking the 50th anniversary of the region's founding.

Earlier on Monday, top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng said in Tibet that the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government will adhere to policies that ensure the freedom of religious belief. 

Yu made the remarks during a visit to Jokhang Temple, a key Tibetan Buddhism monastery located in the heart of Lhasa, where he is heading a central government delegation to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Tibet Autonomous Region.

""In the past half-century, people from the religious circle of Tibet, taking eminent monks of all generations as examples, have upheld CPC leadership and the socialist system and made significant contributions to national and ethnic unity, religious and social harmony,"" said Yu,.

Some 100 monks at Jokhang Temple welcomed Yu and the delegation in two lines at the gate, blaring horns and burning incense to receive the guests.

Yu brought to the 1,341-year-old Jokhang Temple a banner inscribed by Chinese President Xi Jinping ""enhancing ethnic solidarity, building a beautiful Tibet,"" and a colorful vase standing for peace. He also gave alms to the monks.

President Xi and the central authorities have been caring about the circle of Tibetan Buddhism, according to Yu. In June, Xi met with the 11th Panchen Lama Bainqen Erdini Qoigyijabu; last month, central authorities convened a key meeting on Tibet, outlining plans for the region's sustainable development and long-term stability.

Religious personnel bear great responsibilities, Yu said. He also asked them to reinforce management over temples and implement religious policies to achieve stability and harmony.

Tibetan Buddhism is the dominant religion in the plateau region, where 92 percent of about 3.2 million inhabitants are Tibetans.

A government white paper released on Sunday said China has fully respected freedom of religious belief, and gave equal attention and protection to all religions and sects, adding that there are 1,787 sites for different religious activities in Tibet, and more than 46,000 resident monks and nuns.

The central government has spent more than 1.4 billion yuan (about 220 mln U.S. dollars) on restoring Tibetan cultural relics and refurbishing key monasteries, it said.

Basketball is enjoyed by millions of Americans and millions of Chinese people too. So, how does the sport bring the two countries together?

The Chinese Basketball Association is the top men's professional league in China, and there's a women's association too.

The team names usually have three parts – city, sponsor, and nickname… usually an animal. Sometimes they change them. Shandong switched from ""flaming bulls"" to ""lions"".

In 1995 Chinese basketball got a boost when the home and away system was introduced, allowing the transfer of players and managers into and out of China. This allowed Chinese players to join the NBA – including Yao Ming, Tianju He, and Zhelin Wang.

American NBAers also play in China, including Randolph Morris of the Beijing Ducks and Hamed Haddadi of the Sichuan Blue Whales.

So, when it comes to international friendship through sports, it's a slam dunk for basketball!

A total of 520 people have been hospitalized, including 66 critically injured, according to the rescue headquarters.

The Tianjin fire brigade said it has sent 1,000 firefighters and 143 fire engines to the warehouse, which contained dangerous goods. The volatility of the goods has made the fire unpredictable and dangerous to approach.

Firefighters told Xinhua that the road leading to the blaze remains blocked, and they have only been able to spray dry powder and foam from a distance. Armed police are also standing by at the site.

A firefighter told Xinhua that a dozen fire engines have driven into the site, and more firemen will enter to put out the flames and make way for search and rescue efforts.

Xinhua reporters saw at least 200 armed police officers around the warehouse.

Lu Yun, head of Teda Hospital, which admitted about 150 injured people, told Xinhua that most of the injuries were from broken glass or stones. Some of the injuries are serious.

On May 28, 2015, Ambassador Cui Tiankai had an interview with Mr. Adam Horvath, World Editor of The Wall Street Journal.

The following is an edited transcript of the interview:

The Wall Street Journal: Ambassador, thanks for being here. As we speak, this week rhetoric has kind of been heating up between the U.S. and China over a development in the South China Sea-what most countries call the Spratly Islands and China calls the Nansha Islands, and both what China has been doing there and the U.S. response to it. Can you tell me where you think this kind of battle of words is going, over what is the right thing for each country to be doing in that region?

Ambassador Cui Tiankai: Well, first of all, it's really nice to be here and talk to you. Maybe we should start by setting a few facts straight. First, what China is doing is only on the islands and reefs that fall within our sovereignty and our control. We are not trying to take back the islands and reefs occupied by others, although we believe such occupation is illegal. Number two, what we are building there is mainly for civilian purposes. Of course, we have facilities for defense purposes-but the main components are for civilian services. The services will be rendered to the ships not only of China, but also other countries-services like shelter, search-and-rescue, meteorological observation, marine environment protection, fishery production and so on and so forth. Number three: It was very surprising to us that the United States has overreacted to the situation and is escalating the situation. The U.S. is sending military reconnaissance planes to the region and with reporters on board-which is clearly an attempt to provoke and escalate the situation. And the U.S.A. is also making a lot of statements-making false accusations against China and taking sides in the territorial disputes in the region. That would really make the situation in the region less stable. So we are worried about such overreaction from the United States.

WSJ: As the U.S. explains it, they're responding to some moves by China that the U.S. views as provocative and other neighbors in the region view as provocative. One is to claim airspace over a territory that is more than just the reefs themselves. And another is concern about-you mentioned defense facilities-militarization of that area, which is strategically important lying between China and several of its neighbors. Can you understand the idea of provocation that other countries are seeing on China's part?

Cui: I think that the fact is that we are more concerned than anybody else about the safety and freedom of navigation in the region, because China is one of the major trading countries in the world. We have such a huge volume of import and export going through South China Sea. So, stability is very much of our interest, and I believe it will serve the interests of everybody else-unless someone has a different agenda. If somebody really wants to see escalation of the tension in the region, that could be made as excuses for advancing their military deployment, for setting up Cold War-type alliances there, and setting up new missile defense systems. If that is the real intention of somebody, then everything else will fall into place-it's easier to see the logic. Otherwise, I don't see the logic why they're making such statements.

WSJ: Well, I've seen this language about the idea of a hidden agenda before from officials from the China foreign ministry talking about-seem to be talking about-the U.S. Does China really feel that the U.S. is trying to use an excuse here to ramp up its military engagement in this region?

Cui: I think, as I said earlier, stability in the region will certainly serve the interests of everyone: China, United States, the regional countries. But what the U.S. is doing has given rise to a lot of questions in China: Why are they overreacting? Why are they reacting like this? Why are they sending more and more military ships, airplanes, for reconnaissance activities so close to China? What is the real intention? Is there any attempt to replay the Cold War in Asia?

WSJ: Does China feel encircled by recent U.S. moves with its allies? There are a few things I know you can point to-there's enhanced defense cooperation with Japan and with Philippines, and with Australia as well. But again, in all of those, the countries involved see themselves as responding to China's ramping up of its projection of strength, its plans for military building of aircraft carriers and claiming more ownership of the seas and airspace in the area.

Cui: Actually, we are not worried of our relations with our neighbors. I think our relations with our neighbors are developing quite well. For instance, our relations with the Asian countries, on the whole, are quite good. And you see recent developing relations with India-even with Japan. So China stands for relationships of friendship and cooperation with our neighbors.…But what concerns us is not that we might be encircled, or contained-I don't think anybody in the world has the capability to contain or encircle China. What worries us is that such action would have implications on the regional and global stability. If we let this Cold War mentality continue to play out, then there might be a replay of the Cold War in Asia. There might be confronting military blocs-kind of Cold War military blocs confronting each other in Asia. Will that serve the interest of anybody: China, the United States, Asians? I don't think so, because if regional stability is disrupted, if the good momentum of economic growth is weakened, if the good prospect of regional economic cooperation is diminished-everybody will be hurt. Those are the consequences. I don't know if people in Washington, D.C. have ever given serious thought to such consequences.

WSJ: It's true what you say about other agreements with your neighbors and good relations in other ways-and in a way, I think that's sometimes what is so confusing to people watching this set of disputes from afar: Why is this combination of reefs so important-not only to claim, but to build upon and to expand claims on?

Cui: These claims-the disputes over territorial claims-have been there for a long, long time. And I think, if everybody is taking a constructive approach, we will be able to manage them-to control them-so the overall relationship will not be disrupted. This is still China's stance. But it is important that no major power try to intervene.…What is even more important is the intention. What is the intention for doing all of these things, to have such frequent, high-intensity, reconnaissance activities. We are not talking about the Gulf of Mexico; we are not talking about the coast of California-we are not even talking about Hawaii. We are talking about South China Sea, which is so close to China. If you don't have any hostile intention, why are you doing all this?

WSJ: Well, I think you know the answers, because the U.S. has alliances with China's neighbors that also have interests in that region-

Cui: But that would imply these alliances are anti-China in nature, if that is an explanation. If these alliances are committed to common security, to cooperation with all of the regional countries, then they should not have done all of these things. The only explanation is that these alliances would aim at China as a rivalry or even an enemy. That's the most dangerous thing.

WSJ: But this does seem like an example where I see the rhetoric rising from what I think I've seen before, on both sides. Is it anti-China for the U.S. to have defense relationships with Australia, and the Philippines, and so forth?

Cui: Well, I think that's up to the U.S. government to give you a clarification-but I think that it will be most counterproductive and even stupid to have such a policy-such an anti-China policy and try to form military alliances that aim against China.

WSJ: But I'm just saying that they do have alliances-they do have defense cooperation. That's not new, that's been going on for some time. To term that as anti-China sounds to me like you're seeing it as more of a threat than before, or publicly calling it more of a threat than before.

Cui: It is not what we are seeing-I think the question is ""what they are doing?"" You should not do anything that will convince people back in China that you are really directed against us. We only look at the facts.

WSJ: Let me ask you this:Ashton Carter, the U.S. defense secretary, asked for all building by all countries to stop in the islands-to basically take a pause by everybody from this development, because other countries have done [building] as well. Would China be willing to take that pause and stop and have a broader conversation about what's appropriate in the region?

Cui: What about the buildings, the constructions, the facilities that have been built by others for many years? What about them?

WSJ: He's saying stop and have a moratorium for everybody.

Cui: Are they going to pull them down?

WSJ: I guess that would be the next question, right? If you got together to talk about it-that would be one of the next questions.

Cui: The first thing the United States could do in a very constructive way is to stop reconnaissance flights or ships so close to China.

WSJ: If a U.S. aircraft or a Navy vessel goes within 12 nautical miles of one of these reefs, would China consider that reason to fire on the craft?

Cui: Like every other sovereign country in the world, we certainly have the right and capability to defend ourselves.

WSJ: I feel that even asking that question kind of shows the level mutual hostility, or lack of understanding, that's developed around this issue whereas, as you say, around other issues that's not there. I mean, there's plenty of discussion and cooperation on trade and economic issues.

Cui: Yeah, right-you are right. I think we have a much bigger relationship than just these issues. And besides, South China Sea should not be an issue between China and the United States. The United States has no territorial claim in the region. Why should there be an issue between us? And also, as I said earlier: Intention is the most important thing. We'll make our own judgment on what the U.S. is doing and is saying. And we certainly want to have a very positive, cooperative and developing relationship with the United States-not only on trade, on climate change, on disaster prevention-but also on security issues. We are ready for a very positive interaction with the U.S. in the Pacific, in South China Sea. But such approach should be reciprocated and we have always exercised restraint-but restraint should not be one-way traffic.

WSJ: But why would you think the U.S. is seeking to ramp up tensions in that region-what would be the purpose of doing that from the U.S. perspective?

Cui: There is an interpretation of all this, although I'm not convinced yet and I hope that this interpretation will prove to be wrong. But it goes like this: Some people want to see tensions-or even heightened tensions in the region-so that there will be good reason for them to advocate for advancement of military deployment; setting up of new missile defense systems; strengthening the military alliances there and try to make China a landlocked country. So there would be an Asian NATO and the Cold War will replay in the region. There is such a school of thought-although I'm not convinced by it yet.

WSJ: But that's the balance that China has to strike, isn't it? To project the strength that you want and move without being constrained militarily-and yet not rattle your neighbors to the extent where they all band together, ramp up their own approach, and then look provocative to you in return.

Cui: I don't think all our neighbors-

WSJ: Some neighbors.

Cui: Some of them, that's quite true. But you see, China's growing military strength, and maybe presence, is driven not by some grand strategy-but by the growing economic and other needs since China's economy is integrating into the global economy ever closely. And we have such a growing interest in many issues, even in faraway places. So, it's only natural that we should develop capabilities to defend such a legitimate interest. To make sure that our trade with others-our energy resources, imports, and all these economic relations with others-are well-protected. And also, as China develops, there's a growing expectation in the world that China will shoulder a great international responsibility. And we are ready to do that. We are fully aware of this growing need for China to take up more responsibilities internationally. We are ready to do that. I don't think people should see this as kind of a threat. We are responding to the economic needs-we are responding to the growing international expectations. And we are ready to fulfill our international obligations. This will open up a good opportunity for China, the U.S. and others to cooperate with each other-because there are so many global issues. I don't think any country can handle all these issues single-handed. Not China, certainly-but also not the United States. We have to work together on this.

WSJ: Thank you Ambassador for coming and speaking with us.

Cui: Thank you. I'm glad to be here.

223495844457800_535351976605517,"While 6 million Jews were murdered during WWII, tens of thousands of Jews had a relatively peaceful life in China. And the good memories last in their whole lives.

At an office in Tel Aviv, Israel, a group of aged people were chatting heatedly. With their appearances definite foreigners, they spoke Chinese sometimes to each other.

""Who are you? I am Chinese. I forgot a lot of my Chinese language, but the important words I know: I love you.""

The office is the Association of Former Jewish Residents of China, and all the people chatting here used to live in China.

◇War Period
 
Before the 1950s, there used to be tens of thousands of Jews living in China. A small part of them were Jews who fled the Holocaust from Europe, but most of them came to China much earlier.
  
Rasha Kaufman was born in Shanghai in 1933. She says that they were lucky to be in China during the Second World War and she feels deep friendship and gratitude. Her brother-in-law was born in Poland. When he was 10 years old, his parents sent him and his 13-years-old bother to Romania to escape the Holocaust, and he has never seen them again.

""At 10 years old, he was alone in the world with his brother, he was lucky that they put them on a train and they came to Palestine, to Israel, but his memories are terrible. He went back to Poland, and when he came back he was sick. And we came back from China like crazy, like we went to the biggest party. We were lucky, very very lucky, and our memories are beautiful.""
 
Teddy Piastunovich, Chairman of Israel-China Friendship Society, lived in Tianjin during the war. He says life was normal and the Chinese people were very good to Jews.
 
""When there was a war around and there was the Holocaust, there was no Holocaust to Jews in China. This is a miracle for the Jews. The Japanese came to our houses and took away our radios, so we didn't even know about the Holocaust. We knew nothing about what was going on in Europe.""
 
Hana Muller was in Harbin during the wartime. Although life was more difficult, she doesn't remember any real hardship for Jews there.

""There was rationing of food, you couldn't go to the shop and buy everything you wanted. Everybody got allocation, a hundred grams of this, or a hundred grams of that. And in school we had to start learning Japanese. The Japanese were very bad towards Chinese, very bad, that I saw. I was a little girl, but I remember. They were very strict. But towards Jewish there was no problem, I didn't feel any.""
 
In the late 1930s, flocks of European Jews escaping the Holocaust came to China, the only place in the world that opened the door to Jews at that time.

Hana tells the story of one of her classmates' family.

""That was a mixed marriage. The wife was German and the father was Jewish, so they had to be separated. The wife remained in Berlin, and the father with the children came to China. They came to Harbin, and in Harbin they had good life. The father was a doctor. And the girls went to school.""
 
But most Jews fleeing to China stayed in Shanghai. In 1943, under the pressure of Nazi Germany's ""Final Solution"" to systematically exterminate the Jewish population, the Japanese forced all the Jews coming to Shanghai after 1937 to live in a special district in Hongkew, known as ""Shanghai Ghetto"". They could only get out of the ghetto with permissions if they had work outside.
 
Yutta Friedman fled with her parents from Germany to Shanghai in 1938 when she was 5 years old.

""First we lived in the French concession, and then when the Japanese came we had to move to Hongkew, to the ghetto. We had enough food. That was very good. There were Chinese neighbors and Jewish neighbors. They were very good. I liked the life in China very much until we were bombed out. There were bombardments from the Americans, and we were not allowed to go out of Hongkew.""
 
The US air raids on Shanghai began in 1944. The most devastating raid started on July 17, 1945, and was the first attack on Hongkew. The bombings continued daily until the Atomic Bomb was dropped on Japan's Hiroshima.

Abraham Fradkin came to China in 1924 with his family when he was one year old. He used to help send food to the ghetto. He says the lives of Jews in the ghetto were not easy, but they survived, and they had a good relationship with their Chinese neighbors.

""They had small workshops, small factories. A lot of them came with know-how, with knowledge, to have a small factory making either this or this, cafés, hospitals, workshops, tailors, and people who fixed the shoes, everything was normal, like a normal city. Most of the people who lived in the area were Chinese people, so there was friendship. They lived in the same apartments. They were all intertwined, business and everything in the same area.""
 
Samuel Muller, Hana's husband who lived in Tianjin, says they only knew about the Holocaust when the war was over. His uncle and their children were in Poland and they all disappeared.

""It was terrible. In general it was a tragedy. Six million of your people were killed. You lived in peace, never had anything like that. I must say that we were lucky.""

◇Unforgettable Childhood
 
For these Jews who lived in China, their childhoods were full of good memories. Parents used to play mahjong and the children played with locals in the street.

""We used to play crickets. We sit down with the Chinese boys, friends. We used to buy crickets, and they had cricket fights. When they part a little, and you tickle and they used to sing. And we used to play with them all the time. I played marbles. I was very good. Marbles, maqiou (polo), jianzi (shuttlecock), and yoyo, I played very well.""
 
And there was delicious Chinese food.

""I remember my mother used to go to the market. The market was not far away from our house. In the morning we used to eat shaobing guozi (local food) for breakfast. Chinese food was very popular, very good for us.""
 
And the good memories have remained for their whole lives.

""We really had a good childhood. We all love to remember it. We still love the food. I'm already over 80, we still meet with friends here. We keep our connections. It means a lot. It's a very important part of our lives that we cherish, all of us cherish.""

◇Leaving China
 
Since the late 1940s, Jews began to leave China, most went to Israel and some went to other places around the world.
 
As one of the pioneers to Israel from China, Samuel Muller was met by Madam Soong Ching-ling before he left.

""I know her, Mrs. Sun Yat-sen. Before I left China, I met with her. When Israel was founded, she heard we were going back to Israel, so she asked to meet with us. She wished us good luck and happiness.""

But it was hard to part from the beloved Chinese people.
 
Mary Shwartz left China when she was 15 years old. She is sharing her old photos with friends.

""This is my amah, she took care of me, my nurse. This was taken one day before I went away from China. She wanted to keep me in China, she said stay here, I'll take care of you. My amah bought me this dress before I went to Israel, and when I was 20 I still wore this dress. In Israel there was no such dress, Chinese dress.""

◇Keeping Link to China
 
In 1951, Jews from China set up the Association of Former Residents of China.

Yossi Klein is the current Chairman of the association.

""At that time it was quite clear, because people from China tried to continue their lives in Israel, their social life. There was very active social life for Jews in China, they tried to continue, and tried also to help each other. That is still what we are trying to do now.""
 
Since then, the non-profit association has acted as a center for all the Jews from China around the world. Bulletins have been published for over 60 years, and people meet there regularly with friends, cherishing the memories of China. And those who live abroad also come when they visit Israel.
 
""Every week we come and meet on Wednesdays. I live very far away. I come with 4 buses, but I want to meet my friends, so I come.""

""People know when they come to Israel, here they can meet and renew friendship. We are all very happy always to see each other.""
 
While trying to adapt to the new life, the memories of China, as well as the Chinese language, have accompanied them.

Samuel Muller tells his own story.

""My Chinese is not good already. I forgot my Chinese. When I left China I could speak Chinese, I could write, and I could read newspapers. When I came to Israel, I once met with my friend in a soldiers' club. We spoke Chinese between us. I didn't speak good Hebrew at that time. My Chinese was better than my Hebrew. And an officer came, he said what are you speaking, we said Chinese, he said OK, come to intelligence service, then you can speak Chinese between yourself, nobody will understand, you can by radio speak Chinese.""

◇Going Home

Although always longing to revisit China, they couldn't do it for decades.

""We always dreamt that one day we are going to go back and see China. This was our dream, because there was no connection with China, diplomatic.""
 
In 1992, when China and Israel established diplomatic relations, the dream came true.
 

Abraham Fradkin says they were so happy when the Chinese diplomats came to Israel.

""Imagine, I left in 1947, and this was 1992. We had our association together with people who came from China and live in Israel. For us it's a common thing the love of China, and to feel that we want to be in China, but we couldn't get to China. All of a sudden, in 1992, the delegation came here, the ambassador, they didn't know anybody. They hug us. We hug them. We showed them the country and we held parties for them. It was beautiful.""

And he was among the first Jews who revisited China.

""The delegation met us from Chinese Friendship Association in Beijing, some of us were crying. It wasn't easy. It's part of our life. Of course I'm excited, after all, so many years.""
 
Samuel Muller also went to China in 1992. After over 40 years, he saw again the house where he used to live in Tianjin.

""When I came first time to Tianjin, the driver went on a taxi, I said you took the wrong way. He said, how do you know. I said, I know, I lived here. The house was still there at that time. It's always emotional to go back where you were born. For 15 years I lived in that house. It's the house you grew up in, so it's about your life.""

Since then, he has been doing business with China, until today.

Ralphael Gazal now lives in New York. He was born in Shanghai in 1932 and can still speak some Shanghai dialect.

""I remember everything since I was a kid. Anywhere you want me to show you I'll take you around. I lived in a lane on Seymour Road, lane 640, house No. 23, and my telephone number there was 37731.""
 
But he never went back to Shanghai since he left in 1949.

""I would love to go and see what it is like and tour back again, but it's heart-breaking, because everybody you missed is not there. I even remember the tree I used to sit down as a kid and play harmonica in school.""

On his passport, the place of birth is written 'China'.

""An American passport says born in China. Every time I come back, go home, in the port they look at me, say you are from china? How can it be? You don't look like Chinese. I was born there, I said. Just like anywhere else, you were born there, that's the country you adopt.""

◇I love China
 
At the houses of these Jews, there are always things from China. Abraham Fradkin has invested a lot of money to buy Chinese antiques, and his apartment is like a museum.
 
""We always feel that we are part of China. We had a good time in China. We love China. We got used to China. It was like our home. China was our home. That's why when you come to people who lived in China in the old days, you'll always find something from China. Why? Because these things are dear to him. It's important for him to have contact with these things.""
 
As years pass by, all these Jews from China are getting older and older. Yossi Klein says now only a few Israelis know that there used to be Jews living in China

""In school they are asking especially in Israel because there are so many people coming from so many different places, they ask where is your mother from, where is your father from, and when my children were telling from China, they were laughing. They thought they were joking.""
 
But some of the offspring of these Jews are still continuing the relationship with China.
 
Ave Podolsky left Harbin in 1961. His son Alex was born half a year before they came to Israel.

""My son said, I want to see where I was born, so I took him to Harbin. I showed him the hospital where he was born. He is the last Jewish child born in Harbin. He's very proud of being born in China. He knows his root is in China.""
 
Mary Shwartz's grandson Tal Ziv is now studying Chinese at Hebrew University and plans to go to China next year.

""I'm very happy about it. It makes me feel good that I give something from what I have in my heart, my love of China. And I really believe that China is the future of the world.""
 
The Association of Former Jewish Residents of China gives scholarships to offspring of Jews who used to live in China, as well as Chinese students studying in Israel, to continue with the love and friendship. To these Jews, the experience in China makes them unique, and China is still their home.
 
""We are different from Israelis. We are more polite, because the Chinese are polite.""

""Every time I go to China, I feel like at home, it's not like you go to some strange country, it's home. Going home, comfortable. We didn't have a Chinese education. We had foreign education, and we spoke at home foreign languages, not Chinese language. Nonetheless, Chinese food, Chinese culture, Chinese habits, became part of us.""
 
And the love of China is with them, despite time.

""I love the Chinese language. I love Chinese food. I love Chinese girls. I love China. You see I still remember Chinese. I spoke like a Chinese man. When somebody ask me, are you Chinese or are you a foreigner, I say I'm Chinese, I'm not a foreigner. China is a beautiful country. We love China.""",Former Jewish Residents' Love of China,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.535351896605525.1073741888.223495844457800/535351976605517/?type=3,2015-05-15 01:48:19,2,0,35,2,0,0,0,0,0
223495844457800_535151593292222,"Chinese President Xi Jinping met with visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Xi'an, capital city of Shaanxi Province and Xi's hometown, on Thursday afternoon.

""This is the first time I have treated a foreign leader in my hometown and I hope you have a happy stay,"" Xi said when the meeting started.

Xi welcomed Modi and thanked him for the warm reception he received in his India visit in last September, during which Modi accompanied him to visit his home state of Gujarat.

""That left me with deep and good impression,"" Xi said.

Xi said during his September visit they reached an important consensus on promoting the bilateral strategic partnership of cooperation and forging a closer partnership of development.

Both sides maintained frequent high-level contact and engagement, promoted cooperation in priority areas including construction of railway and industrial park, strengthened exchanges, controlled the bordering areas and kept good communication on international and regional affairs, Xi said.

China-India relations are experiencing stable development and facing broad prospects, the president added.

He said he believed Modi's visit will push forward the bilateral strategic partnership to achieve new progress, which has potential for greater development.

Modi said he was glad to visit China. He cited his trip in some historical places of interest in Xi'an and spoke highly of the cultural exchanges between the two ancient civilizations.

This is the first China visit for Modi as the Indian leader, who made a vow to visit during his first year as prime minister. 

The first stop of his current China trip is in the ancient city of Xian instead of Beijing. This departure from protocol with a rare personal touch is being seen by Western media as a sign of the importance China is attaching to this visit and also a reciprocal gesture after President Xi was first hosted by Prime Minister Modi in Gujarat last year, highlighting warming ties between the Asian giants despite their continued rivalry and contrasting political systems.

A waist-drum dance show was staged at the airport, which is a traditional way to welcome a guest in Shaanxi.

Following his arrival, Modi paid a visit to the local museum displaying ancient terracotta warriors and horses of the Qin Dynasty and the famous Wild Goose Pagoda, the spiritual structure built to highlight famous Chinese Buddhist monk Xuan Zang's journey to India in 645 AD through the ancient Silk Road.

On Friday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and top legislator Zhang Dejiang will also meet Modi in Beijing. Invited by Li, Modi's tour will last three days. 
 
Media reports say that trade imbalance will figure high on the agenda. The trade deficit between India and China increased about 34 percent to $48.43 billion in 2014-15 from $36.21 billion in the previous fiscal year. India's concern on the rising deficit has been discussed with China earlier as well. India also has concerns about China's ambitious Maritime Silk Roads project, though Beijing is keen to have India on board. No substantive developments are expected on the border issue; India is likely to announce e-visas for Chinese nationals after the Prime Minister's Office overruled concerns of the intelligence agencies. 20 business agreements are likely to be signed during the visit.

A report by the Associated Press (AP) describes Xi Xinping and Narendra Modi as the strongest leaders to emerge in years from the world's two most populous nations, who appear to be trying to forge a strong working relationship. The two men will aim to move beyond the symbolism and take substantial steps to seal a new spirit of cooperation.

China is looking to India as a market for its increasingly high-tech goods, from high-speed trains to nuclear power plants, while India is keen to attract Chinese investment in manufacturing and infrastructure. With a slowing economy, excess production capacity and nearly $4 trillion in foreign currency reserves, China is ready to satisfy India's estimated $1 trillion in demand for infrastructure projects such as airports, roads, ports and railways.

""India is looking for investments, and China has the money. It could be a win-win for both countries,"" Srikanth Kondapalli, Chinese studies professor at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University is quoted as saying.

The AP report says Both Xi and Modi have considerable personal authority to drive the relationship. Since taking the helm of the ruling Communist Party in 2012, Xi has consolidated control over the military, economy and foreign policy to an extent unseen in two decades. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party swept national elections a year ago, largely based on his personal charisma. Experts believe that a close, personal relationship with Xi and other Chinese leaders, could help Modi further his domestic agenda of strengthening the Indian economy through trade ties and Chinese investment, with the informal setting in Xi'an providing the conditions under which greater understanding between the leaders can take place.

CRI and Russian Newspaper Sign Cooperation Agreements in Moscow 

China Radio International (CRI) and the Russian Rossiyskaya Gazeta signed cooperation agreements, with the presence of Chinese president Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday.

Wang Gengnian, director-general of CRI and his counterpart Pavel Negoitsa, president of Russian official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta signed the agreements at the Kremlinin.

The agreements aim to deepen media cooperation and foster long-term mutual benefits between the two countries.

CRI and the Rossiyskaya Gazeta will conduct cooperation on staff training and exchanges and the sharing of program materials.

The two sides also agreed to strengthen mutual cooperation in the coverage of the '70th anniversary of victory over fascism' and 'Silk Road economic belt' construction.

According to the documents, the two agencies will further work on China Wind, a bimonthly magazine featuring China in the Russian language jointly issued by the two state media organizations. The magazine currently covers Moscow, St.Petersburg, Ekaterinburg, Irkutsk, Blagoveshchensk, and Vladivostok. Its annual circulation has reached around 360, 000 copies.

PetroChina, China's largest oil producer, has reported a sharper-than-expected downturn in its first-quarter profits due to lower international crude prices and inventory writedowns at its refining division.

The company pulled in just under 1-billion US dollars during the first 3-months of the year. This is down some 82 percent compared to the same period last year.

PetroChina is attributing this to the sharp decline in global oil prices, on top of weak domestic demand, which also led to a huge loss in refining operations.

In putting out its quarterly results, PetroChina also says it's been able to slash its operating costs by just under 4 percent through the first quarter.

The refining and chemicals segment incurred a loss from operations of 5.07 billion yuan, more than double the loss of operations compared with the same period last year.

Operating profit in the exploration and production sector also plunged 67.2 percent to 17.30 billion yuan.

In the sales segment, the firm incurred an operating loss of 2.59 billion yuan, compared with the operating profits of 3.32 billion yuan last year.

The state-owned oil and gas producing giant vowed to further slash spending and divest more assets this year.

Many analysts believe that although PetroChina is the most profitable company in Asia, this success may largely be attributed to the near duopoly on the wholesale and retail business of oil products it shares with Sinopec in China. So there is great potential for improving its corporate management.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/529988230475225/?type=3,2015-04-27 22:19:00,3,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0
223495844457800_529541027186612,"China and Britain established formal diplomatic relations in 1972 but the affinity between the two nations can be traced back several centuries. China, due to its vast landscapes, ethnically diverse population and venerable culture, has enraptured countless foreigners. In the eyes of American photojournalist Tom Carter, living in this eastern land is ""an endless scroll of experiences"". Yet for British novelist, speaker and businessman Adam Williams, China has a more profound connotation. Williams' family has lived and worked in China from the late Nineteenth Century and a great part of his family history has already intertwined with the evolution of modern China.

As Williams explains, ""I come from a family which has lived in China since the 1890s. Two sets of great grandfathers came out about the same time. One was a medical missionary, the other one was a railway engineer. I was born in Hong Kong, my mother was born in Qinhuangdao, her mother was born in Changchun and my great grandfather was born in Beijing! So we have a long China pedigree.""

From the Boxer Rebellion and the warlord era to the birth of the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese invasion, this expatriate family lived through China's key incidents and their experiences mirrored the crucible of the country's recent history. Talking more about his ancestors, Williams notes, ""They were coming to China to provide very similar things to what people like me would come to China to provide in the 1980s. I mean they were bringing electricity, railways, new ideas and all sorts of westernization. This caused great friction in many ways, whether it was manifested in the rejection of it, or the adoption of it.""

Although the family left China during the Second World War and later settled in the colonized Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland was always a strong presence throughout Williams' childhood. As elders told stories of Chinese warlords, such as Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin, romantic imagery plus a slice of mystery constituted the impression of China for a young Adam Williams. ""When I was naughty as a little boy, my mother would tell me, 'You be good, or Zhang Zuolin will come to get you.' I didn't know who Zhang Zuolin was; I thought he was a monster with big teeth. But I could tell you that I have been scared of Zhang Zuolin all my life. ""

Growing up with a deep understanding about Chinese history and with encouragement from his father, Adam Williams inevitably followed in his predecessors' footsteps. In 1980, Williams joined the Sino-British Trade Council, an organization that promotes bilateral trade and investment. Five years later, he ended up living in Beijing and has been actively engaged with China-related business practices ever since. ""Sino-British trade now is better than it has ever been,"" Williams explained to CRI. ""The amount of bilateral trade, the amount of investment both ways is innumerous. I think there is occasionally political squabble, but it is like the storm on the surface of the lake; underneath there's actually a very strong bond. I think there is great mutual respect and friendship.""

In 1999, as chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, Williams received an Order of the British Empire from the Queen due to his contribution towards the bilateral trade between the UK and China. But his real passion doesn't lie with commerce. From 1997 onwards, making full use of his spare time, this successful businessman started to put pen to paper. Inspired by his family heritage in China, his literary debut ""The Palace of Heavenly Pleasure,"" set in northern China in the late Nineteenth Century, went on to become an international bestseller. William's second installment in his China trilogy, ""The Emperor's Bones"" extensively examines the turmoil of the country in the 1920s and has sparked heated discussion among critics and readers, since few Chinese writers have ever examined this period of history so extensively. 

Despite receiving overwhelming praise, this internationally acclaimed novelist remains indifferent to the opinions of others who challenge his attempt to write about Chinese history. ""People ask me about how could you write China as a foreigner and I think, am I a foreigner? I have been here for four generations. You know, this is my world."" Now, living happily with his wife and famous writer Hong Ying, and their daughter in Beijing, the 62-year-old Williams still acts as a consultant to help many British enterprises enter the Chinese market. 

After thirty years of working in China, Williams says he is still amazed by the fast growth of the reawakened nation and feels lucky to live in such a dynamic country. ""The privilege of being in China for the last thirty years is extraordinary. China has compressed what took Europe two hundred years to develop into thirty years; whether culturally, whether socially, whether agriculturally, whether industrially. ""

As something of a China expert, Williams also adds that for many British people, China remains an exotic place. At the same time, there are still plenty of myths about Britain among Chinese people. In terms of promoting mutual communication, the road seems long, but with the help of cultural ambassadors like Adam Williams alongside high-level events such as the UK-China Year of Cultural Exchange, people from both nations can come together and enhance their understanding.

With hordes of corrupt government officials and company executives netted, China's massive anti-corruption drive has continued to widen, and now reached the other side of the globe.

Chinese law enforcement is launching a new campaign to try to capture corrupt officials who have fled abroad by seeking help from the United States. 

The country's anti-graft authority says the so-called ""Skynet"" campaign is a follow-up to last year's ""Fox Hunt"" campaign that has targeted rich Chinese suspected of economic crimes who have fled abroad. China is trying to recover their illicit assets.

The new campaign, which begins next month, is designed to try to block the ""last route of retreat"" for corrupt officials. 

Its focus will be on capturing corrupt officials, cleaning up illegal certifications, unraveling illegal underground banks, recovering assets involved in criminal cases and tracking down fugitive suspects abroad, or trying to convince them to return to China.

In particular, the Chinese government believes at least 150 corrupt Chinese officials have fled to the United States, according to state media, and has sent U.S. authorities a list of the ""priority cases"" it is targeting.

The U.S. State Department confirmed Wednesday that China has sent lists of suspects to the U.S. China has also agreed to hand over more evidence on priority cases to help U.S. officials track them down, then prosecute or deport them.

Neither Beijing nor Washington has given details about the list of targets, though at least one Chinese citizen has already been arrested in the U.S. with China's help, according to the US Department of Justice (DOJ). 

Last week, Shilan Zhao, the ex-wife of a former Chinese official, was arrested in Washington state, on charges of immigration fraud and money laundering, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.

Zhao and her ex-husband, Jianjun Qiao, were charged with fraudulently obtaining visas through a popular immigrant investor program known as EB-5.

The Department of Justice also claims that the couple bought property in the U.S. with money laundered through a massive grain storage facility in China, where Qiao served as director for 13 years. Qiao remains at large, and is still being sought by U.S. authorities, according to the DOJ. 

A U.S. prosecutor said last week the United States may deport Shilan Zhao to China.

However, there is no U.S.-China extradition treaty and Western governments have long been reluctant to hand over suspects given concerns about a lack of transparency and due process in China's judicial system.

But Liu Dong, head of the Ministry of Public Security's economic crimes division, told the English-language newspaper China Daily that U.S. authorities were prejudiced against China's legal system and ""mistakenly believe we would undertake unfair prosecution of suspects"".
  
While the U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with China, the State Department said it can still return fugitives to China.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki has said whether or not any fugitive was returned to another country depended on whether the United States was satisfied the person would receive a fair trial and not be subject to torture or other forms of mistreatment.
 
Since last October, the Chinese government has brought back 49 individuals suspected of economic crimes from 17 countries.

A total of 680 fugitives were repatriated during the ""Fox Hunt"" campaign from July to the end of last year.

They stressed optimal land development, more recycling, technological innovation and adjustment to the economic structure. The importance of a system to advance conservation culture was also discussed, with a concrete plan promised ""as soon as possible.""

223495844457800_510144665792915,"Deflationary pressures ease as China's inflation picks up in February 
 
It's good news that China's consumer inflation rebounded in February from a more-than-five-year low. 

For the current state of the Chinese economy, moderate inflation can be a boon to consumption as it encourages consumers to buy before prices go up, while falling prices encourage shoppers to delay purchases and companies to put off investment, both of which can hurt growth. 

Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate a 1.4 percent increase in the consumer price index (CPI) in February as compared with a gain of 0.8 percent in January. 

The result has exceeded the median forecast for a 1.0 percent gain in a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News and beaten expectations of a 0.9 percent rise predicted in a Reuters poll, but it came largely due to higher prices for food and services surrounding China's annual lunar new year holiday, which economists largely saw as a one-off and unlikely to be sustained. Senior NBS analyst Yu Qiumei said in a statement regarding the February CPI data that fresh food demand rose during the holiday, ""leading prices to rise by large margins"". Food prices, which account for nearly one-third of China's CPI weighting, increased 2.4 percent year on year in February. Yu added that transport and tourism prices also increased, while labor shortages prompted by migrant workers returning home also pushed up costs for services such as nannies and housekeepers, which rose 6.3 percent from the previous month.   

In contrast, the producer price index (PPI) -- a measure of costs for goods at the factory gate and inflation at the wholesale level -- declined for the 36th straight month in February.

The PPI fell 4.8 percent year-on-year, the NBS said, which was more than the 4.3 percent decline recorded in January, and the worst result since October 2009. The fall in the PPI reflects the broader weakness in global commodity prices, which has pushed down the price of the industrial inputs that make up a heavy portion of the indicator. Analysts said the PPI decline can hardly bottom out in the absence of significant improvements in property investment and overcapacity problems. 

Financial analysts generally believe that there is no inflationary risk at the horizon and risks are for further disinflationary pressures. To offset headwinds to economic growth, they expect monetary policy to be loosened further. In fact, with factory prices entrenched in deflation, a favorable environment has been created for further stimulus from the government. The central People's Bank of China cut benchmark deposit and lending interest rates in February for the second time in three months, citing ""historically low inflation"". 

The country's annual consumer inflation was 2 percent in 2014, well below the government's target of 3.5 percent. The annual government work report, delivered by Premier Li Keqiang at the opening of the national legislature's annual session, set this year's economic growth target at around 7 percent and inflation control target at around 3 percent. This is in line with the worldwide trend. Since 2014, major global economies have stepped up monetary stimulus measures in efforts to counter deflation and boost sluggish economic growth. 

Economists are increasingly worried that China -- a key driver of global growth -- is heading for a debilitating deflationary spiral, such as that which has plagued Japan for years. China's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.4 percent last year, its worst result since 1990, as authorities seek to transform the Asian giant's growth model to one in which consumer spending takes over as the key engine.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/510144665792915/?type=3,2015-03-10 22:08:38,3,0,6,3,0,0,0,0,0

The growth of China's exports has become a relief as the country's domestic investment momentum is struggling.
 
The latest trade figures indicate that exports surged 48.9 percent in February from a year earlier. Together with January, overseas sales rose 15 percent. Although the number was skewed by distortions from the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, the gain has nevertheless exceeded the median analyst forecast for a 14 percent jump while the Chinese government is only targeting a 6 percent gain in trade for 2015 from the 7.5-percent goal set for 2014.

Economic analysts believe that the U.S. economic recovery has helped drive China's export as the country seeks to cut excess capacity and transition to reliance on domestic consumption rather than infrastructure spending that would fuel the accumulation of debt. Exports to the U.S. in the first two months jumped 21 percent in yuan terms. If exports are good, less can be done in other aspects such as infrastructure investment. But whether China can continue to do so will depend in part on the U.S., where labor data last week showed employers added more jobs than forecast in February and the jobless rate fell to the lowest since 2008. The Bloomberg News Agency has quoted expert estimates as saying that a 3 percent expansion in the American economy will add an additional 0.5 to 1 percentage point to China's growth by boosting the exports by 8 to 9 percent.

Meanwhile, imports plunged by 20.1 percent in February, and the drop was sharper than the median estimate of a 10 percent decline, signaling continued weakness in internal demand as well as the fall in commodity prices. The trade surplus for February was $60.6 billion, above January's record of $60 billion, according to the customs administration in Beijing. Some analysts said the import numbers reflected headwinds facing the world's second-biggest economy and they believed that producers may be seeking to maximize exports to compensate for weak domestic demand. Chinese companies usually followed their tradition of rushing to export before the holiday, which along with a carry-over effect from last year, caused the fluctuations in exports. 

The larger trade surplus, however, is expected to add uncertainty for the Chinese currency. The yuan has declined 1.2 percent against the dollar since January 15. China has cut interest rates twice since November and lowered the reserve-ratio requirement.

In his work report to the annual National People's Congress session last week, Premier Li Keqiang announced a 2015 economic growth target of about 7 percent, the lowest set in more than 15 years. Premier Li Keqiang also said challenges facing China's economy include overcapacity and insufficient innovation amid continued economic weakness. 

In fact, China's exports and imports denominated in yuan rose by a mere 2.3 percent in 2014, falling short of the target for a third consecutive year. This year's later-than-usual lunar new year holidays -- when much of China shuts down -- distorted the February figures. Economists hope that imports may show some improvement in March after China's policy makers add stimulus.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/508999295907452/?type=3,2015-03-08 22:44:52,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0

223495844457800_504388679701847,"Chinese Courts to Abolish Practice of Forcing Defendants to Wear Prison Suits
   
A new ban on having defendants stand before the court in prison outfits is part of a new round of reforms undertaken by China's Supreme People's Court to ensure independent trials and better protect the rights of the defendants. This is an indication that trial of a defendant in prison garb has been officially recognized as an affront to the dignity of the proceedings and as jeopardizing a defendant's due process right to a fair trial.

For those who have been inside a Chinese court, the uniforms with prison logos on the defendants are hard to miss. Sometimes defendants are seen shackled and usually wearing orange prison vests in courtrooms. Some are even held by the shoulders by police staff.

However, such a practice is coming to an end. 

Under new judicial rules being drafted, authorities are no longer allowed to bring defendant to trial in prison gear in a bid to avoid prejudicing the legal proceedings.

""Just because a person charged, it doesn't mean they're guilty. Only through debate during the trial can the defendant be found guilty or not. To better protect human rights, we are hopefully to proceed with this reform soon,"" said He Xiaorong, head of the Supreme People's Court's legal reform office.

The move by the Supreme People's Court is one of 65 different legal reforms authorities are working on in seven areas. The Supreme People's Court has set a timetable for each goal, aiming to ""preliminarily establish a socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics by 2018.""

One of the main goals of the changes is to create more judicial independence to try to eliminate official interference in court cases.

Li Shaoping, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, explains that ""some officials interfere into cases by presenting materials, making phone calls or passing along messages. The courts need to set up a system to record the information and archive it.""

The reform plans also include an emphasis on the principal of ""judgement by evidence"" so as to create more judicial fairness.

It's expected that by the end of next year, the courts at all levels across #China will abide by a system where only legally-allowed evidence will be presented during trial.
 
At the same time, court judges themselves are going to come under more scrutiny. A new mechanism is going to be set up to hold judges more accountable for their actions.

The Supreme People's Court is also promising to make trials more transparent via live broadcasts or updates on social networks.

The sixth day of the Chinese New Year is also known as ""Ma Ri"" (the day of horse). According to traditional customs, families usually send away the ghost of poverty on this day. Different regions in China have different ways to send away the ghost of poverty, their wishes are the same, which is to send away poverty in the past and welcome the beautiful days in a new year.

According to the legend, the ghost of poverty is a son of Zhuan Xu (an emperor among the Three Emperor and Five Sovereigns in ancient China). He was short and weak, and liked wearing ragged clothes and eating poor porridge. Even when people presented him with new clothes, he would not wear it until he ripped it apart or burn it. So, he got the name of ""the man of poverty"", and with time passing by, he gradually became the ghost of poverty.

So, how to send away the ghost of poverty? Usually, people will throw away their ragged clothes, rubbish and other dirty things. In addition, they will also light some candles to lighten the road for the ghost of poverty. Last but not least, families should clean their toilets because the god of toilets will come to check the sanitation of the toilets.

Meitang, 8 at the time, visited his family with her parents. Pingru showed her his new toy which Meitang seemed to like very much.

After graduating from military school in 1946, the 26-year-old Pingru went to Meitang's home with his father as the two were expected to get engaged. He saw a young lady in her 20s putting on her lipstick by her window, marking his first impression of Meitang.

223495844457800_496171850523530,"Opinion: Smartphone Supremacy

===============

This past week has put a spotlight on smartphone brands as they continue to battle for dominance in China and around the world. The big news was Apple's record-breaking 18-billion-dollar quarterly profit figure; driven primarily by growing iPhone sales, which accounted for more than two-thirds of the company's 74.6 billion dollars in revenue. In China, Apple's sales were up 70 percent, putting it in first place in terms of units shipped in the 4th quarter of 2014.

Apple's sales rise coincides with Samsung's fall, but behind the two leaders are 13 Chinese smartphone companies, who together have a larger combined market share than either of the two giants. China's rapidly growing cadre of smartphone makers, Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo, and ZTE are collectively changing the market. They are poised to be the next big market movers, even as they compete ruthlessly amongst themselves. Using better designs, materials, technology, marketing, distribution and price points, they have been chewing steadily into Samsung's dominance by offering consumers what they want; more choices at better prices. Today, 10 of the top 17 cell phone makers are Chinese; including 3 of the top 5. In 2010 there was only one, ZTE, in the top 5.

The days when Chinese-made smartphones represented poor quality knockoffs have since faded. Sure, you can still find kooky knockoffs online for absurdly cheap prices, but today Chinese smartphone vendors deliver the most bang-for-the-buck, and they are moving aggressively into international markets.

While many pundits predict that the market is more about brands and operating systems, Chinese companies are changing the competitive landscape by designing and adapting their smartphones around the demands of the consumer. Looking at Apple's latest success, there are wisps of darkness. Why did it take so long for Apple to simply give their fan base what they envied in Android devices: bigger screens? In view of this, was the record quarter a trend or a windfall? If it was a signal that Apple will be following market trends more closely in the future, that's great; but how will they square this with their traditional ""one icon to serve all"" tradition? Apple will also have to contend with Chinese companies who are creating an iOS experience, with similar physical design aesthetics on devices running Android.

For smartphone competition, OS war is crucial. Despite some temporary gains, the major operating system (OS) war between Apple's iOS and Google's Android, continues to be won by Android. The other operating systems offered by Nokia, Microsoft and BlackBerry are marginal and fading fast. This is crucial to the Chinese companies who have thrown in with Android. But far from just following the crowd, Chinese companies like Xiaomi are adding their own secret sauce using their proprietary MIUI Android overlay. Their latest version MIUI 6 delivers an Apple like iOS experience at half the price.

Conventional wisdom is that, from an operating system perspective, Android devices will drive volume, while iOS devices will drive revenues. By 2018, Android is projected to control 80 percent of all global smartphones shipped and 61 percent of revenues, while iOS is projected to control only 13 percent of volumes but 34 percent of revenues.

The only fly in this ointment is the evolution of raw processing power that these phones are acquiring, which will allow many of them to be able to handle more complex operating systems. This is probably what Microsoft is hoping for with their new Windows 10 OS, which will work on phones, tablets, laptops and desktops. In fact, the rapid increase in raw computing power will in essence make the smartphone a rival to desktop and laptop computers. Envision a day when you simply plug in or connect wirelessly to a home or office monitor, keyboard, mouse and printer using your smartphone as your computer; it is not so far off.

While facing fierce market competition, each of the Chinese smartphone makers has their own approach, and the top companies exemplify different strategies. Xiaomi's approach, started in 2010 by a consortium of eight partners including Temasek Holdings, IDG Capital, Qiming Venture Partners and Qualcomm, has experienced the fastest growth. In the third quarter of 2014, it became the world's third-largest handset maker after Samsung and Apple, with a 211 percent year-on-year surge in shipments, according to data from industry consultancy IDC.

Xiaomi's Mi Note was launched at the end of January. It sold out in three minutes. The Mi Note also boasts impressive specs, packing more RAM, a bigger battery and a more powerful camera than the iPhone 6 for significantly less, 370 U.S. dollars, vs. a base iPhone at 749 U.S. dollars. With early reviews of the Mi Note being highly positive, no excess inventory, and lower sales costs due to direct online sales, the founder and CEO Lei Jun is forecasting 100 million in sales for 2015; up from 61.1 million in 2014.

The key to Xiaomi's model is getting rid of the 20 to 25 percent cut that retailers/distributors typically get, and instead using the Internet to sell directly to an increasingly Internet savvy Chinese population. Earnings from accessories and web services help overcome the lower margins earned on the phones themselves.

The end result - phones that consumers love, absolutely nothing like the cheap knockoffs traditionally associated with Chinese manufacturers of days gone by. In going after the premium end of the market, Xiaomi has in essence declared war on the fat margins and business-as-usual practices of its bigger competitors.

The only question is can Xiaomi run fast enough to keep ahead of its competition. Because, while brilliant, everything except its MIUI Android overlay can be easily replicated and adopted by its competitors. With this in mind, people will be looking at its December 29, 2014, forty-six billion dollar valuation.

If Xiaomi is a rabbit, then Huawei is a giant. As a diversified technology company whose emphasis is research and development, Huawei relies on developing its own technology, and as such its approach is diametrically opposite that of Xiaomi's. Huawei phones do use some internationally sourced components from companies like Sony and Samsung, but the heart of the phone is a proprietary Kirin 925 chipset, developed and owned by Huawei.

Started in 1987, it is one of China's foremost technology companies famed for its growth and investment in technology research and development. It has joint ventures and working relations with over 80 percent of the world's top 50 technology companies. Its founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei is legendary for his business acumen and success.

Huawei's 2014 revenues were at least 287 billion yuan (46.3 billion dollars), up from 239 billion yuan in 2013. Operating profits were between 33.9 and 34.3 billion yuan. Sales growth was led by a 32 percent rise in consumer business due to the increasing popularity of its mid- to high-end smartphones. They also clocked a 27 percent increase in a unit which provides cloud computing and data projects to businesses. While only part of Huawei's massive book of business, it is clear that the company wants to be a dominant player in the smartphone field and to Huawei that means developing and controlling the technology.

In the first week of January, at the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) 2015, Huawei was featuring its Huawei P7, Mate 7, Honor 6 and Honor 6 Plus. Huawei is expected to unveil its Mate 7 Compact in March at the Mobile World Congress (MWC). These offerings are aimed at the premium end of the market, offering consumers high quality devices with a different mix of features, technology and prices. Their main competitors are not Samsung and Apple though; it is the other Chinese smartphone makers; in particular Xiaomi. Its Mate 7, at 2,999 yuan will be a direct competitor in terms of features and price to the Mi Note. However, Huawei's own Emotion UI skin for Android is not as highly regarded as Xiaomi's MIUI.

Xiaomi and Huawei now basically have the same product offerings and target consumers, and the frequent spats between the two firms indicate that the rivalry is heating up. In 2014, Xiaomi's total shipments reached 61 million units, compared with 75 million units for Huawei. The question for Huawei is will it be able to develop its proprietary technology more efficiently than its competitors. Currently, its Kirin 925 chipset is regarded as good but not the best. Part of this problem is that companies like Qualcomm can spread their costs and earn profits by selling to multiple phone manufacturers. To be competitive Huawei might have to do the same, which would in essence erode its competitive edge.

Under this development, Apple may have had a fantastic quarter, but unless it pulls a significant rabbit out of its hat, it may not happen again. A new day is in dawning on the smartphone market, Apple and Samsung now face vigorous competition form a pack of hungry and feisty Chinese competitors who are using a variety of strategies to climb to the top of the mountain. Chinese companies are geared for smaller margins; they have proprietary technology; they are fast and they have developed more efficient marketing and distribution methods. Against this, the slower moving Apple and Samsung with their fatter margins and business-as-usual approach will be easy marks.

223495844457800_492013720939343,"Opinion: Where Does Chinese Football Go from Here?

Having bowed out of the Asian Cup after an admirable display against hosts Australia, the Chinese national side can now reflect on what was ultimately a successful cup run despite the disappointment of not being able to reach the semifinals. While not really being able to mount much offence against a classy Australian outfit, the Chinese team had already given many Chinese football fans a pleasant surprise by winning all three of their qualifiers and topping their group. The question that those within the football hierarchy in China should now ask is, where can the country go from here?

In the same week as reaching the quarterfinals of the Asian Cup, China also saw one of its own citizens, real estate tycoon and head of Dalian Wanda, Wang Jianlin, buy a 20 percent stake in the Spanish club Atletico Madrid for around 45 million euros. The acquisition comes with promises from the club to help improve grassroots football in China; a long-term project which the government has already acknowledged and is paying attention to.

Wang himself seems to think his involvement with a quality side such as Atletico will have a positive impact on the Chinese domestic scene, as evidenced by a statement made after announcing the purchase. Wang noted, ""This investment will not only provide a golden opportunity for young Chinese players sent overseas by Wanda to be selected by leading European football clubs, it will also strengthen the quality of Chinese football and narrow the gap between China and the rest of the world.""

Whether that happens or not is anyone's guess, but Wang will most likely have to push hard and spearhead any efforts on the part of Atletico to improve the game here. Though such a move will no doubt be one that Atletico's directors will be keen to pursue, if only to raise the profile of the club in a fast growing market where fans are more prone to support foreign teams than domestic ones.

Corruption and match-fixing scandals have dogged Chinese football in the past, turning many off the game. However, at the same time, clubs still enjoy high gates, on par with other top teams around the world. A surge of foreign players on large playing contracts led to not much more than a ripple in terms of international coverage; only to be followed by the unceremonious exits of many ""top"" players such as Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka.

The Chinese FA's decision to align themselves with David Beckham as an ambassador of the Chinese Super League looks to be nothing more than a PR stunt, and Beckham himself seems to have as much knowledge of the state of Chinese grassroots football as the average man on the street. The move to appoint top coaches might be different, as Lippi's stint with Guangzhou Evergrande has proved. Though the debacle with former head coach of the national side Jose Antonio Camacho, who the CFA had to pay an astronomical fee to remove from his position, still rankles for many Chinese supporters.

It is time for the CFA and CSL to distance itself from the past and move away from David Beckham style gimmicks, because despite the amount of coverage achieved in the short term, the only net result is a fatter wallet for Mr. Beckham without any real, measurable improvement at the grassroots level of the game. Following China's ""success"" at the Asian Cup, reports which immediately decry the ability of the Chinese game, such as the one that appeared in the Economist December 13, 2014 edition, will no doubt subside for a while. China's FIFA ranking is still pretty poor, only just making it into the top 100, but ironically China is currently placed above Australia, proving that one should place very little stock in the rankings in terms of assessing a country's ability.

The anger and outrage voiced by Chinese fans after their national team was defeated 5-1 by a Thai youth team in mid-2013 is currently absent from discussions about the Chinese squad. However, that's not to say that it won't return in the future if China is unable to maintain respectable form on the pitch. The press often points out the baffling nature of China's size in comparison to its ability, or inability, to produce world class football players. But such comparisons are not useful. Footballing infrastructure has been sorely lacking from high schools and the lack of any organized school leagues is yet another reason as to why youngsters are not emerging or being spotted in China.

Luckily, Chinese fans have a habit of setting their expectations low when it comes to the national team. The success of China in the Asian Cup was all the more enjoyable because Chinese football fans did not expect to get out of their group, let alone have a chance of reaching the semi-finals. But that's not to say that fans should continue to maintain low expectations. They should call for increased investment at the grassroots level, and the government should expand its China School Football Programme which was first initiated in 2009. Furthermore, calling upon the skills and expertise of coaches who are experienced at the grassroots is vital. The government knows this, hence why they brought in Tom Byer, a grassroots guru who contributed greatly to Japan's football development in the 1990s and 2000s.

Government administrators, often tasked with taking charge of development within a certain sport, should not rest on their laurels following the surprising turn of events in the Asian Cup. The fact that China's progression was such a surprise just proves that there is a lot to be done in order to get to a point in time where fans expect progression, rather than failure.

223495844457800_488824571258258,"Preview of Barack Obama's State of the Union Address

US President Barack Obama is scheduled to give his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday.

Political pundits say there are no big surprises to expect. But it may include some smaller initiatives that can change the lives of millions of Americans.

Obama has pushed hard to implement his agenda even after the Republicans took control of Congress. His efforts include the hotly debated Presidential decree halting the deportation of illegal immigrants and reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba that has stalled for almost half a century.

However, the US media and political pundits all say that they are not expecting much from the President's upcoming State of Union address.

Allan Lichtman is a History Professor at the American University.
He says the annual Presidential address, despite all the fanfare, was a rather ""boring"" affair. He doesn't foresee any grand initiatives that might be announced in the upcoming address. But there are some smaller changes that could still have a large impact.

""He has certainly signaled he is going to push for a program to provide free two-year's of community college for high school graduates across the country.""

This is among the three new proposals that President Obama has unveiled in the week leading up to his address. The other two focuses on strengthening cyber security and expanding broadband access and giving workers paid family leave.

But Congress has a tendency to sideline the policy proposals which the President unveils. This year, Obama faces an uphill battle to convince the congress led by Republicans to increase government spending to implement such policies.

Prof. Allan Lichtman again.

""I think that there are a couple of things that they could agree on, and I think I pointed some of those out. Cyber security – I mean, that's pretty non-controversial. Perhaps some kind of tax reform, but I'm much less optimistic about that. And perhaps the Trans-Pacific Partnership.""

According to Lichtman, the State of the Union address is more of a ritual to pump up the spirits of the American people.

""No. 1, an expression, of course, that the union is strong. He's got a lot of positive things that he could point to, most notably a finally strong recovery with a rapidly growing economy, with job creation that we haven't seen since the 1990s, unemployment almost cut in half down from a peak of close – around 10 percent down to the middle 5 percent range. If you look at the consumer confidence index, it's the highest it's been in a very long time.""

In addition to focusing on domestic challenges and the economy, Obama is also expected to touch upon the challenges abroad. This year, ISIS and Iran are expected to top his list of concerns.

""He, of course, is going to talk about the challenges abroad, the strong response to ISIS, the continuing negotiations with Iran, and will, I think, plead with Congress not to impose new sanctions on Iran.""

This year the White House is also searching for new ways to spread the key message delivered in the speech. Therefore, for the first time Obama's first big post-speech interview will be broadcast online via YouTube and not via traditional media like established newspapers or even a TV news channel.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/488824571258258/?type=3,2015-01-18 21:31:35,10,0,1,10,0,0,0,0,0
223495844457800_487822164691832,"【Opinion: A Bright Future for China and Latin America】

China has renewed its pledge to strengthen trade and investment ties with Latin America. On the first China-CELAC Forum recently concluded in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that China's investment in Latin America will reach $250 billion and that the volume of two-way trade will double to $500 billion in the next decade.

For more on this topic, CRI talked to Professor Yang Zhimin of the Institute of Latin American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The professor points out that after the financial crisis, both Latin America and China face some difficulties, but China has huge imports, outbound investment as well as outbound tourists, which provide big opportunities for Latin America.

As for the conflicts between Chinese companies and Latin Americans, Yang suggests that Chinese companies should be familiar with the local situation as well as have a plan about how to protect the environment and communicate with locals. More importantly, Chinese companies need to make the Latin American people understand the potential benefits of the project.

Yang's analysis shows that increasing trade friction is from the countries' similar economic structures, especially concerning the exporting of goods. If both sides had more developed high-end economic structure, they could avoid some frictions.

The Chinese economy is now developing under a ""new norm"", which means that China has been moving toward a development model based more on domestic consumption, rather than exports and investment. That means China will consume more products, which will not only be produced in China but also in other countries including Latin American nations. Besides, a more stable Chinese economy will be a more stable engine for Latin America as Latin America increasingly depends on Chinese economic growth.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/487822164691832/?type=3,2015-01-16 00:19:04,18,0,5,18,0,0,0,0,0
223495844457800_487108008096581,"An investigation is ongoing for the latest episode of anti-terror developments in China.

Police in Shanghai have detained 10 Turkish nationals who allegedly provided assistance for terror suspects in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

According to the Beijing-based Global Times newspaper, 11 other people, including 9 terror suspects from Xinjiang, were also taken into custody in November 2014.

The newspaper says the 10 Turkish detainees are accused of providing fake Turkish passports for terror suspects. The alleged terrorists were trying to leave China illegally through Shanghai Pudong Airport. Each of them had paid 60 thousand yuan for an illegal passport.

Audio and video materials related to terrorism were found among the suspects who were trying to leave China, according to the report.

They had been bound for Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

The Global Times report says the 10 Turkish nationals have been officially arrested on charges of making arrangements for others to illegally cross national borders.

According to Chinese law, the crime carries a sentence of 2 to 7 years in prison. If there are aggravating circumstances, those convicted could be sentenced to 7 years to life in prison.

Meanwhile, authorities in Xinjiang have announced that people who buy fireworks and firecrackers for Chinese New Year will have to register using their ID cards.

A local official says this is in part to prevent terrorists from obtaining raw materials to make explosive devices.

Firework retail outlets will need to record the type and quantity of products purchased by each customer.

Earlier this week, police in Shule County in Xinjiang shot dead six attackers who attempted to detonate explosive devices attached to their bodies.

The Chinese government has engaged in cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral level to gain support for its efforts to combat terrorism and ethnic separatism, following the September 11 attacks in the United States, which led to the global War on Terror.

223495844457800_486794991461216,"The latest case about a five-year-old girl contracting HIV through a blood transfusion in southeast China's Fujian province has shone a light on an issue that has long bedeviled the country. But there is no cause for alarm. What's important is the heart-wrenching story has prompted China's top health authority to be demanding blood-collection stations across the nation to use better testing methods to detect viruses.

The local health authority has ruled out any wrongdoing by the blood center or the hospital where she had a heart surgery four years ago. An official investigation has concluded that one of eight donors whose blood was used during the operation was in a ""window period"" during which the viral load is too low to be detected. The donor was later found to have HIV. So ""neither the hospital nor the blood centre had broken any law"". But a Xinhua News Agency report said that the same donor's blood was also used for two other operations, and officials are trying to track down the patients, 

The National Health and Family Planning Commission has promised to lower such risks in the future by adopting the Nucleic Acid Test, or NAT. Experts believe that theoretically speaking, the NAT could sharply shorten the window period. For example, using traditional testing methods, it takes about 20 days for HIV antigens to be detected. But using the NAT, it takes only 10 days.

It is true that current technology doesn't allow for a condition of zero-risk and the rest of the world is facing the challenge as well. However, that doesn't mean the government can afford to be complacent about its management of HIV/AIDS and efforts to control HIV infection. 

Nearly half a million people are living with HIV/AIDS in China, according to figures released last month by the National Health and Family Planning Commission. In the 1990s, rural parts of China -- particularly the central province of Henan -- were hit by the country's most debilitating AIDS epidemic. It stemmed from a tainted government-backed blood donation program and infected tens of thousands of people, including entire villages.

Currently, sexual transmission accounts for more than 90 percent of infections, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. But transmission through blood transfusions remains an issue. Official figures indicate that about 10 people in China annually are infected with HIV through blood transfusions. By contrast, the last two such cases in the US took place in 2008 and 2002, according to the UK-based charity AVERT. Screening of donors' blood led to the detection of 2,237 cases of HIV/AIDS in the first 10 months of 2014. Much room remains for remedying the loopholes in the system in the interests of the safety of many people. People's Daily reported last month that Fujian health authorities had called on people who engaged in high-risk sex not to donate blood. 

Authorities found no irregularities in blood that was drawn and used at the time of the five-year-old girl's surgery. Nor were there irregularities among staff or the institutions involved. So it was not a medical blunder. Sadly speaking, it was the girl's misfortune to have been the one case in 500,000 to be given HIV-contaminated blood during a window period. Since the blood centre and hospital were not faulted, the hospital will offer compensation on humanitarian grounds, by covering economic losses and helping the girl with her education and treatment, in accordance with the national policy. However, the girl's mother was reported to be critical of the way she had been treated by medical officials for cold-hearted bureaucracy and lack of sympathy. She said she even thought of committing suicide with her girl once and for all. In the long run, experts believe that a compensation system needs to be established by introducing insurance, a fund and counseling experts to provide psychological guidance.",No cause for alarm over transfusion related HIV infection,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.486794971461218.1073741870.223495844457800/486794991461216/?type=3,2015-01-13 03:21:48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sweden's Stockholm University is ending its partnership with the local Confucius Institute.

The university says it decided against extending the agreement with the Stockholm Confucius Institute when it came up for renewal at the end of last year.

""Generally speaking, establishing institutes that are funded by another nation, within the framework of a university, is rather a questionable practice."" Vice-chancellor Astrid Soderbergh Widding explains.

She adds that the partnership has become redundant over the past decade, as academic exchanges between China and Sweden have evolved.

Confucius institutes are funded by the Chinese government through the Chinese Language Council International, or Hanban. But unlike other cultural promotion agencies such as British Council and Goethe-Institut of Germany, the institutes operate within established schools, and provide funding, teachers and educational materials.

223495844457800_484748468332535,"Opinion: The Global Economy Outlook in 2015 

As we enter a new year, the question is--what's the outlook for the world economy in 2015?

The consensus of international and CRI economic commentators is--""not bad"". So what does that mean and what should you be paying attention to, as you look towards the future?

Putting things in context, we are in a decade still struggling with the fallout of the 2007 economic meltdown, increasing wealth disparity, growing unemployment, rising nationalism, waxing geopolitical competition, unstable governments, ineffective leadership, severe pollution, water crisis, increasing severity of weather disasters, aging populations in developed countries, rampant population growth in undeveloped countries and conflicting ideologically based world views.

Against this backdrop, 2015 will be in part shaped by these larger issues, but more immediately by the political events in the Middle East, Ukraine and Africa, and economically on the effects of lower energy and commodity prices, and the various quantitative easing programs in the US, EU and Japan.

The two biggest positive economic drivers will be the US and China. As the US economy heats up, China ""normalizes"", the EU drifts, Russia suffers, Afghanistan, the Middle East and North Africa unravel and Abenomics rules Japan, the world's number one and two economies will need to be the world's engine. The IMF predicts a 3.8% world growth rate in 2015, up from 3.3% last year, an optimistic projection, which is largely negative on growth in the EU, Russia and Japan. If it comes true, it would be the fastest growth since 2011.

So what are the major economic and political issues to watch in 2015?

Oil and commodity price declines will provide a positive boot for consumers in developed countries, which rely on imported energy and materials, but will put more pressure on energy and resource dependent exporters, many of whom are already on politically unstable ground. The extra money in consumer pockets will help with consumer purchases, which should help lower cost exports from China and other developing nations.

Quantitative easing, as the US continues to unwind its fiscal stimulus efforts, the EU and Japan have embarked on another round to try to stimulate their flagging economies. Questions remain about when and how Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates. We believe the answer will come at the June Fed meeting. The danger to the world economy is that a resurgent US economy, geo-political uncertainty and actions by the Fed will reverse hot money flows which had been supporting investment led growth in underdeveloped and developing countries. 

On a macro level, the question is what, if anything, can/will China do to protect and stabilize its neighbors in Asia. On a micro level, China should be largely insulated by its booming domestic markets, reserves and safe haven status. Questions remain about the impact of the EU's and Japan's quantitative easing programs, both domestically and internationally. 

Ukraine will continue to be a sore spot between Russia and the US, but an economically fragile EU may be a reluctant ongoing sanctions partner, as the realities of low growth continue to push populist dissatisfaction. It will continue the game of musical economic chairs, as Russia is forced to adjust its imports and exports markets eastward, as EU companies seek to replace lost markets. The decline in energy and resources is the most serious threat to Russia. All of these factors will continue Russia's move towards China as much out of political as economic necessity.

With a fresh electoral victory, Shinzo Abe will continue to implement Abenomics in Japan. The question is--will it work? So far, it has produced little other than temporary stock market gains. Japan should be a net gainer as energy and resource prices go down, but will it be enough to get the reluctant Japanese industrial combines to invest in Japan? 

After engaging in the same give-away politics, Abe is looking to impose a sales tax increase to solve Japan's massive debts and chronic deficits. The difficulty is the first round of sales tax increases had the same negative effect on spending as it did when it was tried previously in 1997. Why a second round of tax increases would succeed, where the others failed, has not been addressed.

The EU will continue to struggle with its lack of fiscal union and increasing political dissatisfaction. Individually, EU member countries will continue to struggle with the high costs of their social welfare net, rising right wing factions and stagnant economies. Great Britain, although looking better in the short run, has a long-term property asset bubble issue.

India will continue to be on hold economically until 2016. This is the minimum amount of time Modi needs to consolidate his party's power in the upper house (short of a political alliance) in order to pass his sweeping economic proposals.

Afghanistan, the Middle East and North Africa will continue to be a source of political, economic and social instability, exacerbated by terrorism, unemployment, wars, refugees, water/food crisis and the decline in energy and resource revenues.

For China, 2015 will be an important year in its ongoing economic reform and restructuring. To avoid the ""middle income trap"", China must become more efficient and competitive. As wages and the cost of doing business go up in China, the point where cheap labor can counterbalance the inefficient use of resources is fast disappearing. China must climb the value chain or watch the economic miracle stop. Balancing an investment led export driven economy with consumption, services and innovation is a difficult undertaking. As part of the efforts, China is following a new political economic model which reverses the Western concept of market on top, government below and instead puts social values and goals on top and uses the market as an efficiency tool. 

China is currently benefiting from the political and economic winds and together, its economic, political and social reform measures are taking hold. For those who want to understand in detail China's road map, they should read Xi Jinping's The Governance of China. For China, the tasks will be in the details, as it seeks to stimulate SME driven innovation and efficiency, which have given three out of five of the top cell phone makers, while still retaining the market heft of SOEs who can compete domestically and internationally in areas like energy and the high-speed train market.

The good news is that despite rumbling sources of potential trouble, there is a decent chance that 2015 will be another year of rehabilitation for the economy, if the US and China can act as the engine for the world's lagging economy.

2015 is approaching. It's a time to ring out the old year and bring in the new, on behalf of China Radio International and myself, I'd like to express my earnest greetings and best wishes to everyone and wish you a happy New Year, and a life of happiness and good health.

China celebrated its 65th birthday in 2014. The Chinese people have taken a firm step on the road to realizing the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. The year 2015 is the first year of China's drive to comprehensively deepen reforms. CRI has also embarked on a new era in its journey of building a modern, comprehensive and innovative international media group.

Friends across the world continued to pay attention to China and CRI in 2014. Just like Australian listener Roland Neo said: ""CRI shows me that China with its economy taking off is playing a more and more important role on the global stage. Thank you for making us so close to China!""

Dear friends, your attention and encouragement are the greatest motivation for us to move forward. I'm here to express my sincere gratitude to you!

In the past year, we have paid close attention to every corner of the world through our reporters and editors all over the world. We're glad for the mild recovery of the world economy. We also show our admiration to people who make efforts to improve their living environment, and sympathize with our friends suffering from the rampant Ebola virus from the bottom of our hearts. 

Today, although we are in different countries, our connection has become closer and more widespread. The world has become a community of shared destiny, merging and interdependent with each other.

Interaction leads human development and communication makes civilization magnificent!

China is trying to understand the world, and hopes that the world and our friends will understand China better. Only through enhancing understanding can there be more trust and cooperation, fewer misunderstandings and conflicts.

The major job of CRI is to let China understand the world, let the world understand China, and promote communication and friendship between the Chinese people and people in other countries.

We will provide a Chinese perspective to the world, introduce a Chinese value, report a Chinese way of observing and perceiving the world, and tell friends more excellent stories happening in this oriental country.

We will introduce more events in the rest of the world to the Chinese people, share more touching stories happening in your countries, and let the Chinese people understand the world, including our friends' recognition and opinions towards China. 

During the modern era in which the Internet continues developing, there's dissemination of information everywhere. The world is big, but not far away!

At present, CRI broadcasts in 65 languages. It covers the world via a wide range of communication means, including radio, television, newspaper, Internet and mobile phone.

In the New Year, we will speed up the development of integration of multiple media forms, especially to share news and stories happening across the world with friends via the new communication channel and means in the Internet era. We believe new communication means will bring us closer to our friends, make our communication and interaction more convenient and faster, and further promote our mutual understanding and friendship.

223495844457800_480255758781806,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has delivered a New Year speech to a domestic and overseas audience via China Radio International, China National Radio and China Central Television.

Here is the entire speech.

Ladies and gentlemen, comrades and friends:

Time flies. Year 2014 is coming to an end and 2015 is approaching. At this turn of the year, I now extend my best wishes to people of all ethnic groups in China, to our compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions, to compatriots in Taiwan and overseas Chinese, as well as to friends in other countries and regions in the world.

2014 is unforgettable. In the past year, we pushed forward reforms with strong commitment, conquered many hardships and introduced a series of important reform measures, many of which are closely associated with the interests of the general public. We worked to adapt to the new normal of economic growth and actively pushed forward economic and social development, resulting in further improvement in people's lives. On December 12, the first phase of the central route of Water Diversion Project from South to North was officially completed. More than 400,000 residents along the route were relocated. We pay our sincere tributes to them for their sacrifice, and wish them a happy life in their new homes. 

In the past year, we endeavored to improve our work style and strengthen party and government discipline, with efforts focusing on fighting against formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance. The situation has greatly improved. We stepped up our efforts in our crackdown on corruption, and severely punished corrupt officials with zero tolerance. This demonstrates that we are strongly committed to fighting against corruption and other evil forces. In the past year, we enhanced our cooperation and exchanges with countries in the world. We hosted the informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization in Beijing. Chinese leaders visited many countries and received many foreign leaders. Such exchanges of visits have helped the rest of the world understand China better.

Officials at various levels have also spared no efforts performing their duty. Of course, those achievements would not have been possible without the support of the people. I would like to salute our great people.

In the past year, through legislation we established the Commemorative Day to mark the victory of Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, the Commemorative Day of Martyrs, and the National Memorial Day to commemorate victims in the Nanjing Massacre. Solemn ceremonies were held on these days. Despite the change of times, we would always remember the sacrifice and contribution of those who gave their lives for the Chinese nation and for peace.

In the past year, we also recorded sad moments. We remember the more than 150 Chinese compatriots still missing after the loss of the Malaysian Airline flight MH370. We will continue our efforts to locate their whereabouts. In the past year, China suffered from a number of natural disasters and tragic work safety accidents, in which some compatriots lost their lives. The Ludian earthquake in Yunnan Province claimed more than 600 lives. Our hearts are with them and we wish their families all the best.

The New Year bell is about to ring. We will continue our efforts to act upon people's expectations and turn their aspirations into reality. We will continue to deepen the reform in an all-round way. This is an unstoppable train. Only those who brave hardships would prevail. We will push forward the rule of law in an all-round way, safeguard the rights of people in line with law, maintain social justice and promote national development. For an eventual accomplishment of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way in due time, both deepening the reforms and strengthening the rule of law should function as the two wings of a bird, or as wheels on both sides of a vehicle,

People's lives in our country are enjoying constant improvement, but we will always remember those still living in hardships. We will work with passion to improve their well-being, with efforts focusing on poverty-alleviation and guaranteeing basic living conditions. We will provide assistance to all those in need of help, including poverty-stricken farmers and urban residents with difficulties, so that their basic living conditions are guaranteed and they feel the warmth of care being in this society.

We will continue to comprehensively push forward strict party discipline, never hesitate in improving our work style. We will always resort to the anti-corruption drive as a sharp weapon, and consolidate mechanism-building as a cage to contain powers. In this socialist country led by the Communist Party of China, every corrupt official must be dealt with once evidence is found. There's absolutely no tolerance for corruption and graft.

We're engaged in a lofty mission. Only perseverance will lead to victory, while giving up halfway will end up with failure to do whatever. Our blueprint is magnificent, but our struggle will certainly be arduous. All party members and people of all ethnic groups in the country must be united as one, draw on collective wisdom and useful ideas to grasp opportunities, jointly face challenges with united strength, conquer problems with quick action, be bold to carry on innovation, making China a better country year by year and constantly improving people's lives.

Chinese people are not only concerned with the prospect of our own country, but also that of the whole world. We helped African people fight against the Ebola epidemic, and assisted people in the Maldivian capital suffering from severe water shortages. Many of those moves showed that Chinese people share weal and woe with people in the world. The world is still not stable enough. We long for peace and sincerely wish that global efforts will help relieve all people from hunger, all families from war, and ensure that all children grow in peace and in sunshine.",,status,,2014-12-31 06:06:38,21,3,4,21,0,0,0,0,0
223495844457800_480107472129968,"China and the ruble crisis

    The ruble seems to have stabilized, at least temporarily if not for the long term, at about 60 per dollar. The Russian Government has declared the end of the free fall of the value of their currency. But everyone concurs that the year 2015 will remain testy for the Russian economy and the ruble, given the expected low oil prices and ongoing Ukraine problem. So what can Moscow do to fend off more potential risks?

    There is no doubt that Russia will largely tackle the crisis on its own, either by alleviating the impacts of Western sanctions or by strengthening monetary policymaking. But if the need for external assistance rises, China will for sure step into the breach because the International Monetary Fund, which as a U.S.-controlled institution, has found no reason to extend a hand to the Russians.

    China has made clear its willingness to help quiet the stormy situation with the ruble. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said recently: ""Russia has the capability and the wisdom to overcome existing hardships in the economic situation. If the Russian side needs, we will provide necessary assistance within our capacity.""

    The remarks alone are believed to have already played its due role in shoring up confidence in the ruble and the Russian economy because they can be read as a strong signal that ""China will come to the rescue."" Coincidently maybe, the Russian currency stopped its plunge last week and recovered some of its lost ground from the previous week when it was hit at 80 per dollar.

    Wang is right in pointing out that Russia has the capability to overcome the current challenges. There are two rainy-day funds in Russia intended to support the national economy at times of crisis: the Reserve Fund and the National Welfare Fund. The Reserve Fund contributes to economic stability by reducing inflationary pressure, which is expected to shoot up next year, and insulates the economy from outside volatility, such as extremely low oil and gas prices.

    One Russian official noted, ""Next year we will, without a doubt, have to bring the Reserve Fund into play."" So there are still some options in their toolbox.

    China has a national interest in seeing a stable Russia. There's a spillover effect of the ruble crisis into neighboring countries, including Belarus, China and many others. Also, there have already been talks of capital flight in emerging economies, something similar to what happened in Russia, as the U.S. Fed is expected to increase interest rates and the dollar continues to appreciate.

    In addition, China and Russia need each other to protect their global strategic interests in the international arena. If Russia is weakened in its political standing, China is likely to suffer too.

    But China is cautious in whatever assistance it might extend to Moscow. It doesn't want to be seen as a ""rescuer"" to the Russians, who could find it embarrassing, similar to how Moscow was once viewed as a big brother to China.

    A high-profile bailout program by China could also be regarded as strengthening the China-Russia alliance against the U.S., which is bent on pressuring Moscow to withdraw from involving in the Ukraine crisis.

    Domestically speaking, Chinese policymakers have to take into consideration public opinion, which is increasingly critical of some of China's international aid programs. The argument is not totally without merit since there are 92 million people living in poverty in China.

    It is no wonder then that Foreign Minister Wang has been low-key in speaking of aiding the Russians and listed three conditions for Chinese assistance: 1) Russia asks for help; 2) It's necessary; 3) It should be within Chinese capacity, meaning there's probably no large-scale Chinese bailout.

    As a result, Chinese assistance is likely to come in the form of more investment in infrastructure projects or loans to Russian companies. That kind of aid is in line with the Chinese win-win doctrine, which serves not only Russian interests, but also Chinese ones.

223495844457800_478825255591523,"Beijing's public transportation price hike takes effect

The public transport in Beijing has begun to adopt new fares today, which double the current prices on average. However, the price hike does not seem to stop commuters from choosing public transport, especially subway.

Xu Hui, who lives in the capital's northern Tiantongyuan but works as an editor in downtown Beijing, has calculated the impact of the price hike.

Now, she will pay six yuan (less than 1 USD) for a single 24.2-kilometer trip, resulting in an extra 2,112 yuan annually. Previously, there was a flat 2 yuan rate for single tickets and unlimited transfers.

Under the new fare prices, the minimum price for a subway ride will be 3 yuan, which covers 6 km.

""I can accept it. Compared with traffic jams on the road, I still prefer the subway."" 

The subway fare will cost 4 yuan if the ride is between 6 and 12 km, 5 yuan for 12 to 22 km and 6 yuan for 22 to 32 km. If the subway ride is longer than 32 km, one yuan is charged for every extra 20 km.

For bus passengers, a ride of 10 km will be 2 yuan and 1 extra yuan for every 5 km after that. Smart card users will enjoy a 50 percent discount and student card users receive a 75 percent discount.

""I see relatively fewer passengers on Sunday morning on the subway, but there is no big difference,"" says a citizen surnamed Liu.

According to the Beijing Subway Group, the No. 4 Line received 40,000 passengers between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Sunday, an 8 percent drop compared with the same period of last Sunday.

Beijing is home to 21 million permanent residents. The city currently has 527 km of subway lines in operation, which carry 10 million passengers daily.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/478825255591523/?type=3,2014-12-28 10:25:22,14,1,2,14,0,0,0,0,0

According to a statement issued by the No. 3 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing, Yu and four companies involved in the case must pay 5 million yuan (roughly 800,000 USD) to the plaintiff, while Yu must also issue a public apology. 

Earlier this month, the court held hearings about the case. In her complaint, Chiung claimed that the plot of the TV series ""The Palace: The Lost Daughter"" had been taken straight out of her novel ""Plum Blossom Scar"". (In case anyone is curious, the former aired on Hunan Satellite TV in April, while the latter was adapted into a TV series that first aired in 1993.)

Chiung said the defendants had gained huge profits from plagiarizing her works. Meanwhile, she had been writing a new script based on the story of ""Plum Blossom Scar"", but the plagiarism became such a huge obstacle that she simply could not go on. She added that the incident caused her emotional damage.

Days after the hearings, 109 Chinese screenwriters voiced support for Chiung by signing a joint declaration. They said all forms of plagiarism are to be condemned and that they look forward to justice in the case.

The high-profile showdown has drawn wide discussion and massive media attention from the mainland and Taiwan, as Chiung is a household name in both places. 

Following the verdict, Yu's studio quickly released a statement, saying Yu would appeal.",Taiwan novelist wins high-profile plagiarism case,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.476981082442607.1073741866.223495844457800/476981085775940/?type=3,2014-12-25 05:42:17,4,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0
223495844457800_476355279171854,"China is to reform its pension system, in a bid to level out the massive pension gap between government employees and those working in enterprises. In the current dual system, the former receives a much higher pension after retirement than the latter.

At the ongoing bi-monthly session of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, Vice Premier Ma Kai talked a bit about the new system.

""We are going to establish an integrated pension system for government bodies and enterprises. The new pension scheme will include money paid by individuals and employers. We are also going to carry out a reform on how the numbers and rates are determined, in order to break the long-held dual system.""

The reform will be carried out nationwide simultaneously with reforms of the salary system.

The vice premier also said the national social security system has been established, while the recent measures are expanding its coverage.

""Based on an improved provincial reform, pension insurance should also be pushed forward at the national level. We will work out initiatives for clear-cut funding and paying responsibilities of central and local governments"".

As the Chinese population is expected to reach 1.43 billion in 2020, the State Council is trying to implement a pension system that covers everybody. Ma said the government hopes to cover 900 million people by 2017, and 1 billion in 2020, raising the coverage rate from the current 80 percent to 95 percent.",China to reform its pension system,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.476355272505188.1073741865.223495844457800/476355279171854/?type=3,2014-12-24 02:05:39,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
223495844457800_476065935867455,"Complaints about the media are nothing new in China. ""They are irresponsible!"" ""They are not trustworthy!"" ""They are lazy and never do due diligence!"" And the list goes on. For the most part, we can chalk it up to cynicism, because there are indeed people out there who just have to complain about anything and everything related to China.

But with the recent string of unfortunate incidents involving the Chinese media, one cannot help but think, maybe it's not just the cynics. The Chinese media do have a problem, a problem that is not universal, a problem that forces those with a conscience to ask: What the heck is wrong here?

Exhibit A: A dozen doctors at Fengcheng Hospital in northwest China's Shaanxi province took some group photos back in August. The photos somehow started circulating on the Internet a few days ago, and all hell broke loose.

Apparently, the photos show the doctors smiling and posing in front of an unconscious patient lying on the operating table. People were outraged, and the media picked up on that. Countless reports followed, criticizing the ""extremely unprofessional"" doctors. Within a few days, three officials of the hospital were removed from their posts and all the medical workers in the photos were given a demerit in their record.

So the media helped to bring the ""bad guys"" to justice. Isn't that wonderful? Or is it? What the media failed to report was that it was a very difficult surgery. The doctors operated for seven hours straight, without eating or drinking. They finally managed to keep the patient's left leg, and emotions were running high. And it just so happened that they would start working in a new operating room the next day, and this was the very last operation they did in this old one. They wanted to keep the memory. Thus, click click click. 

Granted, with the patient still lying unconscious on the operating table, taking such pictures was inappropriate, but there is a fine line between ""inappropriate"" and ""wrong"", and the doctors certainly did not deserve to be demonized. End of story.

By the way, how many times has the word ""selfies"" appeared in the media coverage? Do the Chinese media need a lesson on what constitutes a ""selfie""? The doctors in those group photos did not take the pictures themselves, so clearly, they were just group photos, not selfies. Let's not give people another reason to call the media ""ridiculous"", all right?

Exhibit B: Last week, it was widely reported that an eight-year-old HIV-positive boy in Xichong County, Sichuan province was banished by his fellow villagers. Locals insisted they signed the petition to exile Kunkun because he had been displaying destructive behavior, NOT because he was HIV positive. Kunkun's grandfather even blamed him for setting fire to their own home and stealing money.

And this week, pretty much everything changed. The latest narrative became: The villagers indeed signed a petition, but it was NOT intended to banish the poor boy. Instead, they were asking for better treatment and education for Kunkun, because it was simply not available in a relatively poor county like Xichong.

Then there's more. Turns out, the entire thing was the brainchild of two fake journalists. They wanted to raise awareness on the issue of helping HIV positive children, so they invented the original story, and later updated the story with some amazing twists and turns. 

Seriously? Seriously?? Has no one in the media heard of a concept called ""fact-check""?

Exhibit C: A foreigner who goes by the name of boogjohn小觉 on Sina Weibo became an instant celebrity this week. He went to a police station in Chongqing and asked for help in matters concerning a temporary residence permit. There was some back-and-forth conversation between him and the officer on duty. In the end, his problem was solved, and everything was hunky dory. Someone even captured the lovely scene on camera, how nice!

Except it wasn't nice at all. The picture ended up in a newspaper, with a completely false story to accompany it. In this story, the officer passed TEM-8 (Test for English Majors-Band 8) and thus was able to help the foreigner with his excellent English skills. But what really happened was, the foreigner asked for help in Chinese, and not one single English word came up. The back-and-forth was simply due to the foreigner trying to show the officer something on Baidu.

In a hilarious turn, boogjohn小觉 spotted himself in the newspaper and simply could not believe the BS story. He then took to his Weibo to set the record straight, and in the process left behind some colorful language that cracked almost everyone up, me included. 

This is by no means an endorsement of using foul language in a public venue, but come on, can you blame the guy? It's not like he wants every report to be a masterpiece, but at the very least, the media should never take it upon themselves to fabricate news stories. Facts only, no fiction allowed. Isn't that a given when it comes to news?

What's especially troubling is that all these examples happened within the same week. At this rate, no one can hide behind the so-called ""coincidence"" anymore. It's high time the Chinese media did some much-needed soul searching. Don't just be ashamed. Start changing. Right now.",Chinese media: time for some soul searching,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.476065862534129.1073741863.223495844457800/476065935867455/?type=3,2014-12-23 08:48:23,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0

Chinese President Xi Jinping has received the highest rating among world leaders, according to a survey published by Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation.

The survey with more than 26,000 respondents rated 10 world leaders, namely Xi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South African President Jacob Zuma.

Overall, Xi, Modi and Merkel are the top-performing leaders, with respective scores of 7.5, 7.3, and 7.2 on a scale of 1 to 10. Hollande (6.3), Abe (6.1), and Putin (6.0) are at the bottom.

In regards to the confidence citizens have in how their own leaders are handling domestic and international affairs, Xi tops the list in both categories at 94.8 percent and 93.8 percent respectively. Modi is the runner-up with 93.2 percent and 93.3 percent, while Putin comes in third with 86.2 percent and 86 percent.

With the exception of Japan, Xi is highly thought of in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. His foreign visits have apparently made a significant difference, as appreciation and awareness of Xi rose 10 percent in the countries he has visited.

On Nov. 25 last year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang published an article on major news media outlets of Central and Eastern European countries. Titled ""Greetings across Rivers and Mountains"", the article stressed the cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and CEE countries. In particular, Li Keqiang used Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic as an example. ""The world-famous Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic is an idol of young sports lovers in China and known affectionately as Xiao De among his Chinese fans.""

Now that the Chinese Premier is paying an official visit to Serbia, it's only natural that Djokovic's name will come up again. The current world number one indeed has a huge following in China, where tennis as a sports has grown tremendously in popularity the past few years. Among Djokovic's biggest achievements, he has managed to win five China Open titles out of five tries, a perfect record bound to be discussed by Chinese fans for years to come. He also won a bronze medal for Serbia in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, which holds a special place in his heart.

Thanks to his excellent performances in China, particularly in Beijing, Djokovic has on numerous occasions acknowledged that Beijing is his ""lucky city"" and China is his ""home outside of home"". In return, Chinese fans have showered Djokovic with love and admiration. They have even jokingly referred to China Open as Djokovic Open and called Djokovic ""the Chinese son"".

With a burning desire to get to know their idol better, many Chinese fans have started to pay more attention to Serbia. Earlier this year when Serbia was hit by the worst flooding since the country began keeping records 120 years ago, Chinese fans did not hesitate to offer a helping hand. They donated money and clothes, and called on family and friends to help as well. In addition, more Chinese tourists are visiting Serbia nowadays and contributing to the tourism revenues there.

223495844457800_472944496179599,"In an effort to strengthen economic and cultural links with central Asia and beyond, Chinese President Xi Jinping has put forward his concept for a New Silk Road Economic Belt. Some academics believe that concrete proposals like the Silk Road Economic Belt have linked China with these countries together in a community of shared destiny. One purpose of Premier Li Keqiang's current three-nation Eurasian trip is to transform the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, known shortly as the ""One Belt and One Road"" initiatives into reality. 

Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Serbia late Monday after wrapping up a visit to Kazakhstan in his Eurasian trip, which will also take him to Thailand. He was to participate in a leaders' meeting of China and Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries and make an official visit to Serbia, where he is expected to attend a ceremony marking the completion of a Chinese-built bridge across River Danube in Belgrade.

But Professor Ye Hailin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences urges observers to look at the importance of proposing such a concept rather than the concrete aspects of the project at such an early stage. ""This is a new type of doctrine for China to encourage cooperation with neighboring countries. We have seen that with the support of infrastructure building, China not only wants to build communication with the neighboring countries, it also wants to encourage its economic overseas presence by introducing some industrial complexes and trying to promote the Chinese companies' internationalization level, and also (by) trying to use Chinese FDI to make a balance between Chinese foreign trade and foreign investment. We know that most of the (neighboring) countries suffer a huge trade deficit in the bilateral relations with China. This is really difficult to change because China basically provides more industrialized products to the overseas market.""

Professor Shen Dingli, associate dean of International Studies at Fudan University has presented a broader view on the Silk Road Economy. He believes China needs to have a balanced economic development. So far China's southeast and east have caught up with the Asia Pacific economic development winds, so those areas participate more fully in that field of international cooperation and globalization and have boosted the Chinese economy. But that has also generated a problem: imbalanced domestic economic development. China needs to address this domestic imbalance by tapping its hinterland and also its remote bordering areas around Central Asian countries so as to fully develop their economic potential.  

Globally the European economic zone, the EU, has been integrating more members, now numbering 28, to lift the zone to a higher plateau. Central Asia and China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been situated between Asia Pacific economic ring and also European EU integration. So this middle belt, a vast territorial extension, has not fully achieved its own economic potential which makes the region imbalanced. Therefore, for neighboring countries' development, China needs to take a leadership role to initiate regional cooperation which would go beyond the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which attaches more importance to political and security dimensions. SCO needs to expand its economic scope. Professor Shen believes that this is an area with vast territory; not enough people; vast energy; and a great potential for agriculture, but no great industries except for those energy industries. People are not sufficiently linked due to the scarce population density and Central Asia's lack of funds required to build up their modern industries. So this is a feature of the region and a reality. And there is great potential for modern agriculture, modern connectivity through transport, modern telecommunications and modern finance. If these can be built up, each square kilometer can generate more wealth for Central Asian countries and for China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. China needs to show Central Asian countries the feasibility of the initiative and also shoulder the major financial responsibility because China will probably benefit greatly from building up such a modern Silk Road. 

Professor Shen Dingli is confident that China's ""One Belt and One Road"" initiatives will help boost development in China's western regions, which has been rich in territory, energy and lots of other minerals, but not rich in water and in populations living in the area. Therefore, China needs to link its own domestic development to this Central Asian neighborhood development. Now China is doing a lot through its ""Go West"" movement. The country is developing its own hinterland; its own southwest including Chengdu, Chongqing. Globally these places are being viewed as China's next economic hub. And China is preparing Xi'an as an aviation center, an education center and the departing point of a new Eurasian railway.

223495844457800_471472619660120,"Observers in China are dismissing concerns that marking Memorial Days will lead to a surge of ultra-nationalistic sentiment or fervent anti-Japanese behavior.

There was not much fanfare as China's top legislature approved a bill to mark the end of a war that brought much misery to China, and even less for the date marking the start of a six-week long rampage of slaughter, rape and looting in the country's war-time capital by Japanese troops.

But observers say the bill nonetheless carries weighty consideration as it shows the country's determination to remember its agonizing history.

Dr. Joseph Cheng is a historian at the Baptist University of Hong Kong.

""Marking these important events as a public holiday may well offer opportunities for people to commemorate the occasion, will allow people to discuss and think about the issues concerned. And at this stage it certainly would be a signal to the Japanese government that the Chinese people, the Chinese nation remembers and expects the Japanese people to do the same.""

Relations between Japan and its neighbors have been low in recent years.

Aside from escalating tension over territorial disputes with China and South Korea, the current Japanese cabinet also treaded on some facts associated with the Second World War.

There have been denials of the war-time sex slave issue, and school text books have been changed in an effort to reinforce Japan's territorial claims.

Cheng says observing remembrance days could actually ease tension between China and Japan.

""There is such a danger, but at the same time, even without designating the day as a public holiday, we do understand that provocative acts on the part of Japan may well cause adverse feelings and anger among Chinese people leading to protest activities."" 

Dr. Cheng reiterated that marking the two occasions engages the Chinese nation in self-reflection, and Japan as the perpetrators during the war have more reasons to do the same.

Professor Lam Kai Yin, a Sino-Japanese relation specialist at the City University of Hong Kong, while voicing a similar opinion, said as a legalized national policy the act does obligate the government to explain to the people what is expected of them.

""The Chinese government does have the obligation to explain to the Chinese people that the two memorial days are set for people to reflect on the human tragedy of war and its consequences, and reflect on why they should not have happened in the first place.""

On a very positive note, Prof. Lam said possibilities should not be excluded that the Japanese nation could be able to follow the example of the Germans and friendship with China be fully restored.

But no side can claim victory and the result is what can be expected by resorting to intentional violations of the local law and regulations, albeit with a touch of the civil disobedience spirit. 

The clearance followed injunction orders issued by the High Court of Hong Kong. Monitored by members of the police watchdog and more than 200 local and international journalists, the seven-hour police operation proceeded without any clashes between officers and protesters, unlike in the clearance operation in Mong Kok. The police ended the main sit-in of the Occupy movement in Admiralty Thursday with the arrest of 247 people, including politicians, student leaders and a pop star.  Dramatically, more than 100 protesters had started a sit-in on the road, waiting to be arrested including such local household names as Democratic Party founding chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming, Apple Daily boss Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, Canto-pop singer Denise Ho Wan-see, Federation of Students secretary general Alex Chow Yong-kang and nine members of the federation.

Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung had ordered police to continue using minimal force in the clearance of both the Admiralty and Causeway Bay Occupy camps and appealed to his fellow lawmakers to put aside their differences to support Hong Kong's long-term interests. But students vowed to fight on, predicting a 'second wave of occupation' in other ways after Christmas.

223495844457800_471084793032236,"With the announcement that five health care workers will share Time Magazine's 2014 Person of the Year award, the fight against Ebola in West Africa has once again captured the headlines of mainstream media in the world. The role played by major countries including the United States and China has also become a hot topic bringing about both compliments and complaints. But at this critical time of crisis, it is more constructive to make proposals for improvement instead of pointing fingers.

The latest figure from the World Health Organization indicates that the death toll from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has risen to 6,331 in the three worst hit countries. In Sierra Leone only, between 80 and 100 new cases of Ebola are being reported every day and the country desperately needs more than 1,000 beds to treat victims. Washington has led the international drive to stop the spread of the disease, sending thousands of troops and making donation commitments. The White House is now asking Congress for $6.18 billion in additional funding to fight Ebola, which includes calls for more than $4.5 billion for the immediate response to the disease and $1.5 billion for a contingency fund to make resources available if necessary. Earlier in late October, the White House responded to criticism that as the global superpower it was not doing enough by taking a veiled swipe at the contributions of Russia and China. Indeed, the United States' Ebola commitment has dwarfed Beijing's 750 million yuan ($123 million) in aid. Some critics have rounded on Beijing for being ""mercantilistic "" and not helping more in Africa's hour of need. There are even suggestions that the local African roads and infrastructure China has helped build may have hastened the Ebola crisis by bringing infected animals into closer contact with humans. 

But mere criticism will not help ease the crisis. In fact, China has promised that its assistance will not stop until the Ebola epidemic is eradicated in West Africa. Since August, China has made four rounds of emergency funding to the international effort against the Ebola virus epidemic, and dispatched hundreds of aid workers to Africa to combat Ebola including health experts and medical staff. China has announced that a medical squad of the People's Liberation Army, which has experience from a 2002 outbreak of SARS, will build a 100-bed treatment center in Liberia and 480 PLA medical staff will be deployed to treat Ebola patients. It's the first time China has deployed a whole unit of epidemic prevention forces and military medical staff abroad. In addition, some Chinese companies in West Africa have also joined the relief efforts. 

China is Africa's biggest trade partner. In fact, more than half of China's foreign aid of over $14 billion went to Africa. China was dispatching more health personnel as aid groups from the United States, Europe, and Japan were evacuating their own. The U.S. military isn't the only institution capable of building emergency response centers and staffing them. There are suggestions that China can use its huge transport and communication capabilities in Africa to distribute supplies and public messaging, especially given its large number of construction firms in the region. U.S. and Chinese troops staged their first disaster relief exercise in November 2013 in a signal that China is increasingly eager to use its growing military muscle for humanitarian causes. 

Domestically since the Ebola virus is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, quarantine measures — widely used in China's fight against avian flu — can help break the chain of infection. Given that early symptoms of Ebola infection are similar to those of H7N9, China's experience in handling these cases can be useful to Ebola treatment. Despite their lack of experience in handling Ebola cases, Chinese doctors have reportedly identified the Ebola virus antibody gene, along with diagnostic reagents for the virus. And by the end of August, China surprised the world by announcing that it had successfully developed its first drug for treating Ebola. But China has not completed the building of a maximum containment laboratory known as a BSL-4 facility to handle highly dangerous pathogens such as the Ebola viruses. Given the lack of basic research on the virus, it is highly doubtful that China's first Ebola drug can be effective — so far, it has only been allowed for use in ""emergency situations.""  Even the United States — which owns at least 7 BSL-4 labs and has spent the past three decades researching the virus — is still in the experimental stages of developing vaccines and post-exposure treatment for Ebola.

So while the Chinese role in helping African countries fight Ebola should not be downplayed, there will be a limit on how much China can contribute to the ongoing humanitarian efforts in Africa.",How much more can China contribute to fighting Ebola,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.471084769698905.1073741855.223495844457800/471084793032236/?type=3,2014-12-11 04:37:26,0,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0

223495844457800_470674056406643,"The new air purifier announced by Chinese electronics company Xiaomi Inc. is a coup designed to steal the limelight from international manufacturers of similar products. The Mi Air Purifier is equipped with real time air quality monitor and its tiny tower takes up only about A4 paper size space on the floor. But most importantly, the machine has a price tag of just 899 yuan ($145), much cheaper than smart air purifiers made by others. 

Air purifiers are gradually becoming a must-have home appliance in Beijing and elsewhere in many parts of China, where smog levels have stayed at hazardous levels from time to time. At this price/performance ratio, consumers really have little to complain about. 

Often described as ""China's Apple"", Xiaomi is now the third-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world behind Samsung and Apple. In selling the Xiaomi smartphone, Xiaomi employs a strategy that prices the phone almost at bill-of-material prices. To profit from the narrow margin, Xiaomi sells a model for up to 18 months instead of the short 6 months used by other manufacturers to profit from the fall in the costs of components that occurs over time. Other than that, Xiaomi is also known as borrowing design from other companies, and offering a competitively-priced product with decent quality. But air purifier is not as high-tech a product as a smartphone. So such a business model does not seem to apply here. Can it deliver this time?

223495844457800_470231179784264,"The conventional wisdom is that we should not overemphasize the significance that the benchmark Shanghai index regained the 3,000-point psychological mark on Monday, the first time since April 25, 2011. But from a symbolic standpoint, it's still a major indicator for the Chinese economic outlook in the long run.  

The public interest in China's stock market has been growing steadily with the rapid rise in stock indices. For punters and stock enthusiasts, to say that Chinese stocks are on a tear would be an understatement. The post-June rally gathered steam after breaking key down trendlines in July and October. More recently, the up-move accelerated further following the opening of the Shanghai stock market to foreign investment. The rally was also supported by interest rate cut, which increased liquidity. Since the Chinese central bank cut interest rates on Nov. 21, the Shanghai index has surprised the market with a 17 percent jump. Many institutions expect a cut in the reserve requirement ratio soon for some banks, which is expected to release more funds into the equity market. Many analysts view the rally as the beginning of a bullish cycle. The Composite has shown its largest 6-day, 6-week and 6-month gains in roughly 5 years. Some experts good at stock market technical analysis have explained that when a market breaks out of a low-volatility compression like the Shanghai Composite has recently, it typically moves to a high-volatility extreme, eventually, despite profit taking to take advantage of a sharp rise in the stock price.

But as always for stock market analysis, there is an equally convincing bearish argument that the recent stock gains are the result of irrational buying, amplified by borrowed money and don't reflect the nation's economic fundamentals. Skeptics have predicted that if the central bank shifted course in easing, China's stock market rally would fizzle away very quickly.

Actually it's not that important to ask whether the rally has run its course or there could be more to this move, especially for long-term investors. What's important is that the Chinese stock market has become gradually normal and attractive to ordinary investors. For quite a long time, most of China's private equity buyers have lost interest in the stock market, because the performance of stock market seemed to have nothing to do with the country's general economic conditions. To some extent, the Chinese stock market was more an arena for companies to raise cash and a gambling house than one for investment. 

But the abnormal performance of stocks could be a reflection on China's general economic state. Since 1978, China has seen the most rapid economic growth of any country in world history, and the most rapid growth of living standards of any major economy. China is now the world's fastest-growing major economy, with growth rates averaging 10 percent over the past 30 years. American business magnate Bill Gates recently made a mind-blowing comparison in his blog that between 2011 and 2013, China consumed 6.6 gigatons of concrete – that's more than the U.S. used in the entire 20th century. Common sense tells us that this unprecedented and phenomenal growth cannot possibly grow forever. Some economists now talk more about the nature of China's economic slowdown, believing that the country is having a soft landing with the potential to maintain an average economic growth of above 7 percent a year for another decade. 

In a word, China's economic growth has at last become normalized and the current stock market may just be a reflection of the positive view on China. Apparently the outlook is more optimistic for investors with a longer-term horizon. Chinese premier Li Keqiang has promised to focus on boosting reform and making structural adjustment to ensure that the market will play a strong role. This principle applies to stock market as well. In the future, the hand of government will surely become less and less visible with market forces determining the rise and fall of stocks.  

The stock market is the barometer of economic development. Historically it has been proven true with the wisdom of hindsight. There should be no exception to the rule for China's stock market.",The importance of China's stock market becoming normal,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.470231156450933.1073741852.223495844457800/470231179784264/?type=3,2014-12-09 02:56:28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In fact, as early as in 2012, 90 percent of the atoll's population already depended on rain water, often collected in household water tanks as a principal source of water. However, the rain water storage is limited with an average household storage capacity of 2500 liters on most islands. It is simply amazing they hadn't had a crisis earlier, as the reduced rainfall during the dry season (January-June) leaves several islands across Maldives in a severe annual water crisis. The problem has been compounded by changing weather patterns and prolonged dry periods. 

China is on good terms with the Indian Ocean archipelago. Maldives is among the hottest destinations for Chinese tourists. Chinese President Xi Jinping made a state visit to Maldives in September, the first of its kind since the two sides established diplomatic ties 42 years ago. The two countries reached an agreement on the development of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. In response to an appeal from the Maldives for aid from India, Sri Lanka, the United States and China, the Chinese government is shipping about 1,000 tons fresh water to the water-starved country via plane and vessel and has arranged for all commercial flights out of China to the Maldives capital of Male to be loaded with drinking water. In addition, a Chinese navy ship with water purification facilities is on its way to Male. At the same time, the Chinese government has donated 500,000 U.S. dollars to the Maldives government to speed up repairs in a desalination plant and restore water to the capital. Earlier Maldives announced that an estimated 20 million U.S. dollars would be needed to repair the plant that was damaged in a fire last week resulting in the capital's population of 130,000 being without water. India is also sending five planes with water and two ships with parts that can help fix the machinery at the plant.

Efforts are being made to provide sustainable solutions to the annual water crisis inclduign several internationally funded projects initiated over the past years. The Maldives Ministry of Housing and Environment and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) signed a US$8.5 million project in 2011 to provide ""climate smart freshwater solutions"" to three densely populated islands; Ihavandho in Haa Alif atoll, Mahibadhoo in Alif Dhaalu atoll and Gadhdhoo in Gaafu Dhaalu. The United States government also provided US$7.1 million towards an integrated water resource system on Lhaviyani Hinnavaru and Haa alif Dhihdhoo islands, under an agreement signed in 2011 between the two governments.

The China Consumers' Association has warned that A-locks, which constitute over 50 percent of all locks used on the mainland, are extremely susceptible to break-ins.

An A-lock refers to locks where the keyhole resembles the English letter ""I"" or an ""X."" These locks generally lack internal pins or a mechanism with grooves inside that would make them harder to unlock without a key.

With today's lock-picking tools and training, anyone can overcome an A-lock in just a couple of seconds, according to the association.

B-locks, on the other hand, are more complex in design, with the groove and pin mechanisms that make it harder to unlock via lock-picking. The time it takes to open a B-lock without a key is about 30 minutes, according to the China Consumer's Association.

Residents and business owners using A-locks are urged to switch to B-locks or other high-security locks immediately.

People can improve their lock's security by just changing the cylinder, rather than the whole lock itself. A B-lock cylinder costs between 200 and 300 yuan ($US32.50 to $US49).

     The fiasco of the ruling KMT party in Taiwan's district elections is seen by many as a ""No"" signal from the people of the island to Ma Ying-jeou's government's current conciliatory policy toward the mainland. If that's the case, will the victory of the opposing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) damage peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait?

    The defeat suffered by the KMT reveals Taiwanese discontent toward the unsatisfactory status quo on the island — the growing gap between rich and poor, stagnation in wages and the lack of employment opportunities for young people. The unexpected recent food security scandals also worked against the ruling party's candidates.

    The media tend to depict Ma as friendly to the mainland and simplify his policy as pro-mainland. But that's far from accurate.

    It's true that Ma advocates peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait because he understands that Taiwan wouldn't be able to bear strains in its relations with Beijing.

    A services trade pact between Taiwan and the mainland, pending ratification, is controversial, as reflected by protests and the occupation of government buildings in March.

    But Ma's government acts solely for the interests of Taiwan.

    Since 2008, when Ma was first elected as the island's leader, Taiwan has strengthened trade ties with the mainland. The two sides signed multiple trade deals, including the landmark Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in 2010. Partly boosted by tariff reductions under the ECFA, Taiwan now exports 25 percent of its products to the mainland.

    In addition to a services trade pact waiting to be approved by Taiwan's legislature, Taiwan and the mainland are also negotiating an agreement on goods trade. All of these are designed to lift Taiwan's economy out of a state of slow growth.

    Can the DPP do a better job in improving people's livelihoods? Hardly, unless they take practical steps to keep the sound relationship with the mainland on track.

    For the existing deals, the DPP will find it impossible to roll them back since they are designed to benefit Taiwan more than the mainland.

    There are even more imminent challenges for Taiwan when the mainland and South Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA) takes effect next year.

    According to Taiwan's official figures, about 80 percent of their exports to the mainland market are competing with those from South Korea. An FTA between Seoul and Beijing will put Taiwan at a great disadvantage. It would be wise for Taiwan, whether under the KMT or the DPP, to forge a close relationship with the mainland in order to maintain its competitive edge.

    The Chinese mainland is reshaping the financial landscape of Asia with a series of new business initiatives, such as Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, FTA in Asia and the Pacific, the Silk Road Economic Belt, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, etc. Taiwan needs to leap on these historic changes to avoid marginalization; it should seize upon the opportunity to inject fresh vitality into its ailing economy.

    Politically, Asian countries will frown upon any DPP moves that threaten to destroy stability in the region. Similarly, even the U.S. would not be amused if the DPP dares to rock the boat.

    With the DPP's landslide victory, Beijing will have to deal with the pro-independence party whether they like it or not, but that doesn't mean a total regression of the harmony across the strait unless the DPP plans to perpetuate economic stagnation and isolate Taiwan's economy.

In 1980, Chen Jungui was dispatched with a team of soldiers to build roads in the Tianshan Mountains. The team was snowed in by a blizzard. As their food ran out, team leader Zheng Linshu sent them in different directions to find help. All died except for Chen.

For nearly 30 years, Chen, 55, has stayed with the tombs of his team members. Chen credited his survival to the team's last small bun, given him by team leader Zheng.

After recovering from the ordeal, Chen left his hometown in Liaoning province in 1985 and returned to the valleys in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region with his wife, Sun Liqin, and newborn son. They had decided to watch over the tombs of his fellow soldiers.

Over the past decades, Chen and his wife have been the first to arrive at the tombs each day, cleaning them and paying tribute to the dead, who he believes should be remembered for their sacrifice. He sought out the families of each team member, but when he learned the whereabouts of Zheng's parents, he only found their graves in Hubei province. At their gravesite, he vowed he would stay with Zheng's tomb for the rest of his life so as ""not to leave Zheng lonely"".",Photos from China Plus News's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/chinaplusnews/photos/a.237106616430056.1073741831.223495844457800/444057925734923/?type=3,2014-10-03 10:04:11,16,2,3,16,0,0,0,0,0

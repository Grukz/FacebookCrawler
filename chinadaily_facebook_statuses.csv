If the very affluent town of Greenwich, Connecticut - about 35 miles from New York City - were in China, would it bring Western-educated Chinese expats back to the mainland? 

That's apparently what Wang Chuxiang, chairman of Zhejiang Jiangong Real Estate Development Group Co, is hoping will happen as he plans to emulate aspects of the town in a model city he is creating in his native Hangzhou, a capital city of nearly 9 million in Zhejiang province. 

Hangzhou was selected because it is a nearly two-hour drive from the financial center of Shanghai. The 6 billion yuan ($966.4 million) development is scheduled to be completed in 2019. Chinese banks, corporate investment and private investors are financing the project.

A report on the office's website said the audit－carried out in November and December－covered 18 provinces and 228 lottery sale institutions nationwide, as well as 4,956 lottery projects involving public welfare funds.

Auditors found the funds were misused through the purchase and establishment of office buildings, or had been embezzled. Some officials in lottery shops also benefitted illegally from the funds through fake lottery projects, the report said.

In an op-ed carried by The Wall Street Journal, Wang said the key China-US dialogue has helped the two countries effectively manage differences and minimize their impact on bilateral relations, and also helped US leaders and the public learn more about 21st-century China.

The dialogue is a sign of the growing maturity of China-US relations, Wang said, noting that bilateral trade has doubled over the past nine years and China has become one of the fastest-growing export markets for the United States.

Over the past six years, direct investment from Chinese companies to the United States has increased fivefold, creating more than 80,000 jobs across the country, he said, adding that there's significant room for growth if there are fewer obstacles to Chinese investment in the United States.

Government spending on medical aid rose by an annual average of 13.8 percent during the period, said Jiang Yu with the Ministry of Finance.

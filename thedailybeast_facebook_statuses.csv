Ironically, the scary creatures have been helping the environment for years by eating a large number of flying insects and helping pollinate crops. And considering many bat carcassses are taken by animals before researchers can find them, the numbers are probably conservative, biologist Mark Hayes noted. Even worse, it's unlikely the species will repopulate quickly, considering bats give birth just one time every year. http://thebea.st/HRTFlf",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/thedailybeast/photos/a.477639884202.290822.37763684202/10152081859174203/?type=3,2013-11-16 10:37:29,90,65,63,90,0,0,0,0,0

When he left the Marines, it was to pursue his own dreams and become a teacher. But the call to military service stayed with him. In 2001 Landsberry reenlisted into the Nevada Air National Guard and went on to deploy three times, most recently to Afghanistan. For all three tours, Landsberry was a volunteer.

On Monday, Landsberry was back in Sparks, Nevada, when he heard shots fired just outside the classroom where he was giving his math lesson. That was when ""instinct kicked in,"" said Chief Master Sergeant James Ross, a friend and fellow airman from the 152nd Airlift Wing. Acting on that instinct, Landsberry told the students in his class to run away and get someplace safe. By that time, one student had already been shot in the shoulder. Then Landsberry went outside and took his final steps, walking toward the sound of gunfire and the shooter.

Jolie's mother died of breast cancer at age 56, and the actress writes that her children had ""asked if the same thing could happen to me."" She carries a ""faulty"" gene, or BRCA1, which means she not only had an 87 percent risk of developing breast cancer, but also has a 50 percent chance of getting ovarian cancer. ""Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and minimize the risk as much as I could,"" Jolie writes. On April 27 she had the last medical procedure as part of the mastectomies-and her chance of developing breast cancer dropped to under 5 percent.

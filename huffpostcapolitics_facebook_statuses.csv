""Between 2005 and 2008 before the visa was put in place, Mexicans made up 25% of all refugee claims filed in Canada, which is a staggering number. In addition, the ongoing reports of increasing levels of state violence and corruption do not inspire confidence in the integrity of their passport controls.
 
""Trudeau has disregarded expert analysis and evidence, and taken a political decision that puts the security of Canadians at risk. If security isn't a concern, then why do most countries  - including and especially the United States -  require a visa for Mexican Nationals?
 
""The decision to lift the visa appears to be a completely political quid pro quo, rather than a decision based on evidence and Canada's national interests.  Conservatives call on the Liberal Government to make its visa decisions based on evidence and follow the formal process.""

582847005062947_1311498528864454,"Interim Conservative Leader Hon. Rona Ambrose has released the following statement welcoming Canada's formal apology for the Komagata Maru incident, to be delivered Wednesday by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau:

""While Canada is renowned for being warm and welcoming toward new Canadians, unfortunately, our past record isn't perfect.  This is evident through the detention and turning away of the Komagata Maru in 1914.  It was an event that caused terrible hardship for its passengers. When the vessel arrived in Vancouver on May 23, 1914, most of the nearly 400 passengers aboard were immigrants from Punjab. They were Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims, and all British subjects, just like Canadians at the time. For many, it was an event that ended in tragedy.

""Today is a historic day for Canadians, as we recognize the Komagata Maru incident in the House of Commons with an apology. It is important that Canada acknowledges our wrongdoings of the past, as we have always stood up for social injustices at home and abroad.

""Leading up to this important day, the previous Conservative Government took a number of steps to address the terrible tragedy of the Komagata Maru.  In 2008, the Government of Canada first officially recognized this tragedy when Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized for the Komagata Maru incident in Vancouver. In addition, the Government created the Community Historical Recognition Program (CHRP), through which it was announced the Indo-Canadian community would be able to apply for over $2 million in grants for projects that acknowledge, commemorate, and educate current and future Canadians about Komagata Maru.

""The previous Conservative Government also funded the first ever public museum dedicated to the tragedy housed at the Khalsa Diwan Society in Vancouver, as well as the first ever public monument in Vancouver's Harbour Green Park.  And on the 100th anniversary in 2014, Canada Post released a special stamp to further create awareness.

""Today, over one million Canadians are of South Asian descent.  These hard-working men and women are passionately devoted to their families and communities, and are helping make our country even stronger.

""Conservatives continue to recognize and appreciate the significant and important contributions of South Asian Canadians.  We cannot change the events of the past, but we can continue to recognize the passion and hard work of this community as we all work toward a better future for Canada.""

""Everyone deserves to live free of stigma, persecution, and discrimination – no matter who they are or whom they love. Today is about ensuring that all people – regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity – feel safe and secure, and empowered to freely express themselves.

""On this important day, I encourage all Canadians to raise awareness, and mobilize to end the violence, prejudice, and judgement faced by LGBTQ2 persons.

""As a society, we have taken many important steps toward recognizing and protecting the legal rights for the LGBTQ2 community – from enshrining equality rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the passage of the Civil Marriage Act. There remains much to be done, though. Far too many people still face harassment, discrimination, and violence for being who they are. This is unacceptable.

""To do its part, the Government of Canada today will introduce legislation that will help ensure transgender and other gender-diverse people can live according to their gender identity, free from discrimination, and protected from hate propaganda and hate crimes.

""Today, let us unite in a global celebration of diversity, and reaffirm our commitment to unequivocally defend LGBTQ2 rights as human rights. We will never stop fighting for a safer, more equal, and more just world for all of our children.""

""Many supporters of other political parties are seeing that the values and policies they hold dearest – on the environment, healthcare, social services, foreign policy and trade – are in the DNA of the Green Party of Canada.""

""While other parties pursue their pipedreams on pipelines, the Green Party embraces a 21st century economy fueled by renewable energy, one that will bring high-paying, secure jobs to all corners of our great country,"" Ms. May said. ""We welcome Jean Rousseau in the fight for a better Canada.""

""It is with enthusiasm and great pleasure that I join Ms. May's growing team at the Green Party of Canada. The decision to become a member of the party and contribute to making our country more environmentally conscious is, for me, an important source of motivation as a staunch environmentalist, Mr. Rousseau said.

""Jean brings to the Green party some real political experience. As a fellow québécois, I look forward to working with Jean on issues in Québec that will help the party to grow in the province,"" said Daniel Green deputy leader of the Green Party of Canada.

So it was asking aboriginal people across the country to open up wounds and tell their stories about abuse and residential schools and so on, while at the same time cutting the national healing programs. It didn't make any sense."" - Dr. Rod McCormick

We recognize the importance of the grassroots voices that are speaking up. We want to assure all Canadians we remain focused on the work that needs to continue in support of the community. The voices of the people of Attawapiskat are being heard. We will be visiting the community on Monday to meet with community members and youth leaders and determine with them how to address their immediate needs and chart a path forward.

Officials have  been working with the First Nation, Nishnawbe Aski Nation and provincial colleagues to provide mental health and community supports to Attawapiskat and the individuals and families in need. We are also working together on longer term solutions to improve the quality of life for members of the community.

Federal and provincial partners and the First Nation all have dedicated people working on a priority basis on these issues.

It is vital to our nation's future that we work in genuine partnership to ensure better social and economic outcomes for Indigenous Peoples, especially youth.""

One of his organizers, Bram Sepers, told HuffPost, they were putting in place the conditions necessary for a successful run.

""Michael will be a strong conservative voice for a new generation of conservatives,"" Sepers said. 

Chong was an intergovernmental affairs minister briefly in Stephen Harper's cabinet but he resigned unexpectedly in 2006 over a motion to recognize the Québécois as a nation. Chong said he didn't believe in ethnic nationalism and cut his ministerial career short. 

Since then, the 44-year-old is better known for championing the Reform Act, a bill that sought to empower members of Parliament.

So far, only two contestants — Quebec MP and former foreign affairs cabinet minister Maxime Bernier, and Ontario MP and former labour minister Dr. Kellie Leitch — have officially joined the leadership race.

Conservatives pick their new leader on May 27, 2017.

We have heard the concerns of those who have gone through additional security screening that this situation can cause confusion and feelings of stigmatization.

Public Safety Canada officials have now contacted air carriers to clarify the application of the existing Secure Air Travel Regulations, emphasizing to them that additional security screening validation is not required for individuals under the age of 18.

My department is also exploring possible regulatory amendments to the Secure Air Travel Regulations that would help differentiate individuals who have similar or the same names as individuals listed under the Passenger Protect Program. 

Further to this, the government is committed to public consultations to ensure that our overall national security framework and procedures are effective in keeping Canadians safe, while also safeguarding our values in a free and democratic society.

The job involves composing poetry for use in Parliament on occasions of state, and promoting the written word by sponsoring readings and advising the Parliamentary Librarian on the Library's cultural collection. 

""The appointment is a personal holiday gift, but it is a transcendent, national recognition of the vitality of our official languages and doubly powerful poetries, informed by two great literary traditions,"" Clarke said in a statement. ""I'm humbled and honoured, inspired and eager, to follow previous Parliamentary
Poets Laureate in valuing in verse our super-natural nation's exemplary experiments in democratized humanism.""

582847005062947_1214917755189199,"Conservative foreign affairs critic Tony Clement and international human rights and religious freedom critic David Anderson released the following statement Monday on the situation in Saudi Arabia.

""Canada's relationship with Saudi Arabia is strategically important, for our security and for the security of the region. As well, Iran's support for terrorism and its fomenting of tensions across the Middle East including in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Bahrain are threats to peace and stability in the region. However, the execution of Nimr al-Nimr in particular hurts Saudi and regional security by unnecessarily further inflaming Sunni/Shia tensions, where sectarianism remains one of the greatest challenges facing the region.

We share Saudi concerns about Iran's efforts to export their violent ideology in the region, but alienating moderate Shias in the midst of these tensions is deeply counter-productive.

""The Conservative caucus calls on the government of Saudi Arabia to seek improved relations and dialogue with the moderate Shia community, both in and outside their country. We call on the Canadian government to raise these issues with the Saudi government at the first opportunity.""

""Yesterday during Question Period, Minister Maryam Monsef said consulting Canadians in a referendum on electoral reform would prejudice the Liberal consultation process.""
 
We can't think of a more robust, inclusive consultation process than the holding of a referendum. The Liberal government obviously thinks Canadians can't be trusted with such a fundamental change to our democracy. We couldn't disagree more.""
 
Not since the 1950s has a Canadian government tried to alter their electoral system without consulting their people in a referendum. Liberal party governments in British Columbia (2005 and 2009), Prince Edward Island (2005), and Ontario (2007) put their proposed reforms to a referendum. In peer countries New Zealand (1992, 1993, and 2011) and the United Kingdom (2011), the people were similarly consulted by way of referenda. Modern democratic history overwhelmingly supports the use of referenda when changes to an electoral system are proposed.
 
The Liberal government does not have a mandate to implement whatever new system they decide suits the Liberal party best. Neither the Liberal platform, nor the Liberal government, has proposed an alternative method of electing Members of Parliament; all they have proposed is that the system should change.""
 
We're glad the Minister admitted that Canadians ""...deserve to be consulted..."", however, her refusal to give Canadians a vote on the unreleased Liberal plan for electoral reform is stubbornly and profoundly undemocratic.""
 
Canadians deserve to see the Liberal proposal, fully formed, and to then have the opportunity to vote to adopt or reject that proposal in a referendum.""",Democratic Institutions Minister Grilled On Electoral Reform,video,https://www.facebook.com/huffpostcapolitics/videos/1198663716814603/,2015-12-09 11:03:16,777,127,639,777,0,0,0,0,0

582847005062947_1190940264253615,"Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel released the following statement on the Liberals' refugee resettlement plan:

""Canada is an open and generous country. Canada should continue to take an active role in assisting with the humanitarian crisis in the region.
 
Refugees arriving in Canada should be welcomed with open arms and the full confidence of all Canadians. Mr. Trudeau's campaign promise to resettle 25,000 refugees by December 31 did not include a comprehensive plan for safety, security, housing, health and integration into the Canadian family.
 
We are pleased that Mr. Trudeau has today listened to Canadians and abandoned a timeline that was not workable. Any resettlement plan must allow for the full integration of refugees as welcomed members of Canadian society.
 
Last January our Conservative Government announced a commitment to resettle an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees. Pursuant to that commitment, approximately 10,000 refugees had either been processed or were in the final stages of processing. That work gives the current government a tremendous head start in aiding Syrian refugees.

Today's announcement by the Liberals still leaves Canadians with many unanswered questions about plans for caring for refugees upon arrival, and specifically, the real costs of the plan, impacts on provincial governments, and the involvement of our Canadian Armed Forces.
 
We believe it is also imperative that Canada stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the mission to degrade ISIS. We continue to call on the Liberal government to reverse its position and ensure the Royal Canadian Air Force remains engaged in the fight against ISIS.""

Sona apparently wrote this last night:

""Although I am now in prison, through my friend, I'd like to re-state
to the media what I said in my first statement on February 28th 2014, which is that I had no involvement in the fraudulent phone calls. Since the story first broke - and unlike my accusers who have changed their stories based on media reports - I've never changed my story once.  Furthermore, although I have  suspicions based on media reports I've read as other Canadians do, I have no person knowledge who on the Marty Burke campaign was responsible for these fraudulent phone calls.

To those who claim I am lying, that I was somehow involved, that I boasted about my involvement to distant acquaintances I barely knew, and that I am am continuing to lie to protect the Conservative Party by refusing to name names I say the following: No ninety thousand dollar cheque and no ninety million dollar cheque ever can compensate for the loss of my personal reputation and for what my family has suffered because of this ordeal.

I'd like to conclude my statement by again reiterating what my lawyer has previously stated: 'I cannot help but comment, that if the government was interested in the public being fully informed and the issue of robocalls being properly addressed, a Full Public Inquiry would be called, rather than a charge laid against a single individual who held a junior position on a single campaign and who clearly lacked the resources and access to the data required to make the robocalls.' I am confident the public agrees.""

STATEMENT BY MP MURRAY

OTTAWA – Member of Parliament and Liberal leadership candidate Joyce Murray released the following statement after the results of the Liberal leadership race:
 
""When the Liberal Party decided to open the doors wide and invite Canadians in to take part in this historic Leadership selection process, it heralded a new way of doing politics in Canada. Some considered it risky, but by inviting like-minded, yet diverse voices to register support for specific policies and visions for this country, our Party has for the first time in several decades engaged in a great big, healthy discussion of real issues and directions for our Party and our country.
 
Canadians heard our call, and answered in historic numbers. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians gave input that we heard together, already forging consensus on some of the questions large and small facing Canadian society – and our Party. Not just on the legalization, regulation and taxation of cannabis, on skills training and education and on open nominations, but on putting a price on carbon and developing a sustainable economy – if I might venture – a Sustainable Society – and on the urgent and pressing need for electoral and other meaningful democratic reforms. Democratic reforms that Canadians, without doubt, crave. Reforms that will make our democracy and our Parliament more collaborative and respectful. 

""I am proud and honoured by the strength, commitment and conviction of support I attracted by my message and vision for Canada. I thank my supporters, my team and my family for helping me to make this contribution and encouraging me to make your case to our Party and to Canadians. 

""Justin, as our new Leader, as my colleague in Parliament and on the hustings, has shown that the strength of Liberalism lies in the values and experiences we share. I congratulate and salute him. I look forward to working with Justin and all our fellow leadership colleagues as part of a united Liberal team that offers Canadians a compelling vision – a Liberal vision – for Canada.",,status,,2013-04-14 19:15:31,18,1,3,18,0,0,0,0,0

582847005062947_632052756809038,"STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA ON THE DEATH OF FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER
 
Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued the following statement today on the death of former British Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Margaret Thatcher:

""With the passing of Baroness Thatcher, the world has lost a giant among leaders.
 
""While many in positions of power are defined by the times in which they govern, Margaret Thatcher had that rarest of abilities to herself personify and define the age in which she served. Indeed, with the success of her economic policies, she defined contemporary conservatism itself.
 
""Her greatest achievements however, were surely on the world stage. Along with the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan, and His Holiness Pope John Paul II, she played a key role in the fall of the USSR. The era of peace and prosperity that followed the end of the Cold War must therefore rank as one of her great and lasting gifts to this generation.
Lady Thatcher's leadership in time of conflict and during the generous peace she helped bring forth, was an example to the world. As a result, millions now live with the dignity and freedom that she envisioned for them, during the darkest moments of the post-war years.
 
""She well deserved to be known as 'The Iron Lady'.
 
""Canadians knew Mrs. Thatcher well: she addressed Canada's Parliament twice.
 
""I recall with pride her eloquent portrayal of the philosophical groundings of the principles that have - and I hope forever will - unite the British and Canadian peoples.
 
""'The ideals which our two countries share are the answer to all the doubters,"" she said. 'For centuries we have striven first to win, then to preserve, that freedom and justice without which life has neither dignity nor meaning.'
 
""New to my own duties as Prime Minister in 2006, she provided me wise and gracious counsel in London, the memory of which I will forever cherish.
 
""Laureen and I join all Canadians in saluting the proud life and legacy of Lady Thatcher.""",,status,,2013-04-08 09:13:30,5,5,6,5,0,0,0,0,0

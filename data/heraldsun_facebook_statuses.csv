We met Marcus at the corner of Flinders Ln and Degraves St.

""I was a finance broker selling home loans and getting them approved for a bank. I developed schizophrenia and started hearing voices. I've not heard a voice for 10 years but I became homeless in that time and was living in a garage. It was pretty hard without a bathroom, a kitchen and a toilet and it was cold. Trying to keep doctor's appointments and things like that while I'm homeless, it was just very hard to do. Even things like keeping your phone recharged became impossible. It made me value paying rent and making sure you've got a safe roof over your head. The best thing in my life was finally getting a home a month after being homeless and keeping it. Being a finance broker was very stressful, about 60 hours a week. Good income, but I believe I would've had an early heart attack if I kept going. I prefer doing the Big Issue to be honest.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/heraldsun/photos/a.417370303170.194381.91269123170/10153317321693171/?type=3,2015-09-08 20:00:00,85,7,2,85,0,0,0,0,0

We met Jafri Katagar in the middle of the Flinders St and Swanston St intersection. 

""Last year I was racially abused by a doctor. She said that I'm black and I don't understand. I felt really bad. I even wanted to go back to Africa.  I said, 'this is my new home, I don't want to be treated like this in the place I call my home, Australia'.
That's why I come here two or three times a week doing this anti-racism campaign. I'm originally from Uganda but I'm an Australian citizen. Australians are nice, loving and generous but we still have a racism problem. Most of the responses are good and there's a few negatives. There was a lady who told me two weeks ago, 'you're taking our jobs and putting up house prices', and some men who called me nigger from the car. These are the negative ones but the positive people tell me to keep doing this. Even though it doesn't make a difference, I'd rather be run over by a car here than die from racism. A few weeks ago somebody told me to go back by boat, but I didn't come by boat.I came by Qantas.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/heraldsun/photos/a.417370303170.194381.91269123170/10153271149213171/?type=3,2015-08-19 00:27:20,175,79,13,175,0,0,0,0,0

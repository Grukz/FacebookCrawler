""If I were young again-and I wish I could go back- I would spend my life as a teacher of young children, doing all in my power to give them a vision of the dignity and glory of being builders and planters, makers and menders,"" she wrote in her autobiography.

McClung dedicated her life to fighting for human rights and is most famous for her work with Canada's women's suffrage movement. In 1914, she held a mock Parliament in Manitoba to lampoon arguments against giving women the right to vote by presenting a satiric case for male suffrage – and it worked.

Two years later, Manitoba became the first Canadian province to give women the vote in 1916. She continued to help fight for women's suffrage and equality in other provinces, and advocated for Aboriginal and Asian women's rights during her career as a politician.

212705892082931_559364594083724,"The Q&A excerpt below is from the Epilogue our free eBook, Contender: The Justin Trudeau Story, which outlines Justin Trudeau's origins and the challenges the Liberal Party faces before the 2015 election. It was written by our bureau chief Althia Raj and published in early March

Q: The Trudeau name, the baggage that you carry.. does it bother you?

Justin Trudeau: It is just a fact of my life, and I wouldn't know what it is to live in a different way ... You look at children of successful parents or powerful parents or famous parents and it seems to be an awful burden for so many of them, the fact is my parents were extraordinarily good at giving their children the tools to handle the extra expectations and pressures.

Having a name and baggage like we do means that we have to work extra hard to justify retroactively the doors that automatically open for us. Because there are some that open but it makes it two or three times harder for us to walk through them with our heads held high, if we are going to do it right.

Q: Do you feel that you are part of a dynasty?

JT: No. I understand the sense of connectedness that people have to my family and the association to Canadian politics but dynasties are about passing on hereditary titles and there was nothing hereditary or inevitable about going into politics or even being successful in politics. The way sons of teachers often end up being teachers and daughters of doctors end up being doctors, and many children of politicians end up in politics as well … it is because the experience you get growing up in a political household. So, no, I think that dynasty is an easy shorthand that allows people to explain what is a much more complex phenomenon which has to do with, all things being equal, you are more likely to pick someone you know for a job opening than someone you don't know for a job opening. But dynasty? Nah.

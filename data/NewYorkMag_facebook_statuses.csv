Trump's ideas and my ideas are pretty in tune. I had an epiphany 15 years ago when I said, 'God, I want to own my own business, be a millionaire.' It took me ten years to make my first million, and then that exponentially grew.  People say Trump's not nice. Well, I'm not nice, either. Sometimes harsh words will motivate people.

Meet Jack Dolehide, a 60-year-old doctor from Dubuque, IA. He's supporting Marco Rubio or Donald J. Trump. Here's what he has to say about the candidates:  ""Trump I can't fully trust, though he's a very clever businessman. Ted Cruz is very smart, but the voice drives me crazy.

The black-and-gray one is a hand-poke Japanese tattoo, and the other one is a mix of traditional Japanese and American styles.

Hand-poke? Sounds painful.
It's a long pole that the tattoo artist uses, by hand, to apply the tattoo. It takes a lot longer but doesn't really hurt more than getting an electric tattoo.

Do people approach you about them a lot?
Unfortunately, yes. They draw a lot of attention. I work at the Mandarin Oriental, and it's pretty conservative, so none of my clients ever sees the tattoos. It's my little secret.

How about on the street?
I attract the crazy people. Also, people expose themselves to me.

Really.
I was at a fashion show in Bryant Park, and this woman—I don't want to say her name, but she's a pretty big fashion editor— she basically pulled her pants down and showed me one on her ass cheek.

Are you drawn to other people with tattoos?
Yes. My boyfriend is a tattoo artist. He's pretty much covered in them.

Has he given you one?
He refuses to. He says he doesn't want to take his work home with him.",The Look Book 2008,photo,https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag/photos/a.14993264825.19753.14516439825/20895599825/?type=3,2008-08-11 14:41:50,9,1,2,9,0,0,0,0,0

You two seem, um, very close.
CHARLOTTE: We're not lesbians, we're business partners. We're about to make a music video with my boyfriend, Sean Lennon. It's going to be us hunting Sarabeth; she'll be Diana.

How did you meet?
SARABETH: We met first at a friend's house. Charlotte walked in with one of her breasts hanging out and someone said, ""Hey, your breast is hanging out,"" and she said, ""That's okay, I have another."" CHARLOTTE: She's the coolest person in the world, and I have really good taste. 
SARABETH: We became best friends and traveled the world together. We went to Europe and to L.A., where our car was seized. We both had mental breakdowns.

Breakdowns?
CHARLOTTE: Breakdowns and breakthroughs. SARABETH: We have this very interesting cyclic cycle of energy when we're together that sucks in the most interesting people. 
CHARLOTTE: We're friends with Sean Parker, who invented Napster, who just sold his business for like a billion dollars and always carries around a syringe filled with antidote.

What do you do together, other than attract interesting people?
CHARLOTTE: We used to play a lot of chess together in Washington Square Park with all the homeless men. But then Yoko Ono got me into Go, a Japanese chess game that's more sophisticated.

Do you have summer plans?
CHARLOTTE: We go upstate to this amazing nature preserve and share clothes and money in this utopian way. It's a beautiful farm that Yoko has landscaped, and we eat watermelon and make art. 
SARABETH: We're trying to create a new way of moving forward as a collective so we can make money and help people.

Tell me about a crazy thing you've done recently.
CHARLOTTE: We saved a deer that got hit by a car. We found it on the side of the road. It was foaming and bloody, and we laid on it and hugged and stroked it. It got up twenty minutes later; it had regained its energy.",The Look Book 2008,photo,https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag/photos/a.14993264825.19753.14516439825/18523284825/?type=3,2008-07-21 12:41:04,19,5,8,19,0,0,0,0,0

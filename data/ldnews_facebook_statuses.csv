80335432797_10153466779322798,"Every year in sports, there are new stars that come out of nowhere. But this week, two big-name athletes fell from graces in different ways. Here are our hot takes from the week of sports.

1. Rowdy Ronda Rousey Romped: She can be beaten after all. After her three previous fights lasted a total of 1:04, Rousey was dropped 59 seconds into the second round of her fight with Holly Holm. It wasn't a fluke, either. Rousey was dominated from the beginning. She said she didn't want to get frustrated or she'd end up getting kicked in the head. Well, that's exactly what happened. Kudos to Holm for the victory.

2. Peyton Manning's not so good: Read that to the tune of ""Chicken Parm it tastes so good."" At least that will make you smile a bit. Manning broke Brett Favre's record for most career passing yards, but he'll remember Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs as the game he got benched. He's looked bad all year, but he's officially done. He went 5-20 with four picks. On the season, he has nine touchdowns and 17 interceptions. In hindsight, it would have been nice if Manning retired after last year. But how do you walk away from 4,727 yards and 39 touchdowns just like that? Father Time catches up to everyone eventually.

3. Flightless birds: After losing to the New Jersey Devils 4-0 on Saturday night, the Pittsburgh Penguins let their emotions show. Star forward Evgeni Malkin talked to reporters following the game about what was wrong: ""Everything. We don't play right, we don't work hard. I know it's tough right now, but I know we're mad at each other. We need to stop, look in the mirror…start working. We're not working."" Don't think for once second that what Malkin said was taken out of context, either. He's a smart man, and he meant what he said. At 10-7 on the season, coach Mike Johnston should start looking for real estate elsewhere. He's as good as gone.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ldnews/photos/a.95903532797.94641.80335432797/10153466779322798/?type=3,2015-11-16 19:13:01,13,2,3,13,0,0,0,0,0

The house featured is located at 539 W. Queen St., next to the Brandt Flour Mill.  It may have been built by Abraham Herr (1762-1812). It later became the home to the Bernardo family. When the photo was taken, it was the Stephen family's residence.  The major consensus was that the photo was taken a few days after Tropical Storm Agnes in June 1972, and according to Carol (Stephen) Stewart, the man in the photo next to the overturned car was her father.  The water reached nearly to the top of the 10-foot ceiling of their home, and the three car garage (not shown in the photo) was also destroyed.

Sprecher, in the 'Mystery' photo published Feb. 17. Sprecher is standing in the middle of the photo, with rolled up shirt sleeves and tie. He was the owner the Sprecher Service Station & Garage, and Diner on Route 72, three miles north of Lebanon. Sprecher started the automobile transportation business in 1932 and established the gas station in 1937. The diner, which is now Heisey's Diner, was built in 1941 (and was rebuilt in 1951 to include a dining room). The image was taken in the early 1940s. Foltz recalled working for her father during World War II. Foltz married Thomas B. Foltz, an educator, who passed away in 2014; they were married for 65 years. Only other men identified in the image were Ray Smith, fourth from the right, and Allen Herr, far right in suit and tie. Curtis Kreiser, Christine Rupert and others contributed to the correct information.

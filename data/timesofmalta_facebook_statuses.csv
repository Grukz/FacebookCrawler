 A donation of cash and toys to local charities and Ethiopian famine victims was presented to President Agatha Barbara, but the President appeared to be offended by the contents of a letter which was also handed to her, insisting she would not let anyone involve her in partisan politics. 

She handed the letter back to one of the youths and was then seen approaching a section of the crowd before being calmed down by the police, who intervened to escort her out of the crowd.

The youths then started singing the national anthem and were dispersed by the police while the President  rebuked one of the organisers who had invited her to speak to the crowd.

Cars are seen being driven through Kingsgate, or Porta Reale, in this late 1950s picture of what later became more commonly known as City Gate in Valletta. This gate – the third for Valletta's main entrance – was built in 1853 to designs by Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Ringler Thomson.  

Two statues were placed on either side of the arches, one of Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, the first Grand Master in Malta, and one of Jean Parisot de Valette, the founder of the city. A bronze bust of Pope Pius V, who made significant financial contributions to the building of Valletta, was placed above the archway looking into Strada Reale (Republic Street) in 1892.

The gate was demolished in the summer of 1964 to be replaced by an Italian modernist design by Alziro Bergonzo, which was also demolished and replaced by a Renzo Piano design in 2011.",#TimesGoneBy,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.10153827312413175.1073741841.160227208174/10153822294758175/?type=3,2016-08-22 05:00:00,184,11,20,180,3,0,0,1,0

A hijacked KLM Boeing 747 landed in Luqa airport, the first time a jumbo jet had landed on Maltese islands. 

The aircraft had been flying from Amsterdam to Tokyo with a stop in Beirut. It was hijacked over Iraq early in the morning and landed in Malta without permission after it was refused landing permission elsewhere.

After tense negotiations between the Palestinian gunmen and Prime Minister Dom Mintoff, 225 passengers on aboard were released. Mintoff had refused to refuel the aircraft unless the passengers were released.

The passengers, mostly Japanese, were released during the night between November 26-27 - coming down chutes from the plane as the aircraft stairs available in Malta were unsuitable for a Boeing 747.

The hijackers asked for an Egyptian consul to replace the passengers as a hostage, but the KLM senior vice president for operations, A.W. Witholt, offered himself as hostage and was allowed on the aircraft.

Mr Mintoff was later praised for the tough way he had negotiated with the hijackers. At one point, after the hijackers had agreed to release the passengers, he also requested the release of the air hostesses.

He was heard on the radio telling the hijackers that the hostesses were only of use to them to make tea.

He also told them that he had spoken to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who told him they did not represent anyone and were just young people acting on their own.

""You have no friends, and I am your only friend at the moment. I am trying to help you out but now I am determined to help you only as much as you help me,"" Mr Mintoff was heard to say on two-way radios.

At this juncture, an interpreter told Mr Mintoff that he would not repeat certain words he had told the hijackers because he feared the gunmen would get furious.

The gunmen got furious when Col Gaddafi was mentioned. They said the Libyans had treated them badly ""not like you.""

Eventually the hijackers relented, telling Mr Mintoff that in view of his invaluable help, they were overlooking everything, including their instructions not to release the hostesses, and they were also allowed to disembark. 

The plane then took off and the drama later ended peacefully in Dubai.",#TimesGoneBy,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.10153827312413175.1073741841.160227208174/10153822484378175/?type=3,2016-07-26 05:00:00,176,6,30,160,2,13,0,1,0

Waiting for Mintoff at the airport

Crowd wait for Prime Minister Dom Mintoff at the old airport arrivals terminal in Luqa in 1972. He was returning from Rome where he held tense talks with UK and Nato officials about the use of British military bases here. He initially gave the British forces a deadline to withdraw but then negotiated a settlement which extended the use of the bases to 1979. The talks were given global coverage. The Chicago Tribune reported on January 16, 1972 how Mr Mintoff was given a 'wild homecoming' by a 'frenzied crowd of thousands of chanting and screaming Maltese'.

Apart from showcasing the upcoming summer trends, it features designers who hand-paint and customise shoes and exquisite haute couture collections that resemble works of art, as well as relives The Pink Fashion Show on film and spots the top looks off the catwalk.

Art also takes centre stage with the abstract works of up-and-coming artists, while dance whirls its way into the magazine, discussing the position of female choreographers in a man's world, and its far-reaching beneficial effects on persons with disability, who are finding their showbiz feet.

Apart from its fashion strength, Pink also flexes its muscles in the beauty, health and fitness departments, with a good dose of food, humour and history, always from a female point of view.

Take a stroll down St Ursula Street in Valletta via Places: Design & Living magazine tomorrow and discover its regeneration into a road of boutique hotels, artists' studios, renovations and roof gardens with superb harbour views.

The May issue of the magazine, out with The Sunday Times of Malta tomorrow, also peers into a neo-futuristic fifth-floor penthouse and takes a look at mirrors, both antique and contemporary, to outline their restoration process and show what's available today.

Places also reflects on a variety of workspaces, from those of a religious nature to designer studios – far from the classic image of the messy, paint-splattered studio – and a self-contained, purpose-built residency unit for artists to be inspired.

Tomorrow's issue of the bimonthly magazine, published and produced by Allied Newspapers Ltd and printed by Progress Press, also takes readers on a tour through Milan Design Week, capturing the highlights as seen through the eyes of photographer and architecture student Sean Mallia.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10153675267673175/?type=3,2016-05-07 07:00:00,7,2,1,7,0,0,0,0,0

In tomorrow's issue;

Fragility fractures is estimated to cost the national health service around €17 million, so the work of a team of researchers to discover genetic risk factors that lead to osteoporosis, which targets more women than men, is tackled in tomorrow's issue of Pink.

Out with The Sunday Times of Malta, the leading women's magazine meets the female researchers, who are trying to unravel the root causes of this silent condition, so those with a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis can have tailor-made treatments.

Health dominates the February issue, with a focus on raunchy subjects from the pros, cons and implications of female Viagra to the rise in popularity of cosmetic surgery in private parts.

With Valentine's Day round the corner, softer love also takes centre stage, with a look at the role of matchmakers today and the success stories of modern-day Cupids, while soul mates and teenage romance are also discussed.

Those who pick up their copy of the Sunday newspaper tomorrow will not only find Pink magazine, but also a sample of Versace Eros Pour Femme perfume to try out in the run-up to Valentine's Day.

Pink is a monthly magazine, produced and published by Allied Newspapers Ltd and printed at Progress Press.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10153458220823175/?type=3,2016-02-06 12:29:17,7,2,0,7,0,0,0,0,0

160227208174_10153267829408175,"Government massively exceeding its own wage bill projections - de Marco

Government spending on civil service pay by the end of this year would be €80 million more than it had itself projected, reflecting its incompetence, the Shadow Minister of Finance, Mario de Marco, told parliament this evening.

Speaking in parliament during the Budget debate on the Ministry of Finance, Dr de Marco also observed that in the first two years of this government, recurrent expenditure had increased by 22 per cent, twice the increase in the whole of the last legislature.

It was no wonder, he noted, that credit rating agencies had said that the sharp growth in the civil service could be an issue of concern if the economy did not maintain its growth.

The current economic growth momentum, he said, did not start with this government but under the previous one. The Maltese economy performed better than the EU even during the worst of the international financial crisis.
 
Under the present government, the civil service wage bill – excluding para-statal agencies – had grown sharply - from €612million in 2012 to €790 million. Most of this increase was due to the exaggerated public service recruitment in areas where it was not needed.  

Spending on wages as a percentage of GDP had risen to 9.2 per cent compared to a peak of 8.8 per cent under the former government in 2009. At that time the increase was not because of civil service recruitment but a slowdown in the economy caused by the international financial crisis.   

Public sector consumption now formed a much bigger part of GDP than ever before and was growing faster than the private  sector. 

Dr de Marco also noted that Malta's deficit would have been far wider had the government not received overdue social security contributions from Enemalta. That meant that the government had sold a capital asset and used the funds for its recurrent spending

Under this government, debt had also increased by €600 million, or €25,000 an hour, and Malta had nothing to show for it. The government was even failing to identify new growth areas for the economy.

In his speech Dr de Marco underscored the need for action to improve Malta's economic competitiveness. He stressed that keeping fuel prices high, as the present government was doing, would undermine competitiveness. 

He also spoke on the distribution of wealth and said the number of people at risk of poverty or in poverty had actually increased under the present government.

""The government is interested in headlines more than the poverty line,"" Dr de Marco said. 

He also expressed concern on the level of adequacy of pensions. Measures taken by the government to boost third pillar pensions had not worked, he said. Furthermore he was advocating discussion on possible introduction of second pillar pensions.  He was not saying second pillar pensions should be introduced,but a discussion needed to be held, he said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10153267829408175/?type=3,2015-10-27 13:16:37,12,1,1,12,0,0,0,0,0

""I believe Timber Woods used to live next to Hastings and he had a girlfriend, who was a foreigner. My job brought me into contact with many high-ranking officers, as did my father.""

How to keep children safe is a must-read, while an article on how to massage babies is made for those who are caring for a relatively new member of the family.

For older children, there are articles on encouraging a culture of saving, on using You Tube as an exciting way to educate and on the importance of taking early action concerning bad behaviour at school.

Insights from current research provide yet more reasons to create a close bond with babies and to breastfeed, while a new series shines a spotlight on parents who have been 'heroic' in their own ways.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10152930386243175/?type=3,2015-05-23 00:49:15,9,0,1,9,0,0,0,0,0

Meet the #policewomen who completed their training course with flying colours, outdoing their male counterparts in what is considered to be a male-dominated job, in the December issue of Pink magazine.

The overall best recruit was a female and she, together with the three police constables who placed first, second and third in their course, speak about experiencing taser guns and pepper spray as well as the responsibility that comes with carrying a weapon.

Out with The Sunday Times of Malta tomorrow, Pink also offers readers a touch of #Christmas in feel-good features about new mummies and their first Christmas with their babies, tips for original online gifts, books to read over the holidays or give as presents, how to avoid an explosion with an irritating family member, and combating anxiety in the season that is meant to be jolly.

""They speak about their experience with taser guns and pepper spray""

The #fashion pages feature party dresses for the festivities ahead as well as an interview with the king of glamour, #JulienMacdonald, and four pages of images that capture the vibe at The Pink Fashion Show at Progress Press, held to celebrate the magazine's 10th anniversary last month.

All this and more is packed in a healthy end-of-year issue, which includes horoscopes for the whole of 2015.

#Cancer, kids and #conflict 

Solo parenting is no mean feat and Pink magazine, out with The Sunday Times of Malta tomorrow, delves into what it takes to bring up children alone, while not scrounging off the State.

Mothers from around the world talk about how they are coping with raising children while being the #breadwinners too.

The monthly women's magazine also follows up the #Soroptimist International public forum on ending sexual violence in conflict, focusing on children born from #violence and rape in war, who fall in the gap between their victim mother and abuser father.

In the month that aims to raise breast cancer awareness, survivor Betty Lee exposes her finally fully reconstructed breasts, tattooed areola and all, to show there is also life and hope after the disease.

Health spills over into the fashion scene, with designer bags on sale to raise funds to improve quality of life for cancer patients and their families and finding how to stay sexy while keeping fit.

Pink is produced and published by Allied Newspapers Ltd and printed by Progress Press.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10152462721418175/?type=3,2014-10-18 09:00:01,11,4,0,11,0,0,0,0,0

She is seen receiving her prize from Yunus Emre Tamer, regional commercial manager for the airline. 

We have two #competitions on at the moment - an Iperespresso coffee machine, Illy pods and cups for our Premium Content subscribers and a Vodafone smartphone for our Word Game fanatics. Have you taken part yet?

#Malta #TimesofMalta #news #newspapers #Turkey

And here is Sonya's poem! 

The Aya Sofya, majestic and fine -
Its glittering mosaics are so divine,

The Topkapi Palace, with its Turkish Bath
And courtyards and kiosks and the Harem path,

The steamy bathhouses and massage rooms,
Stupendous domes and Royalty Tombs,

The Blue Mosque with six minarets, Iznic tiles,
The various museums depicting all styles

Of great architecture that came with the years -
A history of battles won amongst such fears ...

The Galata Tower there in Beyoğlu.
Stands high o'er the city and beckons to you -

The view is breathtaking - the city below
Is unique in all ways, wherever you go....

The Bosphorous shimmers, its waters so clear -
The beauty around you's more than you can bear.  

All this makes Istanbul a real special place
That memories remain in your heart, always .........",Competition winners,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.10152225589703175.1073741831.160227208174/10152264782578175/?type=3,2014-07-16 07:50:04,84,18,2,84,0,0,0,0,0

Bed shortage. Political interference. Waste. Pushy unions… All listed in a 2012 health review report which chronicled the problems plaguing Mater Dei Hospital. So why do the same problems persist in 2014? Why does the Pharmacy of Your Choice initiative remain saddled by high costs?

The health sector will be under the spotlight in today's edition of Times Talk.

The main guests on the programme are Health Minister Godfrey Farrugia, Opposition spokesman Claudio Grech and Saint James Hospital chairman Josie Muscat.

Viewers are urged to send their questions and comments on timesofmalta.com and on the Facebook and Twitter pages of Times Talk.

The Prime Minister asked the Opposition leader to substantiate his claims or withdraw them. The Speaker ruled a prima facie breach of privilege. Were the Nationalist MPs right to walk out of Parliament in protest?

Illegal hunting and graffiti will be under the spotlight tonight when Times of Malta's #TIMEStalk goes on air.

Presented by Times of Malta's head of media Herman Grech and chief reporter Mark Micallef, backed by the biggest newsroom in Malta, #Timestalk will be screened on TVM at 6.55pm with a repeat on TVM2 at 10.15pm. It is the same team behind The Big Debate, the widely-acclaimed leaders' election debate last February.

Present for the first half of the programme will be hunters' federation CEO Lino Farrugia and Birdlife Malta president Joseph Mangion.

The second part of the programme will discuss whether graffiti is art or vandalism. The guests are contemporary artist Pierre Portelli, graffiti and mural artist James Micallef Grimaud, and architect specialised in conservation Edward Said.

You don't have to be David Beckham to be a hero to your kids.

It's Fathers' Day on Sunday and timesofmalta.com is making an appeal to readers who would like to nominate their father, stepfather, grandfather or even great grandfather as the best dad ever.

At times, the little heroic acts of dads seem to fade in the background but we believe that they deserve to be in the limelight as much as any celebrity. So email us today on fathersday@timesofmalta.com with your story, photos and videos clips.

The best stories will be featured in the paper on Sunday.

An elderly man was seriously injured in a crash at Tal-Barrani road this morning.

The crash took place at the intersection to Zejtun at about 7.30 a.m. The traffic lights were reportedly off at the time.

The crash involved a VW Golf driven by a 48-year-old from Marsa heading towards Birzebbuga and a green Maruti 800 driven by a 75-year-old from Zejtun.

The Maruti, which was crossing the road towards Zejtun, was overturned and pushed into a wall with the force of impact. The driver was trapped in his vehicle and was rescued by Civil Protection rescuers using cutting equipment.

The driver of the other vehicle was not hurt, but both vehicles were extensively damaged.

The Labour Party has won a huge general election victory, sweeping to power with a majority of 55% or some 20,000 votes.
The party is expected to have a parliamentary majority of between five and seven seats.
Supporters are pouring into the streets in celebration heading towards Labour headquarters in Hamrun, honking their horns and waving white Labour flags as well as some of the old red ones.
This is Labour;s first Labour victory in 16 years and its biggest since the immediate post-war era.
Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi conceded defeat after the first sample as the sorting of ballot papers started. He phoned Joseph Muscat to congratulate him.
In the Naxxar counting hall there were scenes of jubilation as Labour party agents hugged each other with tears in their eyes.
Fireworks were let off in some localities
Optimism and enthusiasm had been building early in the Labour ranks as opinion polls showed their party consistently in the lead and as vote turnout figures last night showed an appreciable drop only in the PN-leaning districts.
Small crowds started gathering in mid-morning outside PL headquarters and in various squares.
In Cospicua, a man said (at 10 a.m.) that he was sure Labour would win, but, he said, they were holding off celebrations for now because of what happened five years ago (when celebrations were short lived because it was the PN which actually won)
""Even Bormlizi who never voted, not even for Mintoff, came out to vote yesterday,"" one elderly man said.
Another man said that five years ago he was celebrating with PN but now he felt that he was in the right place celebrating with Labour",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10151336534543175/?type=3,2013-03-10 06:05:35,120,8,58,120,0,0,0,0,0

 A front-page picture carried in The Times today as well as video footage carried yesterday has raised a wave of anger on the social media, with people voicing consternation over the attire of the accused, as well as their attitude.

The five were seen entering the law courts building in the afternoon wearing shorts and T-shirts and carrying soft drink bottles. They were taken to court in a police van, more than 24-hours after a brawl at Il-Maghluq, Marsaxlokk, where a man was assaulted during a protest over illegal camping.

Some of the arraigned were wearing the same clothes they had worn at the beach.

A number of people entering the law courts to follow proceedings were also seen wearing shorts.

The norm is for smart clothes, including jacket and tie.

Many writing on the social media also complained about the sentence meted out by the court after the accused pleaded guilty - a fine of €60 each. One of the accused admitted committing a crime during the operative period of a suspended sentence and had his term extended by two years.

The following are some comments seen on facebook:

""Sadly the photograph on the front page of today's printed Times is not (yet) reproduced online which is a pity as it shows the Famous Five after they were fined €60 each. Naturally Perhaps one of the many avvocati, avvocatini, avvocatoni or avvocatucci that exist within this hallowed Republic can explain to me what ""suspended sentence"" really means! From what I garnered up to now, it means getting away with what you've done and then being allowed to take part in at least one brawl! Fair enough""...

Should teens have technology in their bedrooms? Pink asks their mothers. How demeaning have adverts been towards females? The magazine chronicles publicity through the ages.

Why do some women shun Christmas? It gets to the heart of the matter in tomorrow's December issue, out with The Times tomorrow.

Fashion also takes pride of place with pages of accessories, trends and top gifts; as well as encounters with style gurus, insight into luxurious fragrances and a 16-page catalogue of Gaba jewellery for readers to find their choice gems at their fingertips.

But the upcoming festive season also seeps into the magazine, which profiles the standard – and dysfunctional – family lunch on Christmas Day, and offers guidelines on how to ensure it turns out to be a peaceful and sane event.

From the health point of view, the problems of sufferers of eating disorders are aggravated over this period as they have to face forced feeding at family gatherings and shopping for party dresses that tends to hammer their problems home.

The December issue also contains its fair share of history, humour, horoscopes and home décor, which focuses on Christmas crafts on a budget, but an abundance of creativity.

It also includes its usual fix of fitness, books, cookery and the best parties so far in the build-up to the festive season.

A 20-year-old mother, who was reduced to a vegetative state in a motorbike accident a year ago, has finally left hospital – despite her family being told she would be confined to a home for the elderly for life.

But Anna Bajada is as much a fighter as her daughter Angie, and apart from raising the rest of her family and her two-year-old granddaughter, she is making sure to improve the quality of life of her semi-conscious child.

Pink catches up with the three generations to see how hope is propelling them through the ordeal of coping with a daughter they can barely communicate with, and feeds directly through a hole in her belly, despite the frustrating fact that she can smell, taste and loves her food.

In tomorrow's issue of the magazine, Pink also gets to know a 60-year-old grandmother and her motives behind placing a personal advert to find a husband.

It also signs up to the social networking site Badoo to understand the way the virtual clubbing scene has been brought into the bedroom and the changing face of dating, highlighting that the art of chatting up has taken on a whole new dimension.

Before Dr John Briffa, a specialist in nutrition and weight loss, renowned in the UK, launches his latest book on escaping the diet trap in January, he has chosen Malta as the first place to reveal the ground-breaking concepts contained in it.
In Pink's fitness pages, he turns the tables on conventional dieting, binning the typical calorie counting, portion control… and consequent hunger.

The sixth issue of On Parade, the annual publication of the Armed Forces of Malta, will be distributed with The Times today on the eve of the army's Open Day.

This publication offers an insight into the operations Maltese troops are involved in, particularly overseas, as well as soldiers' training, new equipment acquisitions, overhauls and EU-funded projects.

Sunday's AFM's Open Day will be held at Luqa Barracks from 10 a.m. This all-day family event will showcase varied skills and work performed by army units.

These include dynamic displays, aerial ropeways, helicopter demonstrations, abseiling and unarmed combat. The newly acquired Air Wing's Maritime Patrol Aircraft King Air will perform a flypast.

A weapons stand, scale models and other static display stands, assets and capabilities will be set up around the barracks and personnel will be providing detailed explanations to the public. Refreshments, warm meals and a children's play area will be available. The day will be capped with a Changing of the Guard ceremony and Beating the Retreat by the AFM Band at 6 p.m.

On Parade is designed by Mediamaker Ltd and printed by Progress Press, both members of the Allied Group of Companies. It is edited by the Headquarters AFM's Public Information Cell.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10150309627158175/?type=3,2011-10-01 01:45:35,10,1,0,10,0,0,0,0,0

160227208174_10150291221058175,"Four cover versions of Pink

The multifaceted September issue of Pink magazine will be available in four different covers tomorrow, so readers can take their pick or collect all the versions.

It is the last edition to be produced in the present format before it is resized to more manageable dimensions next month, in keeping with market preferences, while continuing with its usual level of content and dose of regulars.

From one inspirational man and his handling of imminent death to another extra/ordinary woman, championing animal welfare by chance, the magazine, distributed with The Times, profiles individuals who have a singular tale to tell.

Three creative ladies string together more than just a couple of sentences in FashionStory, crafting their own bespoke jewellery and the upcoming trends of the autumn/winter season show that history repeats itself even in terms of fashion.

The rest of Pink is replete with culture, cuisine, books, beauty, fitness and fun, humour and horoscopes, health and those who live a holistic lifestyle, psychology and events.

Published by Allied Newspapers Ltd and printed by Progress Press, Pink is produced by Mediamaker. Its executive editor is Fiona Galea Debono and it is designed by Helen Cassar Torreggiani and Manuel Schembri.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10150291221058175/?type=3,2011-09-16 06:10:43,11,0,1,11,0,0,0,0,0

Few people will forget the surreal moment ten years ago when they saw planes smashing into New York's iconic Twin Towers.

The horrific attacks, which unfolded live on millions of TV screens, left 3,000 people dead and the rest of the world stunned.
As part of an anniversary feature for September 11th, timesofmalta.com is inviting readers to send in their comments and experiences.

Where were you when you heard the news? How did you react? Were you worried for family or friends? Were you about to catch a plane and had second thoughts?  Did you happen to be close to New York at the time? Or were completely distracted by a momentous episode in your own life (e.g. mourning a loved one or giving birth)?

The Times is looking to compile the memories of Maltese people in a way that helps us sensitively mark this tragic episode which shaped the course of history.

Child - One of the most important developments in local education for the past few years was the launch of the draft curriculum framework a few days ago. When approved, it will establish the quality and direction of schooling for years to come.
Parents have been asked to provide feedback on the document and tomorrow, Child magazine, out free with The Times, offers a reader-friendly introduction to the ideas it contains. It is essential reading for all parents interested in their children's education.
More guidance abounds in the magazine, ranging from healthy nutrition to dealing with bullies, tips on internet research with children to some sound advice for mothers-to-be on Caesarian births. Overall it is yet another edition of Child, published by Allied Newspapers and produced by Mediamaker, that readers will want to keep for future reference.

160227208174_10150184034303175,"Ninety per cent of those afflicted with lupus, the as yet incurable chronic illness of the immune system, are women, 80 per cent are between the ages of 15 and 35 and about 180 are estimated to be suffering from the disease in Malta.
On the occasion of World Lupus Day, which was celebrated last week, Pink magazine's health section sheds light on the many faces of the illness – no two lupus patients present with similar symptoms and three women from various walks of life talk about how it has affected them individually.
Lupus is neither infectious, nor contagious, but patients prefer to hide it. Moreover, early diagnosis can make a major difference, which is why Pink tackles the subject and raises awareness in the May issue, out with The Times tomorrow.
Mother's Day, also celebrated this month, could not go by unnoticed in the women's magazine. But Pink has opted to pay tribute to the truly great grandmothers, who have dedicated themselves to taking care of their children's children so that they can continue with their lives.
The pros and cons of resorting to full-time nannies are also tackled in a story that focuses on those mothers who have no one to turn to in order to assist them in child care.
But it is not only mothers and children who feature in Pink. Women have other roles too and the magazine gets the rules of the game from Malta's top-class female referee as regards fielding the insults of the male fans at the stadium – but worse still, those of her own sex too. The article fires questions on whether football is as sexist sport and Esther Azzopardi calls the shots.
As always, fashion too plays a central role, with a sizzling bikini shoot and pages on accessories and trends, while beauty also makes it on to the cover with a sample of the new Scholl Hard Skin Softening cream for readers to try and test.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10150184034303175/?type=3,2011-05-20 04:29:19,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0

A man's determination can be inspiring and life affirming, even when it is life itself that is at risk. Designer and art director Carlo Schembri is one determined man. When, just one week before his wedding, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, he battled on through hours of interventions and rehabilitations to survive.
In M magazine, which is out tomorrow, Davinia Hamilton meets Mr Schembri to see what makes him a survivor.
Determination is also what fuels men who, having studied for and practised a particular profession, decide to make a leap straight out of their comfort zone. Sandy Calleja Portelli interviews two men who had the courage to change careers.
Men are stereotypically pictured as carnivorous hunters who relish the prospect of a juicy slab of red meat. Not all men, however, fit this portrait, as Velislava Hillman finds out when she meets two committed male vegetarians.
Love is more beautiful when played against a musical background – Veronica Stivala listens to the love story of musicians Jennifer Micallef and Wayne Marshall.
M also takes a look at Felix Busuttil's photo album, cooks up a seafood treat, and watches on as an Inter fan marries a Milanista wife.
M magazine will be out tomorrow with The Times. Published by Allied Newspapers Ltd, it's designed by MediaMaker Ltd and printed by Progress Press Ltd. Its editor is Stanley Borg.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10150166387933175/?type=3,2011-04-29 09:36:08,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

160227208174_10150113648448175,"In Malta, only one couple with severe disabilities is married and lives independently. Husband and wife, both Muscular Dystrophy sufferers, with barely any mobility, want to serve as role models for others in similar situations and are proof that romance and disability are not incompatible.
The March issue of Pink, which is out with The Times tomorrow, discovers how couples with physical and intellectual disability manage to develop their intimate relationships and express their feelings of love, despite their limitations.
Not even their wheelchairs can keep them apart and they have accepted to share their matrimonial bed with respiratory machines, needing someone to place their hands on each other and having a hard time to kiss on their wedding day.
These and other lovebirds have chosen to open up about their right to a relationship and their emotional and sexual needs, which are no different from anyone else's.
International Women's Day has been done – and overdone – this month. But for Pink, which has always highlighted female issues, every edition marks it. Whether it is a woman's world is the burning question, especially in the aftermath of revolutionary uprisings, which are supposed to bring about change and freedom.
After the US-led invasion, Iraqi females are still being oppressed. They tell Pink they have lost their basic freedoms and are forced to cover up, fearing sexual violence that is keeping professionals in their homes and away from work.
Look out for a burst of floral fashion, loads of beauty tips from various angles and the usual regulars on food, fitness, psychology, books, cars, homes, history and humour.
Published by Allied Newspapers Ltd and printed by Progress Press, Pink is produced by Mediamaker. Its executive editor is Fiona Galea Debono and it is designed by Helen Cassar Torreggiani and Joseph Schembri.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/timesofmalta/photos/a.418054008174.193462.160227208174/10150113648448175/?type=3,2011-03-18 09:34:10,9,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0

Photo: Mark Laferla JrRescuers are looking for a man who is reported missing in the 15 August Fireworks Factory explosion which rocked Malta at precisely 3 p.m. today, sending a big mushroom shaped cloud over the area.A number of ambulances were immediately rushed to the area.The explosion was heard practically across Malta, with readers reporting hearing it in Marsascala and Mellieha. Some said there had been three explosions, of which one was significantly bigger than the others.Mark Laferla, a reader from San Pawl tat-Targa, said it seemed like the burning wreckage landed in nearby fields and started multiple smaller fires.Doors and windows, he said, shook and it felt similar to an earthquake.The blast is the fourth involving a fireworks factory this year.Two people died in a blast at St Sebastian fireworks factory near Qormi in Febrruary and another man died in an explosion between Zejtun and Marsaxlokk in May but there were no injuries in an explosion at a Gharghur fireworks factory in April.",http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100813/local/mosta-fireworks-factory-explodes,link,http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100813/local/mosta-fireworks-factory-explodes,2010-08-13 09:01:08,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

Smith had straight A's in math and computer science. Would that count? No, Bell said, it would not. Undaunted by this initial rejection, Smith called back every day for two weeks — HR stopped answering after Day 2 — and then cut back on how often he called …to every Monday for five months. Eventually, he was rewarded for his doggedness. After an MIT student didn't show up in June, Bell called Smith. Could he come in for an interview?

But after getting knocked to the ground, George was never taken back to the locker room to be seen by doctors or trainers. Instead, he stayed in the game-visibly looking like a shell of himself-until it was over. It seems clear the Pacers defied NBA policy by not checking him for a concussion.

Methodology:

To produce our Most Promising list, we started with the premise that one metric-like revenue or valuation-doesn't say much about a company's overall health. Instead we strove for a holistic gauge, trying to pin down companies' trajectories by looking at a slew of variables. Over the course of six months we reviewed thousands of applications from businesses across the country. The final assessment is based on growth (both in sales and hiring), quality of management team and investors, margins, market size and key partnerships. We turned to CB Insights, which specializes in assessing private companies for hedge funds and venture capital firms, to refine our search. Their Mosaic software, developed with the help of $650,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation, scans 45,000 digital sources to measure a company's health. A new distribution deal, for example, marks a positive signal, while the loss of an executive is a negative. Mosaic gathers those myriad signals into a score that FORBES uses as an initial guide in producing the list. After verifying sales numbers, speaking with each company and debating their merits and blemishes, we end up with the final ranking.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/forbes/photos/a.261046322508.142916.30911162508/10151406366857509/?type=3,2013-02-06 12:00:28,131,5,44,131,0,0,0,0,0

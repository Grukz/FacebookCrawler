""The threat was made in the Taft Hall C wing boys' bathroom and reported by a student. The threat said, ""I'm going to bomb Shaker on 6/14/14 Watch."" Due to the lack of specificity, the shelter in place mode was chosen. This is a method that has been developed in conjunction with the Colonie PD and is part of our district emergency response plan.

When a person exited the residence to check on the man around 11:45 a.m. Sunday, he was dead, Desmond said.",,status,,2014-02-09 17:31:06,8,7,4,8,0,0,0,0,0

Central Avenue is a nightmare, and pedestrians step out of nowhere in front of you. Another danger area is westbound on Clinton Avenue as you cross Pearl Street in front of the Palace Theatre.

There is no parking from Pearl to Chapel Street, but cars seem to be constantly stopping or parked at the curb there, obstructing the view of the crosswalk or impeding traffic. Clinton has two westbound lanes east of Pearl Street that can flow safely past the Palace if the curb is free as signs intend.

I know it's costly, because he spent a night in trauma in the ER and then two nights in ICU. ... His femur bone had to be replaced."" (Paul Buckowski / Times Union)

The Times Union Brendan Lyons's story says: According to a new study by New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, the lifetime cost of being shot — per victim — is about $64,000. 

Could a gun-microstamping program help curb those costs?

Last week, the Democratic Assembly passed a bill to legalize medical marijuana. It's not expected to get through the Republican-led Senate this year. It's been that way for years.

But what many people don't know is that medical marijuana has actually been legal since 1980. Under an obscure law that was passed 32 years ago, medical marijuana was legalized for research purposes.

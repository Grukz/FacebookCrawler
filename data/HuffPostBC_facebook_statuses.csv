No tsunami alert was issued and no damage has been recorded in the sparsely populated area. 

The quakes were the Cascadia subduction zone where two plates of the Earth's crust meet and seismic activity is common. 

The squeezing of the plates causes about 300 small tremors every year in southwestern B.C., but Natural Resources warns the plates could eventually snap loose, causing a devastating offshore earthquake with a magnitude of 9 or greater.

The last time such a quake happened was in 1700.

Vancouver and communities across the country have a longstanding commitment to welcoming refugees and their families in times of need. This is at the heart of our inclusive, compassionate, and diverse city.
 
Vancouver has taken steps to increase our capacity to welcome refugees, and we will continue to do so – the City has contributed $4.1 million in land and grants for the construction of an innovative new Vancouver Welcome House for refugees.
 
In responding to the current crisis, we are building on the momentum of the Syrian refugee forum we held in September at City Hall, which brought together key settlement experts and hundreds of members of the public who wanted to learn more about how our community can do its part to help.
 
Today, Deputy Mayor Reimer represented the City in joining a Call for Action to help support the Syrian Refugee resettlement to BC. We have started working with Immigrant Services Society of BC and other key supporters, including the Mayors of other cities such as Coquitlam and Surrey.
 
In the coming months, local governments and agencies are collectively committed to assisting Syrian refugees settling in the Lower Mainland.  
 
These new arrivals will come with little more than their families and hope. They need help finding housing and jobs, learning English and navigating a new culture and city.
 
I encourage you find out how you can help welcome our new arrivals by visiting the Immigrant Settlement Services (ISS) of BC website at: ISSBC.org.
 
Working together with ISS of BC, the City is helping coordinate a response to support refugees in Vancouver by providing information for people with offers of donations, looking to volunteer or get more information. You can also find out how to help by visiting vancouver.ca or through the VanConnect App.
 
When I recently spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau, one of the first things I expressed was the willingness of Vancouver to help with the successful integration of refugees in our communities.
 
We know that civic facilities, including libraries and communities centres will be important venues for our newcomers' sense of belonging. These places allow Syrian and other refugees a place to learn language and connect with others.
 
I am proud that the City will continue to work with federal and provincial partners as well as local community groups to help give our new arrivals a true Vancouver welcome.""

I am looking forward to working with Prime Minister Trudeau and his cabinet as we continue to build a stronger, more-prosperous Canada and British Columbia.""

A family was in the Lost Lagoon area of the park around 2 p.m., when a man grabbed their two year old. The girl's father confronted the man, who let the toddler go before he escaped. 

The suspect, 28, was later arrested in the 1800 block of Alberni Street. He is believed to be the same man who tried to grab an eight-year-old girl at near the Stanley Park seawall on Friday.

He remains in police custody.

""We are thankful the arrest was made without any injuries to our officers, the general public, or Teneycke,"" said police.

ORIGINAL POST: A manhunt is underway in Oliver, B.C. for Ronald Teneycke, a prolific offender who allegedly robbed a store before assaulting a driver and stealing his vehicle.

Teneycke's truck was found in a rural area on a forest service road east of the town. Police are currently doing a full-scale search of the area.

Oliver RCMP said that Teneycke posed as a hitchhiker and when a man driving a 1999 White GMC picked him up, Teneycke allegedly assaulted him with a weapon and stole the truck.

The truck has B.C. licence plate 7621 GG, with ""Okanagan Rustic Furniture"" written across the back window.

Teneycke was in the news in 2007 after serving an eight-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting a teenage girl.

Police believe Teneycke is extremely dangerous and may be armed. They're also asking that people did not disclose details of the manhunt on social media for everyone's safety.

""We thank our customers for their patience and apologize for the major inconvenience they experienced this afternoon because of the SkyTrain delay. The delay occurred at the peak of rush hour service, which affected our most regular daily customers. While we recognize the inconvenience and longer commute times, we appreciate their patience and calm behaviour while our staff worked to repair the problem and help redirect customers via alternate means.
 
While the specific cause of the delay is still under investigation, a technical issue at 4:10 p.m. caused 19 trains between Royal Oak and Waterfront stations to stop running. Expo Line trains continued to run between Edmonds and King George stations, and Millennium Line trains continued to run between Columbia and VCC-Clark stations.
 
Many trains were stopped between stations; several were attended by a SkyTrain Attendant within 5-10 minutes and driven manually to the nearest station. Staff attended the majority of the remainder of the trains within 30 minutes.
 
Customers broke out of three different trains in the Nanaimo SkyTrain area, so we had to turn off power in the area to ensure customers were safe and clear of trains. Attending to these customers delayed SkyTrain system recovery by an additional hour.
 
25 buses provided shuttle service between affected stations. We deployed over 100 staff to help customers, respond to questions and assist with crowds – including 60 SkyTrain Attendants on trains and at stations; 16 Transit Police officers and five Transit Security units; 13 support staff; and eight transit supervisors.
 
7 additional technicians worked to bring the system back on as quickly as possible.
 
By 6:10 p.m., we were able to provide some service with SkyTrain Attendants manually driving trains in the affected area. We restored full service by 6:45 p.m.""

The officer, who was off-duty at the time, was out for a walk when he saw smoke and flames coming from a home, said a news release. When he knocked on the door, a woman answered and said her granddaughter was trapped inside.

Without any protective gear, King rushed into the house, and through thick smoke, felt his way to the girl. He then scooped her up and brought her safely outside.

The cause of the fire has not been determined but police do not believe it's suspicious.

The scary incident began on Thursday evening when the 44-year-old woman was driving an older model Ford Escort on Brechin Road, said police. The driver of a late '90s Ford F150 truck pulled up and yelled something but she ignored him. He continued to follow her, honk his horn and flash his lights.

Thinking there was something wrong with her vehicle, she slowed down. The man then cut his truck in front of her forcing her to pull over and stop.

He walked to her door and said ""I want to take you for coffee."" As she tried to power up her window, he reached in and grabbed her. She broke his grip by speeding off. ""She was left with bruising on her arm and was traumatized by her ordeal,"" said RCMP.

 The suspect is described as:
·         white , 40's, good looking  with an athletic build
·         salt and pepper hair in a military style cut
·         pale, clean shaven,light coloured eyes

·         cleft shin and white mark on the bridge of nose, similar to a scar

On March 20, 1917, a tenant named Robert Tait who lived in an apartment above a grocery store on East Georgia Street was threatening his landlord. When police arrived, Tait fired a rifle through the door, injuring the landlord and an officer who both lost an eye each.

While police waited for backup, Tait fired out of his window, killing an eight-year-old boy who was going to the store below to buy candy.

Chief MacLennan left his own 10-year-old son's birthday party to attend and supervise the standoff. When negotiations failed, he lead a team into the apartment. 

Tait, armed with two rifles, two revolvers and a shotgun, shot and killed MacLennan as he came through the door. The ensuing gun battle ended when Tait killed himself before he could be arrested.

MacLennan also left a legacy of authorizing the formation of the Vancouver Police Pipe Band, which continues today.

Scarff is charged with four counts of sexual interference and two counts of invitation to sexual touching on multiple persons under the age of 16. He's been released under several conditions.

Surrey RCMP are concerned there may be more victims who have not come forward. Anyone with more info can contact the Child Abuse and Sexual Offence Unit at 604-599-0502 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS if you wish to remain anonymous.

He was trying to impress all the gang members and his family was just fed up with him because he was out there shooting, he was gang-banging, he was doing everything that his parents didn't want. But when I met this young man for the first time I kind of stood off to the side while other officers were talking down to him. Everyone was attacking him and I thought, 'Nobody's talking good to him, I'm gonna go over and do that.' When they were done I said 'Let me talk to you. What's going on with you? Tell me your side of the story.' We built a friendship and I got to visiting him at his house several times. He didn't really change after that first conversation, but after that second or third time, and him seeing me keeping my word about coming back to the house, it changed him. I said, 'It's not too late to be something different. Family's always first. When those guys you're hanging with leave you, you'll have to come back home. They're the ones who'll open their door for you.' He needed someone to respond to him and give him positive reinforcement. That's all he needed. He turned around. He's not even gang-banging anymore. He's at Ivy Tech now, learning a trade."" E.C. Officer Will Askew.

In a speech at West Point tonight, President Barack Obama is scheduled to reveal a buildup of as many as 30,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Join members of nwi.com and the Northwest Indiana community in gathering background material, links, tweets, video and other assorted pieces of information in the hours leading up to the President's speech.

Then tonight, during the 7 p.m. speech, share your reaction here. I envision this as a crowdsource/crowd-aggregation experiment followed by a chat.
Comments are on the record, which hopefully won't sway people from voicing their opinion, and will help foster a spirited, focused debate.

If you would like a Google Wave invite, many of us have some left. Email me and I can put you in contact with others.

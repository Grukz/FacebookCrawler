5863113009_10153712376908010,"We pulled out the best for you. Here's what the pope had to say to Congress on:

INEQUALITY
""A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk.""

IMMIGRATION
""We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants.""

""On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation.""

DEATH PENALTY
""Recently my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation.""

ARMS TRADE
""Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.

She never became a household name, but the grainy photos of her crumpled on the side of the road in Selma, Ala., after being tear-gassed and beaten by state troopers came to be one of the most searing images of America's civil rights struggle.

Though she was clubbed, gassed and left splayed along the road in the first attempt to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Boynton Robinson's resolve to fight for change only seemed to deepen.

She was invited later that year to the White House when President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. She became the first black woman to run for Congress in Alabama.

And in March — 50 years after the violence in Selma — she crossed the span again, this time in a wheelchair and pushed along by President Obama.

""We sat many Saturday nights in front of the TV in my mother-in-law's living room.  Mama Chole on her big floral couch, my kids snuggled around her eating Hershey Kisses from her fancy candy bowl as we watched ""Sabado Gigante"" with Don Francisco's baritone voice booming through her Monterey Park house. These were our inter-generational bonding moments. Mama Chole spoke very little English. My kids hardly spoke Spanish. But ""Sabado Gigante"" brought us together for some laughs, a good-old fashioned American family hour, Latino style. My husband and I cringed at the skits and scantily-clad dancers. But we were all together.  As Mama Chole aged and her hearing went, the ""Sabado Gigante"" volume grew uncomfortably loud. We still watched.  When she was bed-ridden, on went ""Sabado Gigante"" on the living room television, even though there was no one on the couch anymore. Every so often, I still catch my husband holed up in our den watching the show alone.""

""'Looper' is way inventive, but it wears its creativity lightly, like it's no big deal. This is a highflying, super-stylish science-fiction thriller that brings a fresh approach to mind-bending genre material. We're not always sure where this time-travel film is going, but we wouldn't dream of abandoning the ride.""

In short, Romney is going to be the beneficiary of what you might call the 'media bounce.'""

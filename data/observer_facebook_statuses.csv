""""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."" That's the basic gestalt psychology principle. And that's the general idea behind a mosaic. Even though I have been dedicated to this art form for over 20 years, I am still fascinated by the opportunities for expression that a mosaic offers. Composition-wise, I emphasized the movement of numbers. I wanted to create an organic and chaotic structure. In the last eight years, big changes have shaken the economy of the U. S. and the rest of the world, so, this portrait expresses continuous movement. In the end I wanted the viewer to be uncertain about what comes first; are the numbers creating the president or is the president creating the numbers!""",Observer's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/observer/photos/a.10150835881196620.466214.9665781619/10154578515166620/?type=3,2016-12-20 15:57:42,29,9,11,21,5,0,2,0,1

With the start of 2016, we are looking forward to finally reopening our doors at Carnegie Deli under original family ownership once again.  It has been a long, difficult process since our temporary closing. What we thought would be a couple of days have spiraled into one complication after another, including various inspections and significant but necessary renovations which unexpectedly have taken much longer than any of us thought. We have sincerely missed our loyal customers over the past several months and it's been hard on our family and our employees.

However, as sure as pickles are served at every meal, Carnegie Deli will reopen this year! My daughter Sarri Harper and I will look forward to swinging open our front doors again and welcoming everyone back soon.

It is time set the record straight about how most affordable housing in New York City is built [""Mayor's Mandate: Experts Fear Affordable Upzoning Plan Will Fall Short,"" Dec 10].

There is a widespread misconception that inclusionary zoning is the only way to incentivize the construction of new affordable housing and reach the Mayor's goal to create and preserve 200,000 affordable units in the next decade. In reality, there are many tools developers can use to help solve the City's affordability crisis and provide housing for New York City households at a range of incomes.

Even with an inclusionary zoning mandate on the horizon, many of the 200,000 units will be built with city, state and federal programs – such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax exempt bonds – which are the real drivers behind affordable housing.

HPD and HDC have worked with the affordable housing development community to finance hundreds of thousands of units over the past several decades. In many places this investment has revitalized communities by transforming vacant land and abandoned buildings into affordable housing.

The de Blasio administration should be commended for increasing City support for affordable housing programs and recognizing the critical role that public resources play in building and preserving this valuable resource. 

The Observer does readers a disservice by suggesting the Mayor's plan is unrealistic in presenting such a narrow view of the affordable housing industry in New York City.

9665781619_10152218395386620,"￼The Observer received the following letter to the editor from Anthony C. Wood, author of ""Preserving New York: Winning the Right to Protect a City's Landmarks"": 

To the Editor:

Despite the spin doctoring attempted in Steven Spinola's Op-Ed piece (February 24,

2014) from the beginning REB NY has been both hostile towards and wrong about

preservation. Having testified against the proposed Landmarks Law, when the law was

ultimately passed in 1965 John R. O'Donoghue, the executive secretary ofthe owners

division of REBNY warned in the New York Times that the new law would ""seriously

impede the modem expansion and progress of the city."" REBNY's predictive skills have

not improved over time. In 1986, protesting the now highly successful Ladies' Mile

historic district, Steven Spinola, REBNY's president declared in a letter in the New York

Times: ""Landmark restrictions on this commercial area will have a chilling effect on the

renovations and adaptations of long-vacant buildings, which have helped transform the

area into a vibrant retail and commercial district."" Wrong again.

Reality has not gotten in the way of REBNY's opposition to historic districts. In January

of 1988, Spinola was at it again testifying against the proposed Central Park West

Historic District, ""I'm sure it will come as no surprise when I say the Board opposes the

creation of the proposed Central Park West Historic District. We are often criticized for

our unwillingness to accept historic districts. And it's true, that in the past we have

opposed, rather than supported, most districts. Our opposition really began with the

Upper East Side Historic District, and has continued to the other large districts such as

Ladies' Mile and this one. And our opposition will continue, as long as we believe that

historic districts are proposed as development control mechanisms.""

As Senator Moynihan famously liked to say, ""Everyone is entitled to his own opinion but

not to his own facts."" The fact is that REBNY is ideologically opposed to historic

districts despite their proven record of success. REBNY a friend of preservation? With

friends like that who needs enemies?",REBNY Has Been a Loyal Friend to Preservation,link,http://observer.com/2014/02/rebny-has-been-a-loyal-friend-to-preservation/,2014-02-26 14:38:11,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

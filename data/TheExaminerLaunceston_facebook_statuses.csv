Mention the name Michael Flatley, and most people think Riverdance - or more recently Lord of the Dance.

The world's most successful dance show is about to explode onto the Australian stage from September 10 opening in Hobart with a spectacular new staging of Flatley's masterpiece - Lord of the Dance: Dangerous Games.

The theatrical extravaganza will then tour to Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sydney.

Flatley's new show Dangerous Games has exciting and ground-breaking new technology, including holographs, dancing robots, world champion acrobats, and 34 of the greatest Irish Dancers in the world. A new score composed by Gerard Fahy, new choreography, stunning new costumes and special effect lighting add a breath-taking new dimension to
the original masterpiece.

Thanks to the promoters, The Examiner has FIVE DOUBLE PASSES for the Hobart performance to give away to our Facebook friends. The tickets are for the Thursday, September 10 performance at 8pm. Each double pass is valued at $199.80 for the double.

To go in the running to win, all you have to do is tell us in what country was Michael Flatley born by posting the answer below? (Hint: don't assume, okay?)

One friend described Brittany as a loving and caring person who cared about her friends and was just there for everyone.

But then nearly 10 years after Pink Teddy was lost I was with my mother while she was taking my newborn baby brother to the child health clinic and what do you know Pink Teddy was in the nurse's office hanging off the scales, the nurse had been there all of those years and never lost hope that the owner would be found. It took 10 years but we were reunited that day. That was nearly 30 years ago now and Pink Teddy has been kept safe and sound ever since.''

New tip levy ... 

The Launceston City Council has backed a statewide waste levy of $10 a tonne that would raise about $1 million a year from its Remount Road tip. 

The levy would be passed on through higher tip charges in the hope it would reduce the 100,000 tonnes of landfill buried at the tip each year. 

Under the levy, fees for cars and single-axle trailers using the Launceston tip would rise by about $1.30 and $2.50 respectively. 

The council has already proposed a 4 per cent increase in its annual waste management charge for all ratepayers and increases in tip fees of between 8 and 12 per cent. 

And it comes as households face significant increases in power and water and sewerage charges.

DO YOU THINK AN INCREASE IN TIP FEES WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RUBBISH?",,status,,2012-06-12 20:19:52,1,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The ice cream truck was purchased by the St. Louis Police Foundation at a cost of $16,500. Prairie Farms donated more than 6,000 ice creams to be given away and Schnucks will give the police a discount on future purchases to continue the program. The truck will travel to different areas of the city to hand out ice cream. The idea for the program came from the Boston Police department who have run a similar program since 2007.

It was destroyed in the 1960s as part of efforts to redevelop the area. Busch Memorial Stadium was built nearby, and the block where Chinatown was centered became a parking garage and later an office building. In this photo from 1965, just before the area was leveled, the south leg of the Arch can be seen under construction in the background. The photo was taken looking east down an alley that no longer exists in the block bounded by Market, Walnut, Seventh and Eighth.

Let me assure you that we were not attempting to take sides or fan the flames of racial divisiveness. In fact, please note that the story does not take sides. It presents a fair, even-handed, unbiased telling of the details. 
So why did we write about it in the first place? Mr. Olander's letter spurred a response from Schnucks, debate among city leaders, and an order from the city council for the human rights commission to stop meeting with businesses. The letter, in other words, spurred debate and action. That's news. You may not like Mr. Olander's opinion, and you have every right to disagree with him, but it became news. And that's why we wrote the story. Would it have been better for us to simply ignore it? Our job is to shed light on interesting people, topics and debates in the area. That's what we were attemping to do. Thanks for reading.

More about this photo:
For many years Muny chorus members worked the entire season, not just one or two shows. That meant they started rehearsals before the first show opened, then performed at night and rehearsed their next show during the day.

Most of the 1942 female dancers are from the St. Louis area. From left, by row, they are: (first row) Mary Ann Hickey, Susan Scott, Eunice Kagan, Jean Haumueller, (second row) Rosemary Powell, Leonore Hines, Jane Bauer, Carol Ossman, (third row) Doris Jean Rathman, Virginia Hashagen, Lillian Cross,
Virginia Conrad, (fourth row) Lillian Ann Merod, Virginia Lee Green, Marie von Behren, Betty Herbert, (fifth row) Nancy McCabe, Jackie Bonder, Kay Eibert, Suzanne Schmitz, (last row) Mary Foster, Josephine McCann, Dortha Maie Wicker and Mary Jo Zucchero.

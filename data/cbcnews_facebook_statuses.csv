The bank, however, failed to facilitate the transfer before a one-year deadline, after which his wife's money could no longer be rolled over and was fully taxable.

As a result of CBC News inquiries, Scotiabank has now offered MacDonald $37,000 to cover his tax bill. He received the offer four business days after Go Public contacted Scotiabank in Toronto.

Lori Peters and her eight-year-old, Ethan, are joining his sisters at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa today as Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews announces a new life-saving screening for newborns in the province.

Ethan has Severe Combined Immune Deficiency or SCID, a group of rare and potentially fatal conditions in which the immune system either lacks key immune cells called T-lymphocytes or the cells don't work properly. 

It's also known as bubble boy disorder after David Vetter, a boy from Texas with a type of SCID, who lived for 12 years in a plastic, germ-free bubble.

Selwyn Pieters, a Toronto lawyer with considerable experience representing the families of people shot by police, told CBC News that while a charge of second-degree murder does leave the judge and jury with a number of options, including opting for a less charge, he thinks the charge should have been manslaughter.

""It's going to be a more difficult hurdle for the Crown to surmount if it's second degree,"" Pieters said. He described prosecuting this case as an ""Herculean task.""

On Tuesday, most senior military men in America apologized one after the other for the epidemic of sexual assaults and rapes that has taken place on their watch. 

It was a remarkable spectacle. And it landed with a thud. Some news outlets here did cover the hearing; most hardly bothered.

That's because this is not a story Americans want to hear. Not only does it run counter to the generally accepted view here that the U.S. military is a force for moral good, every one of its members a ""hero,"" but it contains nothing that can be used by partisans on the left or the right to bludgeon their political opponents.

By contrast, the Internal Revenue Service scandal is front-page news just about every day.

The extraordinarily stupid decision by a group of IRS bureaucrats to single out far-right political groups for special consideration may yet become the single most damaging story to hit the Obama administration.

Unlike the military story, the IRS scandal is most definitely a partisan bludgeon.

He goes on to explain, ""North Star of Herschel Island is a familiar sight to residents of Victoria, BC where she has made her home for the past forty years. What most don't know is that she is the last of her kind - a sailing cargo ship built for two Canadian Inuit in 1935 at the height of the Great Depression for use in transporting their winter's catch of fur to market in the high Arctic. During the Cold War she was used by the Federal Government to assert Canadian Arctic sovereignty and she was later chartered by them to survey the controversial B.C./Alaska boundary. In 1981 she was chartered by Cambridge University scientists to search for mermaids in the North Pacific and more recently she has been an International Canadian Good Will Ambassador in tall ships festivals. ""

""Most of all though she represents Inuit strength, resourcefulness and their history. The original owners provided fur to Buckingham Palace for their robes as well as to movie stars such as Greta Garbo, Marlena Dietrich and Canadian sweetheart, Mary Pickford. She is the only fully-rigged ship in Canada, has a rare copper bottom and often sailed with the R.C.M.P.'s St. Roch. Only in Canada would this ship not be a National Historic Site!""",CBC News's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/cbcnews/photos/a.10150640531594604.408171.5823419603/10151450751389604/?type=3,2013-02-26 09:21:29,53,2,13,53,0,0,0,0,0

All over Canada yesterday, gathered for a national day of protest against the federal government's Bill C-45 which they say violates their treaty rights.

Aboriginal spokespeople say it proposes significant changes to the Indian Act, including changes to land management on reserves that make it easier for the federal government to control reserve land.

The protests were well documented online, particularly on Twitter, where the #IdleNoMore hashtag was widely used for a lot of the day and into this morning.

APTN is reporting Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence held a news conference in Ottawa on Parliament Hill.  She announced she would begin a hunger strike today until the federal government calls a meeting between Minister Stephen Harper, Queen Elizabeth II and First Nations leaders.

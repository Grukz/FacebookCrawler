All you need is a heli-lift to the peak. | $1,600

These slippers put the stiff action and snow-feel of a 130-flex racing boot in an incredibly light packageâ€”an ideal mix of power and agility for ripping lines off-piste. With Atomic's Memory Fit tech, the ski shop can mold them to hug your feet like a comfy pair of socks. | $700

3. Pow Royal Gore-Tex Glove
Gloves this warm usually have the dexterity of a catcher's mitt, but these ski-Â­patrol favorites are different. Layers of Gore-Tex and ThinÂ­sulate inside keep the bulk down, while the goatskin-and-Â­nylon shell provides toughness and pliÂ­ancy. There's even a soft panel for wiping your runny nose. | $100

4. Giro Zone MIPS Helmet
Giro's sleek freeride helmet combines a hard-shell dome and lighter molded Â­materials below, giving you added protection without added weight. Use the rear dial to shape it snugly to your noggin. An easy-to-use slider lets you open or close air vents on the fly. Look cool, stay cool. | $200

5. Oakley Line Miner Goggle
Backcountry pow on a bluebird day? Oh yeah. But you better be able to see where you're going. The Line Miner's cylindrical profile delivers awesome peripheral vision, so you can carve that glade with confidence.

19440638720_10150498456363721,"Next time you forget your password when logging into a website, blame it on Bill Gates.

Eight years ago, Gates declared that the password would soon be gone, replaced by secure tokens or Smart Cards. That never happened. Gates' prediction happened before the rapid growth of web giants such as Amazon and Facebook, which allowed millions of users to sign-up, for free, using nothing more than a password.

Convential thinking says that the password should be complicated to thwart brute force attacks, where hackers slam combination after combination into the password field. But most web sites can  easily stop these by using a captcha or timing out after a handful of failed logins. So while we're wasting our time coming up with impossible-to-remember passwords, keyloggers and phishers are having a field day breaking into our Gmail and Facebook accounts.

Gates was wrong. The password isn't dead; it's flourishing. But we need internet security to catch up.

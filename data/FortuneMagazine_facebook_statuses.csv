56501027948_355117972948,"So with all the attention we've been heaping on Fortune.com lately, we've also been pretty busy over at Fortune the magazine.

The new-look Fortune represents the latest iteration of the deep-dive business magazine founded by Henry Luce 80 years ago. Regular readers will see that the changes we have made are substantial, yet evolutionary. We've kept the big Fortune stories -- check out this issue's look at army vets-turned-new business elite -- but we didn't ignore those who told us that they wanted as much information as possible about how to manage their careers in and outside of large companies. Thus, two new sections: Careers and Venture. 

We're also very proud to introduce a bold opinion section featuring several new columnists, including CNBC Squawk Box anchor and former Wall Street Journal reporter Becky Quick, who will opine on all manner of business subjects from her position of unusual access.

And on top of all of these new features, we think you'll find that Fortune's commitment to the highest-quality, long-form narrative storytelling is stronger than ever. That truly is the heart and soul of our magazine, and it is where readers say we continue to add the most value. So without further ado, here's a preview of what you'll find in the latest issue. 

Enjoy!

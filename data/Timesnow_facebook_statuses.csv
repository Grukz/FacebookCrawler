Gitanjali Babbar is working for the welfare of commercial sex workers in Delhi's GB Road and is determined to give these shunned women and their children a new life. She formed the organization 'Kat Katha' to help them dream, learn and discover a life beyond the red light area. 

'Kat Katha' was set up after Gitanjali spent 2 years in understanding the problems these women face. The organization uses the practice of community participation and encourages these women to learn different arts like stitching, embroidery and painting. Gitanjali's hard work has instilled confidence in these women that they are not alone.

Udo and Wilma Gastel came to India from Switzerland in 2005 and they were moved to see the plight of families affected by the tsunami. After helping the victims, they decided to sponsor the education of 70 underprivileged children from the villages of Tamil Nadu. They established the 'You and We' trust back in Switzerland with the aim to improve the lives of the downtrodden in India. They made India their second home.

Wilma Gastel believes, ""We give the children a chance to study, we hope we can change their life"". They are also closely associated with the Satya Special School. It is a centre which provides therapy and vocational training to disabled children. Wilma and Udo Gastel are truly Indians at heart, who continue to work selflessly for these children.

Plano East sophomore third baseman Olivia Rosen suffered a broken nose when she was struck by a line drive in a February game. She wore a mask when she was younger but stopped because the perception was ""You only wore it if you were scared."" Her father has already bought her a new mask for when she returns and said he will make sure she wears it.

Softball face masks are a growing trend at Dallas-area high schools. At Richardson ISD -- which has had players suffer a broken nose, severe forehead contusion and have an ear torn partially off -- it's mandatory for all third basemen to wear a mask in practice and games.

-- Doctors said they expect the 3 in critical condition to survive.
-- Army Secretary John McHugh says Lopez was deployed for the final months of the Iraq war but did not see combat.
-- Lopez was not wounded in action while serving overseas, but self-reported a traumatic brain injury upon his return to the U.S. 
-- Lopez appeared to have no connections to extremist groups.
-- McHugh says Lopez had been prescribed Ambien to deal with a sleeping problem and had several mental health issues. Lopez was examined by a psychiatrist last month and was found to show no violent or suicidal tendencies.

He was convicted of killing his two young daughters in 2001 at his Deep Ellum loft while his ex-wife listened on the phone. Battaglia has been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, in addition to bipolar. Narcissism is characterized by exploitive behavior, an oversized sense of self-importance, and a lack of empathy. 

Battaglia told reporter Sarah he believes he was set up. He blames the D.A., the judge handling his trial, and The Dallas Morning News for his conviction. Narcissists also tend to view themselves as victims, experts say.

If you're not familiar with the term, our Michael Lindenberger, who's in D.C. reporting on the ruling, explains it like this:
-- Companies like AT&T will now be allowed to narrow the bandwidth for, say, a movie-streaming site like Netflix, while giving more capacity to a Netflix rival. The ability to discriminate gives AT&T, Verizon and other internet providers the opportunity to charge fees to firms who want to be able to offer faster experiences to their customers.
-- Net neutrality advocates (those who argue that internet providers should not be allowed to play favorites) argue that providers will now only open powerful, faster bandwidth capacities to firms that are willing to pay for it. That would push out startups or smaller rivals who can't afford it.

Nixon was staying at the old Baker Hotel (as was actress Joan Crawford on an unrelated Big D visit). Kennedy stayed in Suite 850 at the Hotel Texas in Fort Worth.

The fertilizer's explosive nature has led to similar prohibitions in China, Colombia, Germany, Ireland and the Philippines. But in the U.S., you can purchase it pure by the ton. Then you can store it in a wooden warehouse with no sprinkler system, a few hundred feet from a middle school.

For more than a decade, U.S. efforts to tighten controls over ammonium nitrate fertilizer have repeatedly failed, bogged down by bureaucratic gridlock and industry resistance. Regulations approved years ago remain unenforced and unfinished. Mere talk of safer substitutes has been blocked by those with profits at stake.

It began with the approach of Juneteenth, the anniversary of the day Texas slaves learned they'd been freed. We retraced Bruce's journey from the scene of the crime, to the square where a sheriff and armed residents held off a lynch mob, to the courthouse where his trial occurred and to the jail where he was held while the scaffolding for his hanging was being built.

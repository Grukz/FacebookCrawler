That means almost 230,000 sanctions might be illegal. That's incompetence on an industrial scale.

Now we believe that government should have a general power to issue sanctions - but we also profoundly believe than Ministers have a duty to bring forward back to work schemes that actually work.""

Demand for firearms, ammunition and bulletproof gear has surged since the Dec. 14 massacre in Newtown, Conn., that took the lives of 20 schoolchildren and six teachers and administrators. The shooting sparked calls for tighter gun control measures, especially for military-style assault weapons like the ones used in Newtown and in the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting earlier this year. The prospect of a possible weapons ban has sent gun enthusiasts into a panic and sparked a frenzy of buying at stores and gun dealers nationwide.

By Brad Linzy, Freelance writer, self-professed libertarian and active member of the Republican Party

'The fallacy in many gun control arguments lies in the assumption that laws magically create the conditions they intend to create. It is far more common that more laws and regulations against something only create an unintended black market for the object of the ban or regulation. Just as criminalization of marijuana or heroin has not stopped their use or proliferation, criminalization of gun ownership will not stop gun use or the proliferation or firearms. The only people it will routinely disarm are the law abiding. This underscores the other main fallacy of anti-gun arguments, which is that criminals, particularly of the type that premeditate mass killings, have any interest in laws.

In my State of Indiana and many other States, law-abiding citizens are allowed to apply for a license to carry a concealed weapon. The application assures that you are not mentally handicapped, unstable, or have a criminal record. I carry such a weapon, not out of fear, but because as a father and husband, I feel a personal responsibility to provide as much security as I can for my family. If we ever had the grave misfortune of finding ourselves in a public place where a shooter decides to attack innocent people, I will have the means to return fire and protect my family and the other innocent people around me. Police cannot be everywhere and they have a poor record of stopping mass shootings by themselves.'

""In every country, some people lose their jobs and become enraged. Some suffer mental illness and seize on fantastical notions. They are spurned and hatch crackpot schemes and seek revenge. In every country, some people are disturbed, broken-hearted or angry enough to murder. What is special about this country is the extent of the damage that such people are able to inflict when the urge comes.

As we inevitably speculate and sift through biographical facts in this process of seeking reassurance, there is one fact above all others that needs to be altered: We have to make it harder for people to get their hands on guns.""

'David Cameron's backing of gay marriage was meant to be an easy way to cement the detoxification of the Tory brand. However the most striking memory of debate is more likely to be a Tory MP claiming that he couldn't possibly be a bigot because he once punched a gay man in the face.

Culture secretary Maria Miller's encounter with Tory MPs on Monday and Tuesday saw Conservatives line up not only to attack the plan, but compare gay marriage to polygamy and dismiss it as not ""normal"". One suggested that straight couples would be more likely to have babies out of wedlock if gay people were allowed to tie the knot - because, presumably, the very institution of marriage would then have gay germs on it.

Same-sex marriage was described by one Conservative as ""a constitutional outrage and a disgrace"", another was ""deeply offended"", his colleague said plans for equal marriage smacked of ""arrogance and intolerance"" and another was concerned ""this country will be passing a law that is directly contrary to what Jesus said""'.

He admitted illegally possessing a Glock 9mm pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition at a court martial. After hearing arguments, three judges - Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, Mr Justice Fulford and Mr Justice Bean - said Sgt Nightingale's sentence would be cut from 18 months to 12 months and suspended.

A court in Haifa has ruled that the death of Rachel Corrie, who was crushed by a bulldozer as she stood protesting against the demolition of Palestinian houses in Rafah in 2003, was not the fault of either the state of Israel or the army.

The driver of the bulldozer that crushed Corrie was also cleared of any wrongdoing.

Was the death of the 23-year-old, as the court ruled, simply part of ""combatant activities"", or should the state of Israel and the army have taken responsibility for her death?

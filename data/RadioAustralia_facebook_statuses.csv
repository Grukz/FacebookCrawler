The CEO of Angau, Dr Christopher Kenyhercz told Pacific Beat this week that the media's coverage of the situation at the centre was mostly negative and unhelpful, and time would be better spent spreading awareness on how to recognise cancer symptoms early.

EMTV Journalist Scott Waide, who is based in Lae, says he agrees with Dr Kenyhercz that there are not enough messages on cancer prevention in PNG.

But he says the stories of the people suffering from cancer still need to be heard.

With research from the World Resources Institute showing that all coral reefs could be under threat by 2050, one proposal is suggesting conservationists focus their efforts on the reefs least likely to die.

The 50 Reefs project aims to bring scientists together to identify the 50 reefs around the world that are the least vulnerable to climate change.

It's hoped that by doing this, those areas can then be properly protected and will one day replenish the reefs that have died off.

It's an initiative by The Ocean Agency, a not-for-profit organisation focused on communicating the need for ocean conservation.

Former Fiji sevens coach Ben Ryan is a national hero after leading the team to Olympic glory, but he believes if the team is to achieve even more, then it needs to be set up as stand alone franchise, separate from the FRU. However the word is the FRU is not about to relinquish control. 

Now Cook Islands have terminated the contract of Stan Wright, their former captain who took the reins as national coach less than a year ago. 

Already he had established a fixture list for the national team unlike anything they've had before, with a tour to the Americas coming up in June, and he was building a list of new players who're keen to play for the islands, but he also wanted to see changes in the way the CIRU runs the game, and that's where he hit a wall.

The shortwave transmissions to Asia and the Pacific will cease from January 31st next year, as alternatives such as FM and internet become more prevalent.

Former head of Radio Australia and subsequently a consultant on international broadcasting in the Pacific, Jean Gabriel Manguy, tells Bruce Hill the decision is short sighted.

An ABC statement says the move is in line with the broadcaster's commitment to expand its digital content offerings.

It says Radio Australia's audiences in the Pacific will to be able to listen to FM broadcasts and online and the savings are to be reinvested in a more robust FM transmitter network and increased regional content.

The move will save an estimated $2.8 million dollars a year and one of Australia's most senior diplomats in the region, James Batley, has called for this money to be re-invested into media and journalism across the Pacific

Mr Batley is a former Australian High Commissioner to both Fiji and Solomon Islands and he led RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands from 2004 to 2006.

He says it will be a pity to lose Radio Australia's shortwave transmission, but it's a move that reflects broader changes in the media landscape.

""I've had lots and lots of rewarding and interesting experiences teaching. One of the kindergartens I worked at in Hanoi would play Ricky Martin's 'The Cup of Life' at full volume and have all the children dance to it with cheerleader style pom poms -- it never failed to make me smile.

""Since moving away from Australia, things that seemed so important back home now feel trivial. It's a cliche, but moving overseas broadens your outlook and gives you a whole new set of skills. I've become more confident and feel like I can do things I never would have thought before. I'm now a lot better at driving a motorbike through crazy traffic! Before moving to South East Asia, I wish I'd have known it was so difficult to buy clothes if you're over 6 foot!

""Missing friends and family, and the general madness of both Hanoi and Phnom Penh can get to you sometimes. But I do know that if I were ever to leave that I will miss meeting new, like minded people and being able to travel very easily.""

Judy (the woman in the photo) had been trying to find them after they helped her climb the Great Wall of China, together with her carer (the man in the blue and black jacket). They carried her with her wheelchair all the way up, waited for her to finish, and carried her back down.

Judy knew nothing about the men - not even their names - but had always wanted to say thank you for helping her achieve a lifelong dream.

It's been exactly five years since this photo was taken, and thanks to these Facebook posts, we managed to track down these men! They are Dr Charles Su, Dr Kimberley Tan and Dr Thomas Hardy (pictured from right) and they're all opthamologists, who were in China for a work conference.

Dr Kimberley Tan says ""it was a pleasure to help another human being, but anyone would have done the same thing.""

In 2004, he ruthlessly pursued Liberal preselection for the seat of Wentworth, where he had lived his whole life, against sitting member Peter King. He entered Parliament for John Howard's final term in office.
He rose to become leader of the Liberal Party in opposition, before losing a challenge by one vote to Tony Abbott.

That's the confident prediction of John Momis, President of the Autonomous Bougainville Government.

The island was the scene of a bloody and prolonged civil war over the profits from the Panguna Copper and gold mine in the 1990s, but a peace agreement formally ended the conflict in 2001 by promising a referendum on independence, which is scheduled for 2019.

President John Momis says as PNG celebrates 40 years of independence, Bougainvilleans don't feel they're part of the country.

It is with great sadness that we inform you of the passing of our friend and colleague Pierre Riant, who was the Executive Producer of our French service. 

Pierre passed away in Melbourne late on Friday evening, following a battle with cancer.  

Pierre started working for Radio Australia in 1983. He was a dedicated journalist and believed in the role that RA plays as an international public broadcaster. He was committed to serving the French Pacific and was dedicated to ensuring citizens across the region had access to important news and information that impacted their daily lives. He was inventive and creative, always looking at new ways to improve the delivery of valuable content. He was a wonderful colleague and nurtured the development of other staff here at Radio Australia, in particular Caroline Lafargue.

We received SMS responses from PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu that indicated people are passionately aware of the importance of water to life. The responses also indicated that without water, there's no life.
...
When I was a boy growing up, long before plastic bottles and buckets, my folks used to carry and store water from wells and underground water dripping out of limestone, in long bamboo trunks. Water stored in this way was always refreshingly cool.

For my family and I, we have simple rules in the house about shorter showers, no running tap when brushing teeth, running grey water tubes from the washing machine to the lawn and veggie garden.

It's important to think that, one doesn't put up rules like these because there are water restrictions in Melbourne but rather because we know ourselves that water is important to life and as listeners told us last night, no water no life.""",Australia Plus Pacific,photo,https://www.facebook.com/AustraliaPlusPacific/photos/a.312457015437838.96285.256836760999864/413338882016317/?type=3,2012-03-22 01:03:44,8,2,1,8,0,0,0,0,0

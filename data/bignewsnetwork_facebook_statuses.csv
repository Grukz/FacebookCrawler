109808052412959_1142832229110531,"ANKARA, Turkey - It is now confirmed 265 people have died in the #TurkeyCoupAttempt on Friday night, while 1,440 were injured.

Most of the dead were civilians however a large number of police officers were also among the 161 people killed by those engineering the coup, according to Turkish officials. Another 104 people who were involved in the coup or who were supporting it lost their lives. 
 
President #TayyipErdogan has come down heavily on the coup plotters, taking drastic measures to shore up his power. 

2,839 #TurkishMilitary personnel including generals and other officers, and rank-and-file soldiers have been arrested. Over three hundred of them surrendered to authorities on Saturday. All were handcuffed and stripped from the waist upwards. Police stations in many cases were unable to accommodate the high number of arrests so suspects were taken to sports stadiums to be processed.

A request has been made to the #GreekGovernment to extradite 8 soldiers who defected early Saturday to #Greece by helicopter.

About 2,700 judges have been sacked. Ten members of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors and 2 members of the Constitutional Court have been detained, officials said. 

Turkey's chief-of-staff, who had been taken hostage, has been rescued. Some military commanders who had been taken hostage however have yet to be accounted for.

Thousands of government supporters took to the streets again on Saturday night in Ankara, Istanbul and other major cities throughout #Turkey to protest the coup. Civilians turned out in droves during the attempted coup on Friday night and are widely credited with helping to thwart the attempted government overthrowing.

Erdogan on Saturday pledged to purge the #TurkishArmy, describing the coup attempt as a ""gift from God.""

""They will pay a heavy price for this,"" he told reporters. ""This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/1142832229110531/?type=3,2016-07-16 20:57:46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_1133249770068777,"SYDNEY, Australia - News Corp political commentator Andrew Bolt has launched a stinging attack against Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in the wake of Saturday's national poll which has brought the Turnbull government to the brink of losing government.

While the result of the election will not be known for some days, it is likely Mr Turnbull's Coalition will retain government, but by the slimmest of margins. 

Bolt pulled no punches on Sunday when he called on the prime minister to resign. He even proposed that Tony Abbott should be reinstated to the leadership. In a strong rebuke Mr Bolt took issue with the prime minister on a range of fronts:

""You assassinated a Liberal Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, who'd won an election by a huge margin,"" he wrote in News Corp's Sunday newspapers which include the Sunday Telegraph, the Herald Sun, The Advertiser and The Courier Mail.

""You promised to do even better than him. You then treated the Liberal base like dirt, smashing it with a huge super tax, refusing to speak to conservative journalists, repeatedly humiliating Abbott. You referred to the colonial settlement of Australia as an ""invasion"" and even held an end-of-Ramadan meal with known Muslim bigots. You called an early double dissolution election on the excuse of needing new laws to tackle rogue unions with a building and construction commission, but with the true aim of getting rid of crossbench oppositionists in the Senate. You went to the election with basically only one policy to sell, a pathetic 10-year promise to cut company tax.""

""And now look. Almost everything turned to ruin,"" claimed the veteran journalist who is a regular writer for Rupert Murdoch's Australian Newspapers and is host of the nightly Bolt Report on Sky News, while also regularly appearing on Radio 2GB and 3AW.

""You have lost so many seats that you could even be forced into minority government, if pre-polling and Western Australia go against you,"" Mr Bolt continued.

""You have, if anything, lost ground in the Senate, which will block most of your plans.""

""You will be unable to get the numbers to get your building and construction commission through in any joint sitting of parliament,"" wrote Bolt.

""You have asked for no mandate for real reform, and will have almost no power to undertake any.""

""Your popularity, already plummeting, will fall further,"" the journalist predicted

""There is no way you can seriously claim that this result is better than anything Abbott could have achieved.""

Mr Bolt pointed out that Tony Abbott picked up seven seats at the 2010 election and another 15 in the 2013 election, whereas Mr Turnbull has .lost between 10 and 15 seats.

""You have been a disaster,"" says Bolt. ""You betrayed Tony Abbott and then led the party to humiliation, stripped of both values and honour.""

""Resign,"" he demanded.

The Australian political commentator conceded Turnbull was likely to retain government, ""but by a disastrously small margin,"" that will leave it ""powerless,"" and Mr Turnbull, ""humiliated"" and ""the country damned.""

Mr Bolt said the Turnbull government is possibly facing a hung parliament, or could cling to power by a seat or two. 

He points out the Senate which will be dominated by Labor, the Greens, up to 3 Nick Xenophon senators and probably Pauline Hanson will make life extremely difficult.

""For Turnbull, this will be almost as devastating as losing the election, he will be PM with almost no authority, no mandate and no popularity,"" said Mr Bolt. ""He will rely on deals with crossbenchers in the Senate and possibly even in the House of Representatives to get anything through Parliament. His promised spending cuts will be largely blocked. So will some of his corporate tax.""

The veteran commentator didn't leave it there. ""Turnbull's agenda will be shredded and his personal popularity, already in free fall, will now fall further. Within the Liberals, Turnbull will be toast. He has proved not to be the saviour  the vote magnet  he promised when he knifed Abbott last September,"" he said.

""He outraged party loyalists by his treachery, and then rubbed it in by spruiking policies of the Left  a huge tax hit on super savings, big spending and extra taxes. He championed same-sex marriage, called the settlement of Australia an ""invasion"", and stupidly held an end-of-Ramadan meal in the middle of the election with Muslims who included unrepentant hate-preachers.""

""Turnbull never had the love of the party. Having now assassinated a Liberal leader and then sold out its principles to win this miserable and squalid half-victory, he will now be the target of furious criticism. Even the very excuse Turnbull gave for this early, double dissolution election has blown up in his face,"" exclaimed Bolt

""He will not have the numbers in any joint sitting of parliament to get through his bill to bring back the Australian Building and Construction Commission, needed to tame militant building unions.""

""Nor will he have cleaned out the Senate of those pesky crossbenchers who held the government to ransom for three years. If anything, there could be even more crossbenchers,"" wrote Bolt in the Sunday Telegraph

"".... I'm tipping, after a few months  maybe a couple of years  there will be no Turnbull. He will probably be driven off, unloved and unmourned even by the Liberals who so stupidly greeted him as the Messiah just nine months ago,"" wrote Bolt.

""He will be brought down as he brought down Abbott, who kept his counsel during this long campaign and can now say: ""I told you so.""

Mr Bolt first made his views known on Sky News during the coverage of the election aftermath on Saturday night. ""This is a disgrace, for what he's done to Tony Abbott. This is all he's got left? The man should resign,"" he thundered.

""He's got no authority within the party. He's trashed the brand, he's got no mandate for change. You think the Liberals will just say that's fine? This is just a disgrace, it is absolutely a disgrace.""

Peta Credlin, Mr Abbott's former Chief-of-staff who shared a panel with Bolt, did not concur with Bolt but did indicate she believed Abbott would have fared better. ""I would have backed him in this time round. Because he knows how to campaign, he resonates in those regional seats, he resonates in western Sydney, and in the places where Labor has made ground tonight,"" she said of her former boss.

""But you'll never know because he's not in the race.""

""One thing that can be said is no-one can blame this result on Tony Abbott, who played I think a very fair, a very dignified team game,"" Credlin added.

Cabinet Secretary Arthur Sinodinos, who played a major part in the elevation of Turnbull to the leadership didn't agree. ""At this stage I have to say anybody in the Liberal Party who thinks they faced a better future under different circumstances is not living in the same planet as the rest of us were last year,"" he said during Channel Nine's election coverage.

""That is the reality and we spent 9 months clawing back, trying to get the trust of the Australian people after some of the events of the early part of the term. That is the truth.""

Treasurer Scott Morrisson, who also appeared on the Nine Network was asked whether he thought Mr Abbott would have done better.  ""I think it's highly unlikely. I think the party room made its own judgement on that last September,"" he replied.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/1133249770068777/?type=3,2016-07-02 14:26:45,6,2,1,6,0,0,0,0,0

DHAKA, Bangladesh - Government officials have now disclosed twenty hostages were killed in the overnight siege in the capital.

It is now known 33 hostages were taken by several gunmen shortly after 9pm local time Friday night. The hostages killed were all civilians. At least two police officers also died in the attack. At least six of the attackers were also killed, while 1 was captured alive.

Scores of commandos stormed the venue to rescue the hostages at around 8am Saturday morning. 

The outcome of the rescue was clouded by a media blackout imposed by Bangladeshi authorities. 

Undoubtedly security forces have been gathering the facts on the ground since their rescue attempt to assemble an accurate picture of what occurred before releasing it to the media.

At a press conference Saturday afternoon the grim news was revealed. Until that time it was understood 20 hostages had been taken, however the accurate number after identifying and classifying those rescued and bodies discovered inside the cafe, has been upgraded to 33.

The news that followed was even grimmer. While the rescue of 13 hostages had been known, the upgrade in the number of hostages means 20 of those had died in the attack. Officials confirmed this at the news conference and also revealed the victims had been hacked to death with blunt objects.

""It was an extremely heinous act,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in a televised statement. ""What kind of Muslims are these people? They don't have any religion.""

""My government is determined to root out terrorism and militancy from Bangladesh.""

Police and the RAB (Rapid Action Battalion) co-operated in managing the crisis.

Two explosions at the cafe since the commando raid occurred were believed to be part of a clearing operation by security forces to diffuse or detonate bombs and booby traps.

""Our commandos have stormed into the restaurant. Intense gunfighting on,"" Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan, a deputy director at the RAB force, told Reuters shortly after 8am local time Saturday.

The drama unfolded just after 9pm local time on Friday night when gunmen stormed a restaurant/cafe frequented by foreigners in the diplomatic area in the heart of Dhaka.

A worker at the restaurant, the Holey Artisan Bakery cafe which opened just two years ago in June 2014, said six to 8 gunmen attacked the eatery which is popular among locals. Up to twenty people he believed had been taken hostage. The cafe worker said he managed to escape during the confusion. 

In Italy, State TV RAI reported seven of the hostages were Italian businessmen. Italian ambassador in Dhaka, Mario Palma, told the channel an eighth Italian businessman escaped and alerted the embassy to the plight of the others.

Police and security forces surrounded the cafe. A gunfight erupted between the hostage-takers and law enforcement early on after the siege began. The attackers are believed to have thrown grenades during the battle. Two police officers are confirmed dead while 40 people were wounded in that battle. Following the gunfight, the situation quietened down. The hostage takers are believed to have refused to negotiate and did not make any demands.

""We want to resolve this peacefully. We are trying to talk to the attackers,"" Benazir Ahmed, chief of Bangladesh's RAB (Rapid Action Battalion), said Friday night. ""Some of our people have been injured. Our first priority is to save the lives of the people trapped inside,"" he said.

A late report said ISIS had claimed responsibility for the attack, however there is no confirmation of that and officials are skeptical as to the authenticity of the report.

Islamic State last month was accused of trying to ride a wave of religious radicalization by falsely claiming a spate of killings in Bangladesh, a government minister told Reuters in an interview in May, adding there was enough evidence implicating domestic militant groups.

Analysts say that as Islamic State loses territory in Iraq and Syria and its finances get drained, it may be trying to build affiliates in countries such as Libya, Egypt and Bangladesh for jihadists to launch attacks locally and cheaply.

But Shahriar Alam, Bangladesh's state minister for foreign affairs, told Reuters no local or foreign agency had found any presence of Islamic State in the country.

The U.S. State Department said Friday it believed al-Qaeda would more likely have carried out the attack.

The U.S. embassy in Dhaka has issued a warning to U.S. citizens to take shelter and follow instructions of local authorities. ""There has been a shooting and hostage situation reported at Holey Bakery in Gulshan 2, Dhaka. Please shelter in place and monitor all news sources for further developments,"" the U.S. embassy statement published late Friday night said. Separately John Kirby at the State Department advised all Americans working at the embassy, who were planning to celebrate the Independence Day weekend, have all been accounted for. Kirby told a press briefing the situation was ""very fluid, very live.""

Separately on Friday at a temple in Jhinaidah district, 188 miles (300 kilometres) southwest of Dhaka, a Hindu priest was hacked to death.

109808052412959_1132817220112032,"Disappointing report from Middle East Quartet:
#MiddleEast #Israel #Palestinians #MiddleEastConflict #MiddleEastQuartet #Palestine #UnitedNations

NEW YORK, New York (Big News Network Op-ed) - After four months of study the so-called Middle East Quartet has produced a damp squib report which imparts nothing new and makes recommendations which will achieve nothing.

Released on Friday at the end of the week's news cycle, ensuring little coverage, the report would have battled to derive any prominence in any event.

Lauding the report as the first of its kind, the Quartet comprising the UN, Russia, the United States and the EU have avoided offending either Israel or the Palestinian Authority, have left out any information that realistically sums up the status of the conflict, and has failed to set out any structure or timeline to achieve anything of constructive value. There are no stunning revelations, in fact the report largely reiterates what has been said in the past. As far as new ideas or initiatives being put forward are concerned, there arn't any. 

The very thin, 8-page report is unlikely to advance the two-state solution or to lead to any negotiations that will result in any resolution to the ongoing issues in the troubled area.

The UN Quartet has been in existence for fourteen years during which time the so-called peace process has gone backwards. Its effectiveness as a mediation or negotiation mechanism can only be likened to the negotiation and mediation skills of the United States which has spent several decades trying, or giving the impression it has been trying, to broker a peace deal to no avail.

""The Quartet has little to show for its (more than) decade-long involvement in the peace process. ... Having spent most of the last 3 years in a state of near paralysis, and having failed to dissuade the Palestinians from seeking UN membership and recognition in September 2011, the Quartet has finally reached the limits of its utility. The current mechanism is too outdated, dysfunctional, and discredited to be reformed. Instead of undertaking another vain attempt to 'reactivate' the Quartet, the United States, the European Union, United Nations, and Russia should simply allow the existing mechanism to go quietly into the night,"" The Center for Middle East Policy said, and that was more than four years ago (February 2012). 

The Quartet began working on the report in February. The UN Security Council was briefed on its contents on Thursday, with selective components of it released to the media and published by selective parties.

Despite the moot nature of the contents of the report, Israel and the Palestinian Authority both took issue with it. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the report equates the Occupied with the Occupying power. ""It doesn't meet our expectations as a nation living under a foreign colonial military occupation,"" he said Friday.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, in a statement released Friday said the report includes numerous factual and policy assertions with which it would take issue.

In the report, the Quartet called on each side to ""independently demonstrate, through policies and actions, a genuine commitment to the two-state solution"" and to ""refrain from unilateral steps that prejudice the outcome of the final negotiations.""

In summary, the Quartet reiterated that a negotiated two-state outcome is the only way to achieve an enduring peace that meets Israeli security needs and Palestinian aspirations for statehood and sovereignty, ends the occupation that began in 1967, and resolves all permanent status issues.

The report provides recommendations to what the Quartet says it has identified as the major threats to achieving a negotiated peace: continued violence, terrorist attacks against civilians and incitement to violence; settlement construction and expansion; and the Palestinian Authority's lack of control in Gaza.

In a statement, the Quartet Principals invited the Israeli and Palestinian governments to engage with it on implementing its recommendations and creating conditions to resume ""meaningful negotiations that resolve all final status issues.""

Following the release of the report, the UN Secretary-General encouraged the parties to engage with the Quartet to implement the findings ""to rebuild hope among Palestinians and Israelis in a political solution and to create the conditions to return to meaningful negotiations.""

He underscored that there is a strong need for affirmative steps to reverse negative trends on the ground which risk entrenching a one-State reality of ""perpetual occupation and conflict"" which is incompatible with the national aspirations of both peoples.

The Quartet's recommendations in the report, which are purely reiterations of recommendations made in the past, are detailed as follows:

    ""Both sides should work to de-escalate tensions by exercising restraint and refraining from provocative actions and rhetoric.""

    ""The Palestinian Authority should act decisively and take all steps within its capacity to cease incitement to violence and strengthen ongoing efforts to combat terrorism, including by clearly condemning all acts of terrorism.""

    ""Israel should cease the policy of settlement construction and expansion, designating land for exclusive Israeli use, and denying Palestinian development.""

    ""Israel should implement positive and significant policy shifts, including transferring powers and responsibilities in Area C, consistent with the transition to greater Palestinian civil authority contemplated by prior agreements. Progress in the areas of housing, water, energy, communications, agriculture, and natural resources, along with significantly easing Palestinian movement restrictions, can be made while respecting Israel's legitimate security needs.""

    ""The Palestinian leadership should continue their efforts to strengthen institutions, improve governance, and develop a sustainable economy. Israel should take all necessary steps to enable this process, in line with the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee recommendations.""

    ""All sides must continue to respect the ceasefire in Gaza, and the illicit arms buildup and militant activities must be terminated.""

In addition to these recommendations, the Quartet encouraged the international community to accelerate its efforts to address the ""dire"" humanitarian, reconstruction and recovery needs of the people in Gaza, including expediting the disbursement of assistance pledges.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/1132817220112032/?type=3,2016-07-01 19:55:37,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0

#DhakaAttack  #Dhaka  #Bangladesh

DHAKA, Bangladesh - A siege on an upscale cafe in Dhaka is believed to be over with 13 hostages having survived. 

Scores of commandos stormed the venue to rescue hostages held for almost a dozen hours since around 9pm local time on Friday night. 

The outcome of the rescue was clouded by a media blackout by Bangladeshi authorities. A Bangladeshi army source however has since revealed six gunmen have been killed, and 1 was captured.

At a press conference some hours after the siege ended the Bangladesh government revealed some horrible news. Throughout the 14-hour ordeal it was understood 20 hostages had been taken. The government revealed 33 in fact had been seized. Of these twenty were hacked to death. 13 survived.

Police and the RAB (Rapid Action Battalion) co-operated in managing the crisis. At least two police officers lost their lives, and many more were wounded.

The fire which tore through The Address Downtown Dubai, a luxury 5 star hotel and residential apartments complex, preceded the spectacular fire works emanating from the world's tallest tower, Burj Khalifa, just metres away.

The building, constructed at a cost of AED 845 million (United Arab Dirhams) or USD 230 million was completed in April 2008, adjoins the Dubai Mall, the city's largest shopping mall.

On Thursday night fire swept through the building, emanating from the 20th floor. It is understood the blaze was well entrenched before fire alarms began sounding. The building was evacuated according to Dubai Civil Defence authorities.

""There are more than 60 people injured with light injuries from smoke inhalation and from crowding while in the stairs evacuating the building,"" a medic was quoted by Reuters Thomson as saying.

The fire began around 9:30pm local time Thursday night. It was extinguished by scores of firefighters prior to midnight.

The Dubai Waterfront was evacuated, with many people being herded into the adjacent Dubai Mall where hundreds of thousands of people had gathered for shopping and the imminent New Year's Eve fireworks display.

""It's raging,"" Mohammed Al Sarraf, a visiting Kuwaiti businessman told The National newspaper. ""It's got so much bigger in five minutes. It's gone from just a small fire at the foot of the building and now it's shooting up the middle and the top. It's getting out of hand.""

""People are gathering and they are watching it and they are in shock,"" he added.

Ahmad Al Bader, a restaurateur said: ""I saw the flames just as it started and now it is out of hand. I can't see anything because of the smoke,"" Mr Al Bader said. ""They evacuated people in The Address. My uncle and aunt were having dinner there and they were quickly rushed out.""

""It started off very small. I thought it was a barbecue on a balcony or something and within four minutes it spread.""

Dubai's Chief of Police Maj Gen Khamis Al Muzeina told media police officers were ensuring there was none trapped in the burning building.

The Address Dubai Mall comprises 196 hotel rooms and 626 residential apartments, many of which are included in the hotel pool. The entire building is now empty, with guests and residents having been relocated.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/1016460325081056/?type=3,2015-12-31 22:13:52,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Winners include Salma bint Hizab al-Oteibi in the Mecca province; Lama al-Suleiman and Rasha Hufaithi in Jeddah; Hanouf al-Hazimi in the Al Jouf; and Sanaa al-Hammam and Masoumah Abdelreda in Ahsa, CNN reports. About 130,000 women registered to vote for Saturday's election, compared to 1.35 million men. At least 978 women registered as candidates, compared to 5,938 men.

Women had difficulty proving identities and residencies, according to Human Rights Watch. There were also a limited number of registration centers. Female candidates were also banned from speaking to male voters and campaign offices had to be segregated. The election was the third time in history that that Saudis have gone to the polls.

109808052412959_1002473716479717,"NEW YORK, New York - Nearly half of America's Christians (44 percent) believe the Jewish people are God's ""chosen people,"" according to a survey conducted by Shibley Telhami and published by the Brookings Institute.

The results of the study, conducted from November 4 to 10 2015, were released on Friday.

More than three-quarters of Americans indicated that they take into consideration when voting for candidates in elections, the candidate's position on Israel. More than a quarter of the population say their consideration on this issue is ""a lot.""

46% of Americans have an unfavourable view of Muslims, while 61% have an unfavourable view of Islam.

Other key findings included:

In the open ended question, ""Please name a national or world leader you admire most?"" Benjamin Netanyahu was most frequently mentioned among Evangelical Christians (16%) ahead of Ronald Reagan (11%) and Barack Obama (10%). Among Republicans, Netanyahu ties Ronald Reagan (12%), but only one percent of Democrats select Netanyahu as most admired leader.

In general, older Americans admire the Israeli leader far more than the younger ones.

Twenty nine percent of Americans say they are very concerned about events in Israel and the Palestinian territories and an additional 38% say they are somewhat concerned. 

Who do they believe is most responsible for the escalation of violence? A plurality, 31%, believe that the absence of serious peace diplomacy is most responsible, while 26% equally blame continued Israeli occupation and settlement, expansion in the West Bank, and Palestinian extremists. Only 6% each blame Israeli extremists and Palestinian authority ineffectiveness. 

The survey was conducted November 4 to 10, 2015, with a panel consisting of a probability-based representative sample. The panel was recruited by Nielsen Scarborough from its larger probability-based national panel, which was recruited by mail and telephone using a random sample of households provided by Survey Sampling International.

""A total of 1738 panelists completed the survey including a national sample of 875 adults, plus an oversample of 863 self-identified Evangelical or Born-again Christians, making for a total sample of Evangelicals/born-again Christians of 1074,"" the Brookings Institute said. ""Responses were weighted by age, gender, income, education, race, and geographic region using benchmarks from the U.S. Census. The survey was also weighted by partisan identification and Evangelical and Born-again Christians were down-weighted consistent with these groups' incidence rate in Nielsen Sacrborpugh sample, so that they represented 24 percent of the national sample for this study (211 of 875).""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/1002473716479717/?type=3,2015-12-05 01:57:26,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_999854220075000,"JERUSALEM, Israel - Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon said on Sunday that a Russian jet recently breached Israel's airspace without incident.

Ya'alon, who made the comments during an interview with Israel Radio, said that the aircraft entered the airspace above northern Israel from Syria, apparently by accident, Xinhua reported.

""There was a slight intrusion about 1.5-km deep (into Israeli airspace), but the matter was immediately resolved as the Russian plane returned towards Syria,"" the Israeli minister said on Sunday.

The minister said that Israel did not react, as it was aware that ""Russian planes do not intend to attack us."" He did not give out specific details about when the incident occurred.

The comments were made a week after Turkey shot down a Russian jet which it claims briefly violated its airspace, causing a grave deterioration in the relations between the two countries.

Israel annexed the Golan Heights territories, along the Syrian border, in the 1967 Mideast War, and although it claims not to interfere with the civil war in Syria, it did reportedly carry out several air strikes in recent years, targeting arms transfers to the Lebanese Hezbollah organisation.

Last year, Israel shot down a Syrian jet that penetrated Israeli airspace, as well as an unmanned aerial vehicle.

Russia has been carrying out air raids in Syria since September, in a bid to crack down on terrorist groups in the country, notably the Islamic State group, while the west has accused Moscow of trying to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by bombing the rebels.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Russian President Vladimir Putin the same month in Moscow, where the two leaders agreed on orchestrating a mechanism that would prevent accidents between Israeli and Russian forces in the area.

Israeli and Russian military representatives have held consultations in devising such a mechanism in the past two months. Netanyahu is set to meet Putin on Monday in Paris on the sidelines of a climate change summit held in the French capital.

Israel regularly violates Syrian air space without incident and routinely invades Lebanon air space despite UN resolutions preventing if from doing do. Neither Syria or Lebanon have attacked Israeli aircraft as a result of its incursions.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/999854220075000/?type=3,2015-11-29 11:37:55,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_996000020460420,"BAMAKO, Mali - Gunmen stormed a Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako, the capital of the West African nation of Mali, on Friday morning, and seized at least 170 hotel guests as hostages. Many people were reported killed, reports said.

Olivier Salgado, a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali, said the number killed was . Bodies were found in the basement and on the second floor, according to a preliminary assessment of the devastating attack.

Around four or five gunmen, took ""about 100 hostages"" at the beginning of the siege, said Gen. Didier Dacko of the Malian Army. He said soldiers had sealed the perimeter and were now ""inside looking for the terrorists.""

Mali's security minister, Col. Salif Traore, said all hostages were safe after gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu hotel, leading to a seven-hour standoff.

One witness said the attackers freed some captives who were able to recite verses from the Koran. An Al-Qaeda-linked group claimed partial responsibility for the attack.

The Reuters news agency, citing UN officials, said at least 19 people had died.

Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, said the attack killed ""an unknown number of civilians and injured many more."" Three UN staff members in the hotel during the attack were safely evacuated, he said. The world body has envoys in Bamako as part of Mali peace efforts.

Officials said four gunmen were holed up in a hotel room, but that there are no hostages with them.

A group affiliated with al-Qaeda, al-Mourabitou, said its followers were behind the attack  similar to a hotel assault in August that was also claimed by the same militants.

Mali has faced repeated attacks from insurgents linked to al-Qaeda and other factions, but the Islamic State does not have major footholds in the region.

The attack, Saldago said, came as the hotel hosted diplomatic delegations working on a peace process in the landlocked country, a former French colony that has been battling Islamist extremists with the help of UN and French forces.

By late afternoon, the siege appeared to be ending.

No more hostages were being held, said Colonel Salif Traore, Mali's minister of interior security.

Two assailants had been killed, he said, but security forces were still sweeping the hotel for other attackers who had holed up in a corner of the hotel.

Mongi Hamdi, head of the UN mission in Mali, said the diplomats' meetings, which began Thursday, were a possible reason for the attack.

""I think this attack has been perpetrated by negative forces, terrorists, who do not want to see peace in Mali,"" Hamdi said.

Friday's hotel attack, and the diplomats' meeting, came in a country that has struggled with Islamist extremists, especially since 2012.

The siege in Mali, a former French colony, came only a week after terrorists with assault rifles and suicide vests killed 129 people in attacks in Paris.

France on Friday afternoon said it dispatched to Mali an elite paramilitary group trained in hostage rescue and counterterrorism operations.

French President Francois Hollande, speaking to reporters in Paris, pledged to provide ""necessary support"" to help Mali resolve the situation.",Photos from Big News Network's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/995999740460448/?type=3,2015-11-20 20:40:58,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

He burst onto the global stage at the 1995 Rugby World Cup when he scored seven tries in four matches, including four tries in the semi-final against England.

He had been diagnosed with a rare and serious kidney condition by 1996.

It forced him to quit the game and he had a kidney transplant in 2004, but the organ stopped functioning in 2011.

Lomu died at his home of cardiac arrest on Tuesday night.

News of his death filtered out on Wednesday morning.

""It is with great sadness that I must announce my dear husband Jonah Lomu died last night,"" Nadene Lomu posted on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon.

""As you can imagine this is a devastating loss for our family and may I ask that our privacy, especially the privacy of our two very young boys, be respected as we take them through this traumatic time.""

Lomu and his wife have two sons, Brayley 6, and Dhyreille 5.

On Saturday he had paid tribute to the victims of the Paris attacks on his Facebook page. ""Our Hearts go out to the people of Paris Sois fort my friends. From the lomu family,"" he posted while stopping off in Dubai on his way home.

Lomu had been in the UK with his family for the past 2 months for the Rugby World Cup. 

""I am thankful that I have a beautiful wife and the kids are here. Nadine makes sure that my family stays together. She is my manager, my wife, my best friend and my boss,"" he told reporters.

""We're all shocked and deeply saddened at the sudden death of Jonah. We're lost for words and our heartfelt sympathies go out to Jonah's family. Jonah was a legend of our game and loved by his many fans both here and around the world,"" New Zealand Rugby chief executive Steve Tew in a statement Wednesday.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key who is in Manila said ""He was someone that knew his heritage and history well, and Pacific culture, but absolutely loved the All Black jersey and loved the interaction he had with the New Zealand public.""

""He is truly a legend of the game and I think New Zealanders will really feel Jonah's loss in an amazing way.""

While flags were being flown at half mast throughout New Zealand Wednesday, Lomu was honoured in Parliament. 

""He was a man who came from very humble beginnings in Mangere, South Auckland, and rose to become the first ever global rugby superstar,"" Sports Minister Jonathan Coleman told the parliament in Wellington.

""He was a major inspiration to a whole generation of Polynesian men, because Jonah proved that you could come from anywhere in New Zealand and make it to the very top.""

NZ First leader Winston Peters said, ""He was simply the greatest player we have ever seen. It is a very sad day, a tragedy.""

Trevor Mallard, on behalf of Labour, said: ""A combination of international television...and Adidas, frankly, meant that he went from being one of our stars to a world star.""

Mallard also paid tribute to New Zealand radio personality Grant Kereama for donating his kidney to Lomu in 2004, which extended the former All Black's life and quality of living.

Green Party MP Kevin Hague said, ""He was often the last player to leave the field, still signing autographs for kids until the kids were gone.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/995151077211981/?type=3,2015-11-18 20:32:47,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_993168067410282,"Eight suspected attackers were killed during the hostages rescue operation conducted by French security forces on Saturday at the Bataclan theater after Paris saw a series of explosions and shootings on Friday that killed at least 129 people and injured 352.

Six simultaneous shootings rocked central Paris Friday night with one of which turned to hostage taking at the Bataclan theatre and concert hall where hundreds of people were attending a concert of a rock group, Xinhua reported.

During anti-terrorist forces assault at the hall, at least 112 people died and five suspected attackers were killed, government officials said.

Two explosions were heard near the national football stadium Stade de France where a France-Germany friendly soccer match was being played, attended by French President Francois Hollande.

Rushing back to the Interior Ministry from Stade de France, Hollande condemned the ""unprecedented terrorist attacks"".

In the 11th district of Paris, after shooting in the theatre Batacla, police confirmed a hostage taking. During police's deployment in front of the theatre, two or three individuals, heavily armed, opened fire at the security forces.

In an eyewitness report posted on Europe1 website, Julien Pierce, a journalist said ""two or three individuals, who are not wearing masks and armed with kalachnikov entered the hall while the concert was underway and started blindly shooting at the crowd"".

In a brief statement on television, the French president declared a state of emergency across the country and the borders were to be closed.

""Some places will be closed, traffic will be banned and searches may be conducted throughout the Ile-de-France,"" he said, adding about 1,500 military reinforcements have been deployed ""to ensure that no other attack can take place"".

In addition, the capital schools and universities will be closed on Saturday.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Paris attacks, but according to the news channel BFMTV, the terrorists shouted ""It's for Syria"".

Seven of the 8 attackers killed blew themselves up.

The likely coordinated attacks came as France, a member of the US-led coalition combating the Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq, struck the group's strategic targets this week.

On high alert for terrorist attacks, the French government raised the anti-terrorism alert to maximum and additional thousands of security forces have been poured across the country to protect sensitive sites.

Hollande, who cancelled his participation at the G20 summit, will head a defense meeting on Saturday morning after the deadly attacks has shaken the country's security policy ahead of the high-profile international conference on climate scheduled for the end of this month.

Meanwhile, the international community has strongly condemned the attacks on the French capital.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned ""the despicable terrorist attacks carried out today in various locations in and around Paris"".

British Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the deadly attacks in Paris, offering ""thoughts and prayers"" to the French people.

""I am shocked by events in Paris tonight. Our thoughts and prayers are with the French people. We will do whatever we can to help,"" Cameron said via his Twitter account.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday evening that she was deeply shocked by the attacks in Paris and declared solidarity with France.

US President Barack Obama on Friday condemned the deadly attacks currently still unfolding in Paris and said it was too early to determine who was behind those attacks.

Calling the attacks in and around Paris on Friday evening ""an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians,"" Obama said the US stood ready to provide assistance for the French government.

He also said US officials were ""in contact with French counterparts to communicate condolences to families of the victims"".",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/993168067410282/?type=3,2015-11-13 21:30:38,2,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

The local Lebanese daily newspaper The Daily Star quoted security sources as saying at least 44 people had been killed, while Reuters say 240 more have been injured.

The casualties came when the suicide bombers detonated explosives in a pro-Hezbollah area of Lebanon's capital late Thursday.

Islamic State said in a statement posted online its members blew up a bike loaded with explosives and that when onlookers gathered, a suicide bomber blew himself up among them. 

Interior Minister Nouhad Machnouk told Reuters a third suicide bomber was killed by one of the explosions before he could detonate his bomb. His body was found nearby.

The local Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah, believed to have been the target of the attacks, had no comment on the blastswhich took place near a Shi'ite center in the Borj al-Barajneh area of Beirut.

109808052412959_987496487977440,"CAIRO, Egypt - 224 people are feared dead following the crash of a Russian jet on a flight from the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh to St Petersburg, Russia.

Egyptian Prime Minister Sharif Ismail has confirmed the crash, in the Sinai in an area called Hassaneh, south of Al-Areesh, took place just 30 minutes after the plane had taken off.

Egyptian officials say the Airbus A-321, Metrojet Flight 9268, was a chartered aircraft carrying 217 passengers, including seventeen children, along with 7 crew members.  The crash site has been spotted and a rescue operation is underway.  It is not clear if there were any survivors, but the likelihood is close to zero. In fact by late Saturday afternoon 100 bodies had been retrieved from the crash site, and they have been flown from North Sinai to Cairo. Other odd remnants are being collated for identification, Al Ahram newspaper reported, quoting medical sources in North Sinai.

Metrojet, which until 2012 was known as Kolavia Airlines,  or Kogalymavia Airlines, is an airline based in the oil producing town Kogalym in the Urals region of Russia.

The Egyptian prime minister's office says the prime minister has scheduled an emergency meeting with government and security officials, while the Russian Foreign Ministry says on its Facebook page that it is monitoring the situation.

Russia late Saturday advised it had launched an investigation into the crash and the airline involved, citing reports during the week from Metrojet personnel that the plane involved in the crash had been experiencing engine problems.

The plane took off at 5:51 a.m. local time (03:51 UTC) and is reported to have lost contact with air traffic control less than a half hour later.  

It was later reported the pilot was in contact with air traffic control immediately before the crash requesting an airport for an emergency landing.

The cause of the crash is not known, but authorities have said it was not shot down.

Smith said that with another highly successful NRL season just finished and the ARLC financial year end approaching, it was the ideal time for the game to plan for the next phase of its future.

""Rugby League is a fantastic game with wonderful people involved at every level and it has been a privilege to lead the game,"" Mr Smith said.

""Together with the ARLC, the 16 NRL Clubs and the State Leagues we have made significant progress in modernising Rugby League and, having assessed our progress and year end position, it is clear we now have the foundations in place for long term success.

""We have secured the biggest free to air broadcast deal in our history, $1.6 billion for investment in Rugby League stadiums and a financial platform that includes a sustainability fund of $50m and a surplus of $100m that is progressively being invested back into the game, and a 48% increase in non-broadcast revenue.

""We are consistently enjoying record breaking Origin and Finals Series and we have grown significantly with more than 300,000 fans converted into club members; new pathways for elite, recreational and female players; the biggest digital profile and reach of any sport in Australia; and we've introduced some new products such as the Auckland Nines and World Cup Challenge.

""Importantly we've also set new, higher standards when it comes to our brand, reputation and integrity which will solidify our growth. The game is now safer, more in line with community expectations and just as exciting for fans,"" he said.

""I've been a change agent for most of my career and the time has come for me to handover to a new leader to consolidate these gains and I finish with pride in the game's achievements.

''I'd like to thank John Grant and the Commissioners for their first class leadership and ongoing support, as well as the support I've received from the NRL Clubs and State Leagues,"" Mr Smith said.

""And I want to thank, in particular, all the NRL staff who work so hard to make this game so successful.""

In acknowledging Mr Smith's contribution, Mr John Grant said the progress the game has made in three years has been very significant and they are tracking strongly against almost all the targets in the game's strategic plan.

""Dave has been a wonderful leader and change agent for our game,"" Mr Grant said.

""We all understood that it would take between three to five years to effect meaningful change and to build the platforms from which the game could continue to grow and succeed.

""We are now financially strong, organisationally sound and have strengthened the game's connection to the fans,"" Mr Grant concluded.

''On behalf of the whole Rugby League community I want to thank Dave for his tenacity, hard work and the momentum he has started to help our game become the most entertaining, engaging and respected sport,"" Mr Grant said.

The ARLC has appointed Signium International to facilitate the recruitment process for a new Chief Executive.

That search will include both internal and external candidates.

While that process is underway Mr Grant will take on executive responsibilities and senior management will share some additional duties and report directly to him.

Mr Grant said the immediate priorities going forward would include advancing the broadcast rights negotiations, a new funding model for clubs, and working with Governments in NSW and Queensland to deliver the stadia projects in the pipeline.

He said that in this next phase, the attention would more purposefully put the game and grass roots Rugby League at the centre of our planning and investment.

""The business is in good shape for the incoming CEO and it's a very exciting time for all of us as part of rugby league we are ready to move into the next phase,"" Mr Grant said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/982949755098780/?type=3,2015-10-19 22:13:28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_982015105192245,"SYDNEY, Australia - The timely arrival of a police patrol outside a wedding functions centre on Saturday night has probably prevented a major brawl from breaking out.

A police patrol unit happened on the scene around ten o'clock on Saturday night at the function centre in Bridge street, in the western Sydney suburb of Lidcombe where a wedding was being held.

Two crowds of people were situated on opposite sides of the street hurling abuse at each other.

Police officers tried to move the two groups on from the area, however both crowds became bigger and more aggressive, and began obstructing police efforts.

When attempting to restrain a 33-year-old man, police say he assaulted an unknown man in the crowd several times, before resisting police.

A 23-year-old man in the crowd was arrested after allegedly attempting to assault a male, before resisting police while being detained.

It is expected that the two men will be given Future Court Attendance Notices for affray and resist arrest to appear at Burwood Local Court on 1 December 2015.

A 20-year-old woman was arrested and is expected to be issued a court infringement notice for offensive language/behaviour, after allegedly abusing and screaming at police.

A 24-year-old man was arrested after allegedly failing to comply with a move-on directions.

An investigation into the incident is continuing, further charges are expected to be laid.

Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward and contact Crime Stoppers.

A person from the wedding was taken to hospital, to be treated for minor injuries.

109808052412959_978832968843792,"BRUSSELS, Belgium - The United States has urged NATO to slow down its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan scheduled after 2016 amid indications that the America-led military alliance is willing to extend the 14-year-old mission beyond the next year.

US Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Thursday said that nearly all North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries agreed that the mission in Afghanistan needs to be extended.

""A number of countries today indicated a willingness to change their plans and posture,"" Carter said after a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters ""that many allies and many ministers expressed the need to be flexible and to take into account the security situation on the ground when we make our decisions"".

""I sense many allies are willing to stay longer if needed.""

The rethink, which was in the offing for sometime but attracted more advocacy, comes days after the Taliban briefly took over the provincial capital of Kunduz, stoking concern about the capability of Afghan security forces. Afghan forces have, however, recaptured the strategic northern city.

Currently there are about 12,000 coalition troops, including about 10,000 US military personnel, in Afghanistan.

President Barrack Obama had favored leaving all but a few hundred US and coalition troops in the war-torn country before he demits his office next year.

NATO leaders, according to sources, have also cited the country's fragile stability, underscored by the Taliban's resurgence seizure and the mistaken US airstrike that hit a Doctors Without Borders hospital and resulted in 22 civilian deaths.

""I have asked all of the NATO partners to remain flexible and to consider the possibility of making adjustments to the plan, which is now two-and-half-years old, for the presence in Afghanistan in coming years,"" Carter said.

Germany has also favored a rethink on the troop withdrawal based on the ground situation and analysis of security conditions, rather than chasing a deadline for withdrawal.

""If the Afghan people need for a longer time our support, we need to look at how we go forward and whether we should stay longer,"" Ursula von der Leyen, the German defense minister, said at the start of the meeting.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/978832968843792/?type=3,2015-10-10 14:12:09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_971052226288533,"CAIRO, Egypt - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday pardoned 100 prisoners, including Al Jazeera journalists Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed.

Mohamed, Fahmy and Peter Greste were sentenced to three years in prison on Aug. 29, following a retrial of a 2014 decision that critics said was based on ludicrous charges and a lack of incriminating evidence.

The claim is that the journalists produced biased news, which by default makes them part of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the group that former President Mohammed Morsi belonged to when he was overthrown in 2013. The group is considered a terrorist organization by the Egyptian government.

The government sought to extradite Greste, who had already left the country after being deported. Fahmy and Mohamed were detained in Egypt's Tora Prison.

Fahmy was serving as acting bureau chief in Cairo for Al Jazeera's English network at the time of his arrest.

All three broadcasters denied the allegations, saying that they were just reporting the news. Amnesty International agreed, saying the verdicts for both men further complicated freedom of expression in Egypt.

The other detainees pardoned by al-Sisi's list are part of thousands of individuals arrested by authorities as part of a crackdown on free speech.

Earlier in September, the Canadian government formally requested that the Egyptian government pardon Fahmy or deport him to Canada and in early September, more than 300 Canadians pressed Prime Minister Stephen Harper to further pressure Egypt to release him.

Fahmy's brother Adel told the Toronto Star he was ""speechless."" 

Both journalists were released within hours of the pardon.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/971052226288533/?type=3,2015-09-23 14:43:31,1,0,7,1,0,0,0,0,0
109808052412959_970725189654570,"The State of Israel was established on the ruins of Palestine, based on a series of objectives that were initialed by letters from the Hebrew alphabet, the consequences of which continue to guide Israeli strategies to this day. The current violence against Palestinian worshippers at al-Aqsa Mosque in Occupied East Jerusalem is a logical extension of the same Zionist ambition.  

Plan A (February, 1945), Plan B (May, 1947) and Plan C (November, 1947) all strove to achieve the same end: the ethnic cleansing of Palestine of its original inhabitants. It was not until March 1948 that Plan Dalet (Hebrew for Plan D) brought together all of the preparatory stages for final implementation.   

Championed by the Haganah Jewish militias, 'Plan Dalet' saw the destruction of hundreds of villages, the depopulation of entire cities and the defense of the new country's borders, ensuring Palestinian refugees are never allowed back. For Palestinians, that phase of their history is known as the ""Nakba"", or the ""Catastrophe"". 

'Dalet' was an astounding success from the Zionists' viewpoint. However, the borders were never truly defined - in order to allow for territorial expansion, at the opportune time. That moment came when Israel launched its war of 1967 (known to Palestinians as 'Naksa' or the 'Setback'), seizing East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, thus sealing the fate of entire historic Palestine.  

Occupied Jerusalem was not open for negotiations: it is Israel's historic, eternal and undivided capital, they claimed, citing or misinterpreting biblical references as they saw fit. Almost immediately, the Israeli Government annexed Jerusalem by extending the West Jerusalem municipal borders to include newly conquered East Jerusalem.  

It was not until 1980 when Israel passed a law that explicitly annexed the illegally occupied city to become part of the so-called Israel proper.  

Since then, Jerusalem has been a major point of strife, political conflict and controversy. Understandably, the Jerusalem political discourse is conflated with discussion about religion, but it is far more encompassing than a conflict over access to holy sites.  

The fate of Jerusalem and its holy sites cannot be understood separately from the fate of Palestine. And the daily struggle of Palestinian Muslims and Christians in that City is a representation of the struggle of Palestinians everywhere. 

As West Jerusalem was conquered under 'Plan Dalet', East Jerusalem, like the rest of the Occupied Territories was, along with other Palestinian regions, the target of another plan: The 'Allon Plan'. 

It was named after Yigal Allon, a former general and minister in the Israeli Government, who took on the task of drawing an Israeli vision for the newly conquered Palestinian Territories. While the Israeli Government moved to immediately change the status quo governing East Jerusalem, the 'Allon Plan' sought to annex more than 30 percent of the West Bank and all of Gaza for 'security purposes'. 

It stipulated the establishment of a ""security corridor"" along the River Jordan, as well outside the ""Green Line"", a one-sided Israeli demarcation of its borders with the West Bank. The plan envisioned the incorporation of all of the Gaza Strip into Israel, and was meant to return parts of the West Bank to Jordan as a first step toward implementing the ""Jordanian option"" for Palestinian refugees, i.e., ethnic cleansing, coupled with the creation of an 'alternative homeland' for Palestinians.  

While the plan did not fully actualize, the seizure, ethnic cleansing and annexation of occupied land was a resounding success. Moreover, the 'Allon Plan' provided an unmistakable signal that the Labor Government, which ruled Israel at the time, had every intention of retaining large parts of the West Bank and all of Gaza, with no intention of honoring United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which challenged Israel's military takeover of Palestinian territories. 

To ensure seizure of new land would be irreversible, the Labor Government needed to move some of its citizens (in violation of the Geneva Conventions) to the newly-occupied territories. Doing so required reaching out to the most reactionary, religious elements of Israeli society, the religious- ultra-nationalists camps, who were on the margins of mainstream politics. 

To capitalize on the Government's alluring settlement policies in the West Bank, a group of religious Jews rented a hotel in the Palestinian town of al-Khalil (Hebron) to spend Passover at the 'Cave of the Patriarchs', and simply refused to leave, sparking the biblical passion of religious Orthodox Israelis across the country, who referred to the West Bank by the Biblical name, Judea and Samaria.  

The move ignited the ire of Palestinians, who watched in complete dismay as their land was conquered, renamed and, later, settled by outsiders. In 1970, to 'diffuse' the situation, the Israeli Government constructed the 'Kiryat Arba' Settlement on the outskirts of the Arab city, which invited even more orthodox Jews to al-Khalil. 

The 'Allon Plan' may have been intended for strategic purposes; but out of necessity, what began as political objectives intermingled with what became religious and spiritual.  

Over the years, the strategic settlement growth was complemented by the religiously motivated expansion, championed by a vibrant movement, exemplified in the founding of ""Gush Emunim"" (Bloc of the Faithful) in 1974.  Its mission was to settle legions of fundamentalists on the West Bank.   

Little has changed since, save the fact that the current Israeli Government is a government of settlers, who are not engaged in a symbiotic relationship with the Government but who dominate a political establishment that is teeming with zealots and fanatics, relentless on changing the status quo in Jerusalem, starting with Haram al-Sharif, or the 'Noble Sanctuary'.  

Haram al-Sharif is one of the holiest Islamic sites, but this is not just about religion. Israeli politicians have been 'debating' the status of Haram al-Sharif for many months, as right-wing, religious and ultra-nationalists elements are advocating the complete appropriation of the al-Aqsa Mosque (situated in Haram al-Sharif),  currently under the management of the Islamic Trust (known as 'Waqf'.)  

Israel's new Minister of Internal Security, Gilad Erdan, is repressing any Palestinian in Jerusalem who dares challenge new Israeli rules regarding Muslim access to al-Aqsa. Scores of Palestinians have been shot, beaten and many more arrested in recent days as they have attempted to confront Israeli police  who escort Jewish extremists on their provocative 'tours' of the Muslim holy site.  

The current conflict suggests a repeat of what took place on  February 25, 1994, when a US-born Jewish fanatic, Baruch Goldstein, stormed into the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Palestinian city of al-Khalil and opened fire. Over 50 Palestinians were killed while kneeling for prayer on that day. In the name of 'keeping the peace', the Israeli army took over the Mosque and began regulating Muslim access to it, allowing Jewish worshippers to the Palestinian holy site. 

Goldstein and his most ardent supporters hailed from the notorious ""Kiryat Arba"" illegal Jewish settlement.  

Israeli politicians now want to see the al-Aqsa Mosque status changed as well. The Government wants to ensure its complete dominance over Palestinians, while the extremists wanted to demolish the Mosque, seeking ancient Jewish temples presumably destroyed in 586 BC and AD 70.  

But to change the status of Haram al-Sharif, which has been an exclusive Muslim site for the last 1,300 years, much blood would have to be spilled. That, too, is being managed by Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has successfully pursued the country's Attorney General to permit the use of sniper fire against protesting Palestinian youth.  

With such right-wing and extremist politicians at his side, Netanyahu's designs on Jerusalem are consistent with the political mood in Israel today, and also consistent with plans enacted by his predecessors many years ago. 

The fact that plans to conquer even the remaining symbols of Palestinian nationhood and spirituality have finally reached al-Aqsa is particularly alarming. Considering the turmoil throughout the Middle East region and the ineffectual Palestinian leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, Netanyahu is likely to push forward with his plan, no matter the price or the consequences.

109808052412959_965789336814822,"CANBERRA, Australia - Tony Abbott has announced Liberal MPs will vote on Monday night for the leadership and deputy leadership, after Malcolm Turnbull's challenge to the Prime Minister's leadership.

In a brief 6:15pm news conference at which he took no questions, Abbott pitched to his colleagues not to do a repeat of Labor.

""I have been heartened by the messages of support flooding into Liberal MPs' offices this evening saying most emphatically, 'we are not the Labor Party'"".

He said Australia needed strong and stable government ""and that means avoiding, at all costs, Labor's revolving-door prime ministership"".

Abbott said he could be trusted to deliver a stronger economy and a safer community.

""The prime ministership of this country is not a prize or a plaything to be demanded. It should be something which is earned by a vote of the Australian people.""

He said he expected to win the ballot.

""Obviously, I am dismayed by the destabilisation thats been taking place now for many, many months and I do say to my fellow Liberals that the destabilisation just has to stop.

""I firmly believe that our party is better than this, that our government is better than this and, by God, that our country is so much better than this.""

Earlier:

Malcolm Turnbull has launched his much-anticipated challenge to Tony Abbott for the prime ministership, declaring he had been urged by ""many people over a long period"" to do so.

Abbott will fight for his position, with a ballot expected on Monday night.

After confronting the prime minister on Monday afternoon, asking for a Liberal partyroom ballot, and resigning as communications minister, Turnbull told a press conference, ""we need a different style of leadership"".

Turnbull said that Abbott ""has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence business needs"".

In a swingeing attack on Abbott's style, Turnbull said: ""We need advocacy not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.

""We also need a new style of leadership in the way we deal with others  whether it is our fellow members of parliament, whether it is the Australian people.

""We need to restore traditional cabinet government. There must be an end to policy on the run and captain's calls.

""We need an open government that recognises that the is an enormous sum of wisdom within our colleagues in this building and, of course, further afield.""

Turnbull invoked John Howard's government as a ""great example of good cabinet government"".

""Few would say that the cabinet government of Mr Abbott bears any similarity to the style of Mr Howard. So that's what we need to go back to.""

He said if the government continued with Abbott as prime minister, it was clear what would happen  he would lose the election and Bill Shorten would succeed him.

""The one thing that is clear about our current situation is the trajectory. We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott's leadership.""

The dramatic Turnbull challenge came after tension and destabilisation built over the weekend and during Monday. Liberal deputy leader Julie Bishop went to Abbott before Question Time to tell him that he had lost the party's confidence.

The leadership has come to a head less than a week out from the Canning byelection, with polls showing the government is set to hold the seat but with a big swing against it.

Turnbull said he recognised the timing was ""far from ideal"". ""But regrettably, there are few occasions that are entirely ideal for tough calls and tough decisions like this.""

The government was only ten or eleven months from an election and ""every month lost is a month of lost opportunities.

""We have to make a change for our country's sake, for the government's sake, for the party's sake.""

He said a change of leadership would improve the Liberals' chances in Canning.

Turnbull said he was motivated ""by a commitment to serve the Australian people to ensure that our Liberal values continue to be translated into good government, sound policies, economic confidence creating the jobs and the prosperity for the future"".

On climate change and same-sex marriage, on which he has well-known moderate views, Turnbull is promising to stick with the announced climate targets for the Paris climate conference and a popular vote promised on same-sex marriage. This is a bid to maximise his vote among right-wingers.

Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett launched a ferocious attack on Turnbull in a series of tweets, calling him a ""selfish, undisciplined individual"".

109808052412959_965040643556358,"ABU DHABI, UAE - The number of Emirati soldiers killed in last Friday's attack on a Saudi-led coalition arms depot in Yemen has been upgraded from 45 to 52.

A lengthy and complex identification process which has followed the brutal attack has identified 7 more bodies of those killed as UAE soldiers.

The bodies of all killed at the depot that had not been identified were transported to Saudi Arabia. The General Command of the UAE Armed Forces revealed on Saturday that the death toll of Emirati soldiers had been raised to 52. The bodies of the seven additional soldiers were received at the Al Bateen Executive Airport in Abu Dhabi later on Saturday.

A special military ceremony involving a large number of senior military officers and personnel was held on the arrivals of the bodies at the airport.

The UAE is participating in the Saudi Arabian-led coalition's mission known as 'Operation Restoring Hope' in a bid to restore the ousted government to power and to re-take the capital Sanaa from Al Houthi rebels.

The attack on Friday, say the rebels was in response to the air-strikes undertaken by Saudi Arabia and coalition forces which began in March.

An arms depot at a military base in the eastern province of Marib in central Yemen, near the border with Saudi Arabia was attacked last Friday resulting in the 52 UAE soldiers deaths, together with the death of ten Saudi soldiers and 5 Bahrainis.

An unknown number of soldiers were injured in the attack, however none of the militaries involved, or their governments have disclosed the number of soldiers injured.

The coalition has vowed to continue its quest to free Yemen of the Al Houthi rebels and have stepped up their air strikes in the days following last Friday's attack.

Ground forces involving more than 10,000 troops from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain were this week joined by 1,000 soldiers from Qatar and a contingent of Saudi special forces soldiers.

It is understood the coalition is preparing for a ground assault in a bid to re-take Sanaa.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/965040643556358/?type=3,2015-09-13 04:53:59,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

At about 9:15 on Thursday morning the man, Stephen Lock, 57, was meeting his wife Karina,49, to discuss their divorce.

As the couple cam together it is alleged Mr Lock produced a gun and shot his wife in the head. He then turned the gun on himself and shot himself in the head.

Karina Lock died at the scene while her  husband was rushed by ambulance to Gold Coast University Hospital with life-threatening injuries.

""I am not going to go into the specifics of it because it is quite a graphic and tragic incident that has occurred and that is obviously the focus of our investigation,"" Queensland Police Services' Detective Inspector Mark White told reporters.

""We're also looking at the CCTV footage that was available inside the premises.""

(Stephen Lock)... he just walked inside, put his arm around her and just put the gun to her chest and shot her. It was just horrific.""

Asked whether there was concern for the McDonalds staff and customers who witness the incident, the inspector responded: ""Absolutely only imagine what it's like to go about your normal business and to have something like that occur right in front of you."" 

""We are mindful of that and we are looking at avenues to ensure that any person who did witness it or was nearby can access some form of counselling or support that they may need.""

""Some of them are actually quite distraught to be honest, and when you have an appreciation of what's occurred, you can understand that, Detective Inspector White said..

""Part of the process that we're going through with taking statements  and we appreciate their cooperation  is to also ensure if they do need some support, that we can make appropriate referrals or get in touch with people, because it's not something that you would encounter in your everyday life.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/962822797111476/?type=3,2015-09-10 11:54:28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
109808052412959_962821457111610,"CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia is joining an international coalition targeting Islamic State militants in Syria with airstrikes, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Wednesday.

Abbott approved Royal Australian Air Force bombing raids on IS territory in Syria, joining a growing coalition including the United States, Canada and Turkey.

Australia was already involved in its own bombing campaign against IS targets in Iraq.

Abbott also agreed to resettle 12,000 Syrian refugees in Australia. The government will accept Syrian refugees determined to be the subject of persecution, giving priority to women and children.

These refugees will be able to live in Australia permanently, which will bode well with Australians, the majority of whom support easing policies, a recent opinion poll shows. A survey from Lonergan Research found 57 percent of people believe Australia should take in more Syrian refugees, though 54 percent think Abbott is doing a poor job handling the situation.

Australians are still in support of the government's Operation Sovereign Border, which blocks asylum seekers coming to Australia illegally and detains them at small Pacific Islands nearby.

Several so-called ""Light the Dark"" candlelight vigils drew large crowds in Sydney and Canberra in recent days, demonstrating public support for a more formidable humanitarian response from the Australian government.

News of Australia's new refugee policy comes as countries in the Europe Union struggle to cope with an ever-increasing number of migrants. It also marks an about-face for the typically conservative and uncomprimising approach taken by the Australian government toward migrants.

Abbott said the new flights over Syria would not represent ""a marked increase"" in risk to RAAF pilots.

Cities of conflict between President Bashar Assad's forces and rebels, such as Aleppo and Damascus, would not be touched on the grounds that there is no legal basis for Australia to launch attacks there.Tomas Monzon (UPI)>",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/962821457111610/?type=3,2015-09-10 11:49:39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_959285050798584,"LONDON - All it took to stir up world attention towards the plight of Syrian refugees were gut-wrenching images of a lifeless child lying face down a child who along with family had fled his home to escape death.

And the moment these haunting images of Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy, unfolding the full horror of human tragedy, appeared online through media portals and social media networks, the world woke up and began seriously debating the issue and how it can be handled in a humane way.

On Friday, Aylan's body arrived in the Turkish city of Istanbul. From there, it was taken home to Kobani, the Syrian city his family left to escape the daily barrage of bombs.

Aylan drowned along with his mother Rehan and his five-year-old brother Ghalib on Wednesday. The three-year-old's body in a bright-red T-shirt and shorts washed up on the Turkey beach.

The photos galvanized the world and have become the latest symbol of the migrant crisis in Europe.

The family was among the thousands making the treacherous journey aboard overcrowded rafts in the choppy Mediterranean waters. They were trying to get to Sweden by way of Greece, said Aylan's father Abdullah Kurdi, describing his life as hopeless without his family.

""I don't want anything else from this world,"" he told CNN on Thursday. ""Everything I was dreaming of is gone. I want to bury my children and sit beside them until I die.""

European nations had earlier been refusing to share the burden of an influx of migrants unprecedented since World War II, triggered by millions of Syrian refugees who are escaping the deadly four-year old civil war.

The conflict has left an estimated 240,000 people dead and over three million have fled to immediate neighbouring countries Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Some 6.5 million are displaced within the war-torn country.

Britain on Friday softened its stand and vowed to spend a further 100 million pounds or $152 million on humanitarian aid to address the refugee crisis.

""Today I can announce that we will provide a further 100 million pounds, taking our total contribution to over 1 billion pounds. That is the UK's largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters during a visit to Spain.

""Sixty million pounds of this additional funding will go to help Syrians still in Syria. The rest will go to neighboring countries - to Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, where Syrian refugees now account for one quarter of the population.""

He said his nation shared the moral responsibility to tackle the crisis.

""We, as a moral nation, will fulfill our moral obligations, our humanitarian obligations, by taking people directly from Syrian refugee camps. We will work with others in Europe to try and strengthen the external borders of the EU even though we are not a Schengen (the border-free zone in parts of Europe) nation,"" Prime Minister David Cameron said.

""So I would say we are entering absolutely into the spirit of what others are doing. But we have a very clear view. The best (way) to help them is not to encourage them to make this dangerous journey but to resettle them in the refugee camps.""

But the response was still not up to what the world had expected.

On Friday, United Nations officials openly criticised European countries for their response or lack thereof to the worsening migrant crisis.

""The real issue here is the (European Union) member states, who are not prepared to recognise the fundamental reality that either there is a European solution to this, where everybody shares with a sense of solidarity and responsibility, or there can be no great improvement to the situation,"" said Peter Sutherland, UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration.

""If everybody retires behind their own borders and their own lines of defense, this will be a continuing and terrible disaster.""

The UNHCR calculates that some 205,000 Europe-bound refugees have entered Greece, mostly via its outlying Aegean isles, this year alone. The vast majority of them are Syrians.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/959285050798584/?type=3,2015-09-05 06:32:35,2,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0

He passed away in his sleep in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Cummings had an extraordinary career highlighted by the twelve Melbourne Cups he won, the first a half century ago when Light Fingers crossed the line first in 1965. It was the first of three consecutive Melbourne Cups the trainer would win.

Born in South Australia, Cummings has not enjoyed the best of health in recent years but has remained active and continued training.

Cummings father Jim was a horse trainer. He too trained a Melbourne Cup winner, Comic Court in 1950.

His son Anthony also trains horses. It was he who announced his father's death on Twitter.""Dad died peacefully in his sleep early this morning, surrounded by his family. He lived a full life,"" Anthony posted.

Grandson James also came into the training fold, forging a partnership with his grandfather in July 2013.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/954786304581792/?type=3,2015-08-30 04:43:52,2,0,22,2,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_948644348529321,"SYDNEY, Australia - Rugby league fans still harbouring a grudge against Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for its devastating attempt to hijack their game two decades ago must be reeling as Murdoch has again declared war on rugby league. Murdoch is furious that free-to-air television rights were sold to the Nine Network without other media groups, particularly News Corp, being given a chance to bid.

The NRL announcement of its record $925 million deal for free-to-air television rights to Channel 9 coincided with Mr Murdoch's arrival in Australia for a one-week visit. He was so enraged his own media outlets proffered that he changed his schedule to appear in a press conference in which the AFL announced earlier this week, its record $2.058 billion deal with Seven West, New Corp and Foxtel.

The bulk of the funds will come from News Corp, with many media reports suggesting News Corp was so unhappy with the NRL it pushed the boundary higher to embarrass NRL executives.

News Corps' journalists railed to the cause. After a week's awe of the extent of the NRL deal they all turned on rugby league with a ferocity. Paul Kent, a week after the deal was signed termed it a 'joke.' NRL heavyweights Dave Smith and John Grant who were invited to attend a News Corp lunch at Rose Bay ""had the gall to turn up,"" News Corp executives told rival newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald. Another News Corp article said the pair attended to ""rub News Corp's nose in it,"" and that when the pair left Smith had a 'smug smile' on his face.' What sort of journalism is that? Another report says the two attended the lunch to humiliate News Corp.

A story still runs with the headline ""Why smug Smith should walk away.""

""In what can only be described as the greatest rub your nose in it media conference in Australian sport, Murdoch changed his travel plans to be part of the Melbourne AFL show that should sound the death knell for Smith and Grant,"" Rebecca Wilson wrote in The Daily Telegraph on Thursday.

""The biggest free-to-air deal in Australian professional sport and pay television's largest commitment to any football code is a sign that Foxtel will not be bullied into paying top dollar for the four worst league games each weekend.""

""It is also apparent that New South Wales and Queensland are on notice. AFL is only going to get bigger, the back-up is coming from the media juggernauts at Seven and Foxtel, and the only loser will be rugby league,"" said the Daily Telegraph article.

""Rupert Murdoch fought tooth and nail to own rugby league and to control the television rights into perpetuity. He showed he would pay through the nose for them too,"" wrote Wilson.

""Now he has switched his allegiances and made it clear league is a poor relation.""

Yet only 10 days ago, possibly the most respected rugby league writer for the Daily Telegraph Phil Rothfield was saying: ""The biggest winners in the NRL's new television deal are the fans. Four games live on free-to-air television is a massive improvement on the previous deal in 2013 when there was originally only one live match on Friday nights.""

To see a major Australian-U.S. corporation of the size of News Corp throwing a tantrum like it has in the past 48 hours is extraordinary. The last time it didn't get its way with securing the broadcast rights for rugby league it launched the Super League War, which almost bankrupted the ARL and cost News Corp's shareholders several hundred million dollars in losses.

As part of the settlement News Corp became the owner of 50% of the newly-formed NRL which it relinquished three years ago. Ever since it has put the boots into the NRL on every opportunity it could.

The media group's journalists, many of whom feed off the NRL, covering the sport, appearing on rugby league sports shows, and writing books about the sport have no compulsion about denigrating it whenever instructed.

It is extraordinary to see a company the size of News Corp heaping such vengeance because it couldn't get its way. And to do it so publicly exhibits an arrogance that only it could get away with.

To over-pay for AFL rights to 'punish' the NRL, to publicly declare that you are going to put all your resources and clout to strengthen the AFL and ensure its expansion into the rugby league territories of New South Wales and Queensland to make a point is bizarre. Rugby league fans must be wondering what it is they've done to deserve the wrath of News Corp for a second time. It is they who are the majority of those who buy or subscribe to The Daily Telegraph, The Courier Mail, Foxtel and Fox Sports as much as anyone else. But News Corp doesn't care, it is out for revenge.

On Friday News Corp was at it again, suggesting rugby league is on the brink of losing its major sponsor Telstra, because it too is 'furious' over the rugby league's deal with Nine. ""News of the latest development continues a horror week for the NRL after its $925 million deal was dwarfed by a $2.5 billion deal,"" the Daily Telegraph sprouted, quite inaccurately.

Why in any event is News Corp so angry about the sale of free-to-air TV rights? It doesn't own any free-to-air television stations in Australia. Or does it?",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/948644348529321/?type=3,2015-08-20 18:08:51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_947727138621042,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - The Dubai stock exchange dived nearly 3% on Tuesday taking its loss for the month to 10%.

For the Dubai Financial Market General Inde it was the  biggest single-day drop for more than two months.

The region's largest property developer Emaar was down 3% as the property market in Dubai has come to a shuddering halt. Emaar routinely was announcing new projects last year but this year demand has evaporated. Prices have been sliding since the doubling of the transfer fee imposed by the Dubai government on property sales. The fee went from 2% to 4% in a bid to slow the market and enhance a lucrative revenue stream for the government. However the move punctured the real estate market and instead of doublings its returns from the transfer fees, the revenue stream has virtually dried up.

The only sales being recorded in the Dubai property market are those being transacted by distressed sellers, a  hallmark of the major property bust in Dubai of 2008-9.

Developers have introduced time payment plans, and are even offering to defer payment to sign up buyers to off-the-plan properties. The product mix has changed too as developers turn to the strata sale of hotel rooms offering buyers 40% of gross revenues, or in one case with the Hard Rock Hotel at the Dubai Marina, a 75% return of gross room revenue. The ploy however is ill-timed as the Dubai hotel market is faltering under the weight of an oversupply of rooms with a significant number more hotels and resorts to come on stream in the next 3 years.

Emaar's The Address Hotel properties will be impacted by a mushrooming of the company's brand in the Downtown area and is even looking at duplicating its Address Hotel at the Dubai Marina, which has been a relatively poor performer from the start. In June owners of rooms in the hotel pool saw their returns halved from a year ago, and last month they dropped to a third of what they received in July last year.

Compounding concern in the UAE is the plunge in the oil price which has gone from $114 a barrel a year ago to $48.25 on Tuesday, a 6-months low.

Dubai however is only notionally affected by the oil price as it produces very little oil. Most of the production in the country comes from Abu Dhabi which houses about 96% of the UAE's oil reserves.

Other Gulf countries are feeling the weight of the lower returns from oil production, to the point where the GCC is openly talking about introducing a region-wide VAT (value-added tax) which could see a tax of 5% added to the sale of all goods.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/947727138621042/?type=3,2015-08-18 18:08:39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
109808052412959_947409505319472,"SYDNEY, Australia - Popular talk back radio host Ray Hadley has slammed Malcolm Turnbull in two tirades on his national radio network.

The 2GB broadcaster who is heard on stations around the country has railed against Turnbull the current Australian Minister of Communications, on a number of occasions insisting the Australian electorate doesn't ""cop"" him and never will.

Turnbull is touted as a major candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party if there was a move on current leader Tony Abbott. This would hoist him into the prime ministership, which certain sectors of the media have vocally opposed for some time. Hadley however sees his station's new proprietor Fairfax Media as promoting a Turnbull candidature. 

Turnbull was Leader of the Opposition from September 2008 to December 2009. ""The reason Tony Abbott became the leader was because no-one liked Malcolm Turnbull,"" Hadley told his listeners on Monday. (Turnbull lost the leadership ballot to Abbott in December 2009 by one vote).

""He is further down the polls than this bloke ever has been, the current prime minister,"" Hadley said. (In fact a poll being conducted by Fairfax Media in which 26,476 of their readers had voted at the time of writing this article, 57% favoured Turnbull to lead the Coalition at the next election, compared to 14% for Tony Abbott, 6% for Julie Bishop and 3% for Scott Morrison).

Regardless Hadley was weighing into the communications minister, saying Bill Shorten ""would lap him"" if Turnbull were to be the leader at the next election. In talking about his own success and that of colleague Alan Jones, and former colleague and mentor John Laws, Hadley said he didn't know the reason for his and his colleagues' success. ""There's a secret that I can't define,"" he said. ""The connection between the broadcaster and his audience.....You either have it or you haven't got it, and in the same way with politics, there's a connection between the electorate and politicians, particularly those aspiring to be leader.""

""Malcolm Turnbull never had it,"" said Hadley. ""He's seen as an elitist snob. He mightn't be but that's how he's seen. He will not connect with the people.""

""And then he is in a photo taken with derogatory comments about the prime minister on a billboard worn by a bloke who used to be a councillor who obviously has mental health issues and he says I didn't see it.""

""There's a lot of things you don't see Malcolm because you walk around with your head stuck up your bum,"" said Hadley.

In another outburst on Monday, the 2GB broadcaster was interviewing the Federal Minister for Social Services Scott Morrison and asked him about reports circling about another leadership spill, which Hadley proffered would be won by him (Morrison).

""Well the distraction of all this and the commentary that goes around it, it's unhelpful,"" Morrison responded.

""Hadley countered, ""My point is if he (Turnbull) pulled his head in we wouldn't have all this. He puts himself out there.""

""Well the focus of the government,"" said Morrison, ""is to focus on the things that interest the Australian people and that's family domestic violence. We need to focus on jobs and family domestic violence. We need to focus on the Ice scourge affecting communities all around the country.""

Hadley bounded straight back to the potential for a leadership spill.

""Well there's not going to be one and the prime minister has my full support,"" Morrison declared.

""Well he doesn't appear to have the full support of Malcolm Turnbull who does his best to undermine him at every opportunity,"" Hadley fired angrily back. ""He's like a spoiled brat who lost the game, took the bat and ball and went home and now he comes back a number of years later and his mates at Fairfax are pushing his barrow despite the fact he's unelectable."" 

""In fact I would put this to you,"" Hadley continued. ""Anthony Albanese, Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek will be doing hand-stands if he's the leader of the government leading into the next election, because they'll lap him,"" he said.

""You know what Ray?"" Morrison asked Hadley""

""What,"" said Hadley.

""They will be doing hand stands every day that we're talking about this  and every day this is being speculated on in the media, so I'm not going to speculate on it. In fact I'm not going to speak about it.""

""If he (Turnbull) pulled his head in,"" said Hadley, ""we wouldn't have to.""

""He is like a petulant child who got shown the door by the party and he's been sour ever since,"" Hadley continued. He then paused waiting for Morrison to respond.

Morrison waited a while. ""I don't know what your expecting me to say Ray,"" he eventually said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/947409505319472/?type=3,2015-08-18 00:09:26,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_946708735389549,"The Productivity Commission Workplace Relations Framework draft report released earlier this month is an important milestone for Australia and has the right ideas  however, there are also several things missing from the report that must be exposed and discussed. The biggest problem with the report is its reliance on the 'politically convenient' ABS unemployment figures that consistently under-state the real level of unemployment and under-employment in the Australian workforce and the inadequate data on the cash economy.

There are two issues in relation to unemployment: the actual numbers in % terms and '000s of people; and the trends.

The ABS July unemployment estimate shows 801,000 (6.3%, up 0.2% from June) Australians are now unemployed. This is the highest ABS unemployment figure since July 1997  so the ABS estimates are finally moving in the right direction in terms of accuracy. However, it creates another problem  the trend, or direction. Unemployment is not increasing, it is actually improving but there is a still a gross under-estimate of real Australian unemployment. The latest Roy Morgan July unemployment estimate (1,097,000, 8.7%) shows nearly 300,000 more unemployed Australians are ignored by the ABS  and by extension the Productivity Commission in its Workplace Relations Framework draft report.

Because of the way the ABS unemployment estimate is calculated  the ABS interviews the same people (known as rotation groups) over a rolling eight month period and uses a 'tighter' definition of how to classify a member of the workforce as unemployed  there is a definite 'lag period' between when a worker is made unemployed and when they will show up as unemployed according to the ABS. In contrast the Roy Morgan estimates are estimated on more of a 'real-time' basis with a large sample of different Australians interviewed each month.

In addition to the under-stated unemployment estimates the ABS monthly unemployment estimate also conspicuously ignores the high level of Australian under-employment  the latest Roy Morgan July under-employment estimate shows a further 977,000 Australians (7.7%) are under-employed. Taken together this means a massive 2.07 million Australians (16.4%) are now unemployed or under-employed. Australian unemployment and under-employment has now been above 2 million Australians for 44 straight months  more than 3  years.

This is not a surprise to the Australian people. On every occasion Roy Morgan has asked the Australian people a simple question: ""The ABS Unemployment rate in (month) was x%. The Roy Morgan estimate for (month) was y%. Which do you believe is closer to reality?""  Australians have consistently confirmed they believe the Roy Morgan unemployment estimate is 'closer to reality': In April 2015: a clear majority of Australians (60%) said Roy Morgan's estimate was 'closer to reality' compared to 29% who said the ABS estimate was 'closer to reality' while 11% couldn't say.

Since March this year (the largest gap between the Roy Morgan and ABS unemployment estimates this year) the ABS unemployment estimate has increased from 6.1% (765,000) to 6.3% (801,000) in July  an increase of 36,000 (0.2%).

During the same time period Roy Morgan unemployment has dropped from 10.8% (1,368,000) in March to 8.7% (1,097,000) in July  a fall of 271,000 (2.1%). Roy Morgan under-employment is virtually unchanged during the same period  976,000 (7.7%) in March and now 977,000 (7.7%) in July.

The biggest driver of the falling Roy Morgan unemployment rate over the last few months has been the increase in full-time employment  now at 7,900,000 in July (up 314,000 since March) while part-time employment is now 3,676,000 (down 40,000 since March). In fact, full-time employment is now at a record high. These trends show that although both unemployment and under-employment remain very high in Australia, the economy is now generating full-time jobs to replace those lost in the mining industry.

The fall in Australian unemployment shown by Roy Morgan in recent months isn't surprising when one considers the stimulus provided by lower interest rates, lower oil prices, higher beef and primary agricultural export prices; and a lower Australian Dollar. The Australian Dollar has spent most of 2015 below 80 US cents and has now dropped below 75 US cents for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis in early 2009  over six years ago. The fall in the Australian Dollar has provided a huge boost to exporting industries in Australia including tourism, manufacturing, education and agriculture which are all stimulated by the fall in the Australian Dollar. The obvious exception to this boost is the mining industry which is dealing with a slowdown in its biggest export market  China.

Consumer Confidence is another important indicator  generally if unemployment goes down one can expect Consumer Confidence to increase. But today the ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence Rating of 112.5 is depressed by people's concern about a 'dysfunctional' Federal Government and Opposition  a Roy Morgan Government Confidence Rating of 86 says a lot! In addition the latest Roy Morgan survey results (July 2015) show neither Prime Minister Tony Abbott (approval 34% cf. disapproval 59%) nor Opposition Leader Bill Shorten (approval 24% cf. disapproval 60%) enjoy community approval for their job performance.

Consequences of relying on inaccurate employment estimates

The problem caused by relying on inaccurate employment estimates provided by the ABS is that the policies formulated in response  and reports like the Productivity Commission Workplace Relations Framework draft report  don't provide the correct solutions to the real problem.

For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) currently has Australian interest rates (at 2%) amongst the highest in the developed world despite Australian unemployment being considerably higher than US unemployment (US interest rates are currently under 0.25%) and of course our Federal Parliamentarians and the Federal Government of the day rely on this data to formulate policy.

Decisions about Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) that will endure forever and have a significant and enduring impact on the Australian economy must be informed by accurate information about our workforce.

If you're going by the numbers  make sure they're the right numbers!

 Unfortunately, although the ABS under-estimates of unemployment allow the Government of the day to give themselves a 'pat on the back' about their employment related policies, they also help restrict and prevent the Government, in this case the Abbott Government, from enacting the comprehensive and decisive workplace reforms that the more than 2 million Australians looking for work really need.

The cash economy

Accurate data must be sought on the cash economy. A typical piece in the 'productivity landscape' of any economy is the cash economy  that segment that sits uncomfortably between 'unemployment' and 'legally paid employment' (part-time or full-time) and the illegal workforce. Within the Productivity Commission's entire draft report  of over 1,000 pages  the Commission only refers to the Australian 'cash economy' once. ONCE!

""It should be noted that there may be circumstances when people priced out of 'employee' labour markets due to minimum wage laws are not priced out of labour markets more generally. Such people may take up self employed or contractor roles, or informal jobs where workers are paid 'cash in hand' or 'in kind' (as in the case of a live in housekeeper or nanny), which avoid the need to be paid at the rate of the minimum wage. Jobs such as housekeeping, household maintenance and care work appear particularly amenable to these arrangements. Activities within the illicit economy also provide alternatives some people may take where they are priced out of the formal labour market.""

In contrast to the Productivity Commission's decision to all but ignore the Australian 'cash economy' there are tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Australians who work in the cash economy every day, and their employers avoid all the attendant costs and red tape that go with properly adhering to employment laws. Superannuation costs, differing penalty rates, the costs associated with employing PAYE (Pay As You Earn) employees and other general employment costs are all avoided by employers who prefer to employ a certain percentage of their staff by way of 'cash-in-hand' employment.

In particular this is a huge problem in the restaurant and caf industry and amongst blue-collar tradesmen who do home renovations for cash. Many service staff in restaurants and cafes are employed 'cash-in-hand' and encouraged to supplement their income via tips and gratuities from customers. Given the large proportion of itinerant and foreign workers that are employed in this industry on a short-term basis this is a widespread problem throughout this industry. The restaurants and cafes employing 'cash-in-hand' service staff have a real and measurable detrimental impact on businesses that employ responsibly and follow the law of the land.

There is a similar problem with employment relating to unpaid interns who provide 'free work' for employers with the hopeful prospect of attaining a paying job at some point in the future. The abuse of the unpaid interns is another way unscrupulous businesses are able to unfairly lower their costs and this in turn impacts on businesses that pay their employees a fair wage as they deserve.

Conclusion

The Productivity Commission Workplace Relations Framework draft report is a step in the right direction  however, its conclusions would have a stronger grounding if they were backed up by relying upon the real picture of the Australian labour force and the robust employment estimates provided by the Roy Morgan real unemployment and under-employment figures.

By relying on 'politically tailored' figures that aren't grounded in reality the Productivity Commission, along with other policymakers including the RBA and the Federal Government, do not respond in the urgent fashion required by the more than 2 million Australians who are now unemployed or under-employed. It is no good for the millions of Australians looking for work that their search for gainful employment is not sufficiently recognised to be given the priority it deserves by senior policymakers.

Simply put - unemployed and under-employed Australians deserve better, and they deserve real solutions now  not in 18 months or five years.

Villagers told authorities they saw the plane crash into a mountain, some 33 minutes after it had taken off.

Indonesia's air transportation director general, Suprasetyo, confirmed the wreckage had been located at a news conference.

Suprasetyo was appointed in January this year at the time of the disappearance of an AirAsia flight with 162 people on board. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said at the time the AirAsia the crash had exposed widespread problems in the management of air transportation in Indonesia.

Meantime the Trigana Air Service ATR 42-300 plane has been located  in the Oktabe district of Papua province, Suprasetyo said. Details were still being verified he said, adding no information had been received as to whether there had been any survivors.

The Trigano Air flight TGN267  left Sentani Airport in Jayapura at 2:22 p.m. and was scheduled to land in Oksibil at about 3:16pm officials said.

The plane lost contact at about 2:55pm., Transportation Ministry spokesman J.A. Barata told CNN Indonesia.

It was understood no distress call had been made by the plane before its disappearance.

A search-and-rescue operation by the National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) was initiated but was suspended due to fog and bad weather which made the continuation of the search hazardous.

The plane had 54 people on the board, comprising 49 passengers, which including five children and infants, and five crew members.

With the Trigana Air Service loss, three Asian airlines have now lost a total of 4 planes in the past eighteen month. Malaysian Airlines lost MH 370 and MH17, while the AirAsia plane which had departed Surabaya, Indonesia for Singapore in January, crashed in the Java Sea. 

Trigana Air Service is one of a large number of airlines banned from operating in European airspace due to safety concerns. The ban relating to Trigana has been in place for the past eight years.

In the wake of the AirAsia crash in January, Indonesia suspended 61 flights from five airlines which did not hold valid permits for flying from the country. The transport ministry also suspended 11 officials for negligence and conducted audits at five airports.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/946627718730984/?type=3,2015-08-16 13:58:45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_946350722092017,"The siege of Knightsbridge is both an emblem of gross injustice and a gruelling farce. For three years, a police cordon around the Ecuadorean embassy in London has served no purpose other than to flaunt the power of the state. It has cost 12 million pounds ($18 million). The quarry is an Australian charged with no crime, a refugee whose only security is the room given him by a brave South American country. His ""crime"" is to have initiated a wave of truth-telling in an era of lies, cynicism and war.

The persecution of Julian Assange is about to flare again as it enters a dangerous stage. From August 20, three quarters of the Swedish prosecutor's case against Assange regarding sexual misconduct in 2010 will disappear as the statute of limitations expires. At the same time Washington's obsession with Assange and WikiLeaks has intensified. Indeed, it is vindictive American power that offers the greatest threat - as Chelsea Manning and those still held in Guantanamo can attest.

The Americans are pursuing Assange because WikiLeaks exposed their epic crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq: the wholesale killing of tens of thousands of civilians, which they covered up, and their contempt for sovereignty and international law, as demonstrated vividly in their leaked diplomatic cables. WikiLeaks continues to expose criminal activity by the US, having just published top secret US intercepts - US spies' reports detailing private phone calls of the presidents of France and Germany, and other senior officials, relating to internal European political and economic affairs.

None of this is illegal under the US Constitution. As a presidential candidate in 2008, Barack Obama, a professor of constitutional law, lauded whistleblowers as ""part of a healthy democracy [and they] must be protected from reprisal"". In 2012, the campaign to re-elect President Barack Obama boasted on its website that he had prosecuted more whistleblowers in his first term than all other US presidents combined. Before Chelsea Manning had even received a trial, Obama had pronounced the whistleblower guilty. He was subsequently sentenced to 35 years in prison, having been tortured during his long pre-trial detention.

Few doubt that should the US get their hands on Assange, a similar fate awaits him. Threats of the capture and assassination of Assange became the currency of the political extremes in the US following Vice-President Joe Biden's preposterous slur that the WikiLeaks founder was a ""cyber-terrorist"". Those doubting the degree of ruthlessness Assange can expect should remember the forcing down of the Bolivian president's plane in 2013 - wrongly believed to be carrying Edward Snowden.

According to documents released by Snowden, Assange is on a ""Manhunt target list"". Washington's bid to get him, say Australian diplomatic cables, is ""unprecedented in scale and nature"". In Alexandria, Virginia, a secret grand jury has spent five years attempting to contrive a crime for which Assange can be prosecuted. This is not easy. The First Amendment to the US Constitution protects publishers, journalists and whistleblowers.

Faced with this constitutional hurdle, the US Justice Department has contrived charges of ""espionage"", ""conspiracy to commit espionage"", ""conversion"" (theft of government property), ""computer fraud and abuse"" (computer hacking) and general ""conspiracy"". The Espionage Act has life in prison and death penalty provisions.

Assange's ability to defend himself in this Kafkaesque world has been handicapped by the US declaring his case a state secret. In March, a federal court in Washington blocked the release of all information about the ""national security"" investigation against WikiLeaks, because it was ""active and ongoing"" and would harm the ""pending prosecution"" of Assange. The judge, Barbara J. Rosthstein, said it was necessary to show ""appropriate deference to the executive in matters of national security"". Such is the ""justice"" of a kangaroo court.

The supporting act in this grim farce is Sweden, played by the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny. Until recently, Ny refused to comply with a routine European procedure routine that required her to travel to London to question Assange and so advance the case. For four and a half years, Ny has never properly explained why she has refused to come to London, just as the Swedish authorities have never explained why they refuse to give Assange a guarantee that they will not extradite him on to the US under a secret arrangement agreed between Stockholm and Washington. In December 2010, The Independent revealed that the two governments had discussed his onward extradition to the US.

Contrary to its 1960s reputation as a liberal bastion, Sweden has drawn so close to Washington that it has allowed secret CIA ""renditions"" - including the illegal deportation of refugees. The rendition and subsequent torture of two Egyptian political refugees in 2001 was condemned by the UN Committee against Torture, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch; the complicity and duplicity of the Swedish state are documented in successful civil litigation and in WikiLeaks cables. In the summer of 2010, Assange had flown to Sweden to talk about WikiLeaks revelations of the war in Afghanistan - in which Sweden had forces under US command.

""Documents released by WikiLeaks since Assange moved to England,"" wrote Al Burke, editor of the online Nordic News Network, an authority on the multiple twists and dangers facing Assange, ""clearly indicate that Sweden has consistently submitted to pressure from the United States in matters relating to civil rights. There is every reason for concern that if Assange were to be taken into custody by Swedish authorities, he could be turned over to the United States without due consideration of his legal rights.""

Why hasn't the Swedish prosecutor resolved the Assange case? Many in the legal community in Sweden believe her behaviour inexplicable. Once implacably hostile to Assange, the Swedish press has published headlines such as: ""Go to London, for God's sake.""

Why hasn't she? More to the point, why won't she allow the Swedish court access to hundreds of SMS messages that the police extracted from the phone of one of the two women involved in the misconduct allegations? Why won't she hand them over to Assange's Swedish lawyers? She says she is not legally required to do so until a formal charge is laid and she has questioned him. Then, why doesn't she question him? And if she did question him, the conditions she would demand of him and his lawyers - that they could not challenge her - would make injustice a near certainty.

On a point of law, the Swedish Supreme Court has decided Ny can continue to obstruct on the vital issue of the SMS messages. This will now go to the European Court of Human Rights. What Ny fears is that the SMS messages will destroy her case against Assange. One of the messages makes clear that one of the women did not want any charges brought against Assange, ""but the police were keen on getting a hold on him"". She was ""shocked"" when they arrested him because she only ""wanted him to take [an HIV] test"". She ""did not want to accuse JA of anything"" and ""it was the police who made up the charges"". (In a witness statement, she is quoted as saying that she had been ""railroaded by police and others around her"".)

Neither woman claimed she had been raped. Indeed, both have denied they were raped and one of them has since tweeted, ""I have not been raped."" That they were manipulated by police and their wishes ignored is evident - whatever their lawyers might say now. Certainly, they are victims of a saga which blights the reputation of Sweden itself.

For Assange, his only trial has been trial by media. On August 20, 2010, the Swedish police opened a ""rape investigation"" and immediately - and unlawfully - told the Stockholm tabloids that there was a warrant for Assange's arrest for the ""rape of two women"". This was the news that went round the world.

In Washington, a smiling US Defence Secretary Robert Gates told reporters that the arrest ""sounds like good news to me"". Twitter accounts associated with the Pentagon described Assange as a ""rapist"" and a ""fugitive"".

Less than 24 hours later, the Stockholm Chief Prosecutor, Eva Finne, took over the investigation. She wasted no time in cancelling the arrest warrant, saying, ""I don't believe there is any reason to suspect that he has committed rape."" Four days later, she dismissed the rape investigation altogether, saying, ""There is no suspicion of any crime whatsoever."" The file was closed.

Enter Claes Borgstrom, a high profile politician in the Social Democratic Party then standing as a candidate in Sweden's imminent general election. Within days of the chief prosecutor's dismissal of the case, Borgstrom, a lawyer, announced to the media that he was representing the two women and had sought a different prosecutor in the city of Gothenberg. This was Marianne Ny, whom Borgstrom knew well, personally and politically.

On 30 August, Assange attended a police station in Stockholm voluntarily and answered all the questions put to him. He understood that was the end of the matter. Two days later, Ny announced she was re-opening the case. Borgstrom was asked by a Swedish reporter why the case was proceeding when it had already been dismissed, citing one of the women as saying she had not been raped. He replied, ""Ah, but she is not a lawyer."" Assange's Australian barrister, James Catlin, responded, ""This is a laughing stock... it's as if they make it up as they go along.""

On the day Marianne Ny reactivated the case, the head of Sweden's military intelligence service - which has the acronym MUST -- publicly denounced WikiLeaks in an article entitled ""WikiLeaks [is] a threat to our soldiers."" Assange was warned that the Swedish intelligence service, SAPO, had been told by its US counterparts that US-Sweden intelligence-sharing arrangements would be ""cut off"" if Sweden sheltered him.

For five weeks, Assange waited in Sweden for the new investigation to take its course. The Guardian was then on the brink of publishing the Iraq ""War Logs"", based on WikiLeaks' disclosures, which Assange was to oversee. His lawyer in Stockholm asked Ny if she had any objection to his leaving the country. She said he was free to leave.

Inexplicably, as soon as he left Sweden - at the height of media and public interest in the WikiLeaks disclosures - Ny issued a European Arrest Warrant and an Interpol ""red alert"" normally used for terrorists and dangerous criminals. Put out in five languages around the world, it ensured a media frenzy.

Assange attended a police station in London, was arrested and spent ten days in Wandsworth Prison, in solitary confinement. Released on 340,000 bail, he was electronically tagged, required to report to police daily and placed under virtual house arrest while his case began its long journey to the Supreme Court. He still had not been charged with any offence. His lawyers repeated his offer to be questioned by Ny in London, pointing out that she had given him permission to leave Sweden. They suggested a special facility at Scotland Yard commonly used for that purpose. She refused.

Katrin Axelsson and Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape wrote: ""The allegations against [Assange] are a smokescreen behind which a number of governments are trying to clamp down on WikiLeaks for having audaciously revealed to the public their secret planning of wars and occupations with their attendant rape, murder and destruction... The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will. [Assange] has made it clear he is available for questioning by the Swedish authorities, in Britain or via Skype. Why are they refusing this essential step in their investigation? What are they afraid of?""

This question remained unanswered as Ny deployed the European Arrest Warrant, a draconian and now discredited  product of the ""war on terror"" supposedly designed to catch terrorists and organised criminals. The EAW had abolished the obligation on a petitioning state to provide any evidence of a crime. More than a thousand EAWs are issued each month; only a few have anything to do with potential ""terror"" charges. Most are issued for trivial offences, such as overdue bank charges and fines. Many of those extradited face months in prison without charge. There have been a number of shocking miscarriages of justice, of which British judges have been highly critical.

The Assange case finally reached the UK Supreme Court in May 2012. In a judgement that upheld the EAW - whose rigid demands had left the courts almost no room for manoeuvre - the judges found that European prosecutors could issue extradition warrants in the UK without any judicial oversight, even though Parliament intended otherwise. They made clear that Parliament had been ""misled"" by the Blair government. The court was split, 5-2, and consequently found against Assange.

However, the Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, made one mistake. He applied the Vienna Convention on treaty interpretation, allowing for state practice to override the letter of the law. As Assange's barrister, Dinah Rose QC, pointed out, this did not apply to the EAW.

The Supreme Court only recognised this crucial error when it dealt with another appeal against the EAW in November 2013. The Assange decision had been wrong, but it was too late to go back. With extradition imminent, the Swedish prosecutor told Assange's lawyers that Assange, once in Sweden, would be immediately placed in one of Sweden's infamous remand prisons.

Assange's choice was stark: extradition to a country that had refused to say whether or not it would send him on to the US, or to seek what seemed his last opportunity for refuge and safety. Supported by most of Latin America, the courageous government of Ecuador granted him refugee status on the basis of documented evidence and legal advice that he faced the prospect of cruel and unusual punishment in the US; that this threat violated his basic human rights; and that his own government in Australia had abandoned him and colluded with Washington. The Labor government of prime minister Julia Gillard had even threatened to take away his passport.

Gareth Peirce, the renowned human rights lawyer who represents Assange in London, wrote to the then Australian foreign minister, Kevin Rudd: ""Given the extent of the public discussion, frequently on the basis of entirely false assumptions... it is very hard to attempt to preserve for him any presumption of innocence. Mr. Assange has now hanging over him not one but two Damocles swords, of potential extradition to two different jurisdictions in turn for two different alleged crimes, neither of which are crimes in his own country, and that his personal safety has become at risk in circumstances that are highly politically charged.""

It was not until she contacted the Australian High Commission in London that Peirce received a response, which answered none of the pressing points she raised. In a meeting I attended with her, the Australian Consul-General, Ken Pascoe, made the astonishing claim that he knew ""only what I read in the newspapers"" about the details of the case.

Meanwhile, the prospect of a grotesque miscarriage of justice was drowned in a vituperative campaign against the WikiLeaks founder. Deeply personal, petty, vicious and inhuman attacks were aimed at a man not charged with any crime yet subjected to treatment not even meted out to a defendant facing extradition on a charge of murdering his wife. That the US threat to Assange was a threat to all journalists, to freedom of speech, was lost in the sordid and the ambitious.

Books were published, movie deals struck and media careers launched or kick-started on the back of WikiLeaks and an assumption that attacking Assange was fair game and he was too poor to sue. People have made money, often big money, while WikiLeaks has struggled to survive. The editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, called the WikiLeaks disclosures, which his newspaper published, ""one of the greatest journalistic scoops of the last 30 years"". It became part of his marketing plan to raise the newspaper's cover price.

With not a penny going to Assange or to WikiLeaks, a hyped Guardian book led to a lucrative Hollywood movie. The book's authors, Luke Harding and David Leigh, gratuitously described Assange as a ""damaged personality"" and ""callous"". They also revealed the secret password he had given the paper in confidence, which was designed to protect a digital file containing the US embassy cables. With Assange now trapped in the Ecuadorean embassy, Harding, standing among the police outside, gloated on his blog that ""Scotland Yard may get the last laugh"".

The injustice meted out to Assange is one of the reasons Parliament reformed the Extradition Act to prevent the misuse of the EAW. The draconian catch-all used against him could not happen now; charges would have to be brought and ""questioning"" would be insufficient grounds for extradition. ""His case has been won lock, stock and barrel,"" Gareth Peirce told me, ""these changes in the law mean that the UK now recognises as correct everything that was argued in his case. Yet he does not benefit."" In other words, the change in the UK law in 2014 mean that Assange would have won his case and he would not have been forced to take refuge.

Ecuador's decision to protect Assange in 2012 bloomed into a major international affair. Even though the granting of asylum is a humanitarian act, and the power to do so is enjoyed by all states under international law, both Sweden and the United Kingdom refused to recognize the legitimacy of Ecuador's decision. Ignoring international law, the Cameron government refused to grant Assange safe passage to Ecuador. Instead, Ecuador's embassy was placed under siege and its government abused with a series of ultimatums. When William Hague's Foreign Office threatened to violate the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, warning that it would remove the diplomatic inviolability of the embassy and send the police in to get Assange, outrage across the world forced the government to back down. During one night, police appeared at the windows of the embassy in an obvious attempt to intimidate Assange and his protectors.

Since then, Julian Assange has been confined to a small room under Ecuador's protection, without sunlight or space to exercise, surrounded by police under orders to arrest him on sight. For three years, Ecuador has made clear to the Swedish prosecutor that Assange is available to be questioned in the London embassy, and for three years she has remained intransigent. In the same period Sweden has questioned forty-four people in the UK in connection with police investigations. Her role, and that of the Swedish state, is demonstrably political; and for Ny, facing retirement in two years, she must ""win"".

In despair, Assange has challenged the arrest warrant in the Swedish courts. His lawyers have cited rulings by the European Court of Human Rights that he has been under arbitrary, indefinite detention and that he had been a virtual prisoner for longer than any actual prison sentence he might face. The Court of Appeal judge agreed with Assange's lawyers: the prosecutor had indeed breached her duty by keeping the case suspended for years. Another judge issued a rebuke to the prosecutor. And yet she defied the court.

Last December, Assange took his case to the Swedish Supreme Court, which ordered Marianne Ny's boss - the Prosecutor General of Sweden Anders Perklev - to explain. The next day, Ny announced, without explanation, that she had changed her mind and would now question Assange in London.

In his submission to the Supreme Court, the Prosecutor General made some important concessions: he argued that the coercion of Assange had been ""intrusive"" and that that the period in the embassy has been a ""great strain"" on him. He even conceded that if the matter had ever come to prosecution, trial, conviction and serving a sentence in Sweden, Julian Assange would have left Sweden long ago.

In a split decision, one Supreme Court judge argued that the arrest warrant should have been revoked. The majority of the judges ruled that, since the prosecutor had now said she would go to London, Assange's arguments had become ""moot"". But the Court ruled that it would have found against the prosecutor if she had not suddenly changed her mind. Justice by caprice. Writing in the Swedish press, a former Swedish prosecutor, Rolf Hillegren, accused Ny of losing all impartiality. He described her personal investment in the case as""abnormal"" and demanded that she be replaced.

Having said she would go to London in June, Ny did not go, but sent a deputy, knowing that the questioning would not be legal under these circumstances, especially as Sweden had not bothered to get Ecuador's approval for the meeting. At the same time, her office tipped off the Swedish tabloid newspaper Expressen, which sent its London correspondent to wait outside Ecuador's embassy for ""news"". The news was that Ny was cancelling the appointment and blaming Ecuador for the confusion and by implication an ""uncooperative"" Assange - when the opposite was true.

As the statute of limitations date approaches - 20 August 2015 - another chapter in this hideous story will doubtless unfold, with Marianne Ny pulling yet another rabbit out of her hat and the commissars and prosecutors in Washington the beneficiaries. Perhaps none of this is surprising. In 2008, a war on WikiLeaks and on Julian Assange was foretold in a secret Pentagon document prepared by the ""Cyber Counterintelligence Assessments Branch"". It described a detailed plan to destroy the feeling of ""trust"" which is WikiLeaks' ""centre of gravity"". This would be achieved with threats of ""exposure [and] criminal prosecution"". Silencing and criminalising such a rare source of truth-telling was the aim, smear the method. While this scandal continues the very notion of justice is diminished, along with the reputation of Sweden, and the shadow of America's menace touches us all.

109808052412959_945666148827141,"Scientists in the US have found that a feel-good exercise hormone called irisin does indeed exists in humans, putting to bed long-disputed claims that it is a myth.

The research team, led by Bruce Spiegelman from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, used mass spectrometry to look for irisin in blood samples of individuals after exercise, finding that these people had released the exercise hormone from their body, which activates fat cells to increase energy turn over.

The research was published today in the journal Cell Metabolism.

""Concentrations are present in sedentary individuals and are significantly increased in individuals undergoing aerobic interval training,"" the researchers said in the paper.

""We therefore also confirm our earlier report of irisin being regulated by endurance exercise in humans.""

Irisin received a lot of attention recently because of divisions in the scientific community about whether or not it actually existed.

Irisin's discovery in 2012 was exciting because scientists had potentially found one reason why exercise keeps us healthy.

When irisin levels were increased in mice, their blood and metabolism improved. Results from human studies are still mixed as to what kinds of exercise raise irisin, but data suggest that high-intensity training protocols are particularly effective.

Professor Mark Febbraio, Head of the Cellular and Molecular Metabolism Laboratory and Head of the Diabetes and Metabolism Division at the Garvan Institute for Medical Research, said that the form of mass spectrometry used in the new study was far more accurate and reliable in measuring irisin.

""Using state-of-the-art technology, the researchers have proven beyond doubt that irisin is real. It settles the argument,"" said Professor Febbraio, who was not involved in the research.

Previous studies using commercially available kits called ""ELISA"" kits detected the presence of irisin, by recognising an antigen, in samples, which could produce inconsistent results with irisin, he said.

A pathway to benefits for other ailments

Febbraio said confirming the existence of irisin is a step towards potentially developing therapeutics that could benefit individuals with metabolic disease and obesity.

""There is a possibility they could make drugs that target the pathways that are activated by irisin"" to produce similar affects of exercise on maintaining body weight, particularly for those who can't exercise, he said.

However, he is sceptical about irisin being turned into a miracle injection, saying such a product would be ""somewhat simplistic and fanciful"".

At this stage further studies are necessary to fully understand how the hormone works in humans, specifically how it relates to brown and beige fat tissue and energy use but it is an important breakthrough.

""It is basically another example that exercise can have multiple benefits to general health and wellbeing,"" said Febbraio.

Dr Paul Lee, a research officer at the Garvan Institute who specialises in endocrinology, described the finding as ""a remarkable step forward.""

""The study shows that irisin circulates in humans and it increases after exercise. What awaits exploration in future studies is the biological function of irisin in humans,"" he said.

109808052412959_945203585540064,"SYDNEY, Australia - NRL stars Valentine Holmes, Michael Lichaa and Shaun Lane have urged the rugby league community to rally behind the Unite for Kurt Round this weekend, a fundraising initiative for their good friend and former teammate Kurt Drysdale, who suffered a serious neck injury in June.

The VB NSW Cup, Ron Massey Cup, Sydney Shield competitions and greater New South Wales Rugby League family, including the Cronulla Sharks, will ""Unite for Kurt"" across this weekend (15-16 August) and beyond, with monies raised going directly to cater for Kurt's ongoing care.

Kurt, a Sharks district junior and former Endeavour High School student, who turned 21 just over a week ago, is in the Royal North Shore Hospital, paralysed from the neck down after he was injured playing for Cabramatta in the Sydney Shield.

Cabramatta players will wear specially-designed Unite for Kurt jerseys during their Ron Massey Cup and Sydney Shield matches at New Era Stadium on Saturday, with players' jerseys to be sold for $250 each with proceeds going directly to Kurt.

Kurt's Dad, Steven, and his sister Skye, 27, will attend the Cabramatta matches this weekend.

""I haven't gone out of my way to watch rugby league since the accident but Kurt still loves the game and watches as many games as he can over the weekend as well as old Endeavour school games he played in,"" Steven said.

Steven and his wife Sonya, who can spend two to three hours a day travelling from their home at Stanwell Park (Illawarra region) to be with him at the hospital in Sydney's lower north shore, said they are overwhelmed by the support they have received from the rugby league community, family, friends and even complete strangers across Australia and overseas.

""It's hard to keep up. There is so much going on it's overwhelming,"" Steven said. ""We are really appreciative of the support we have received and for events like the Unite for Kurt Round this weekend.""

Steven said Kurt has made some positive progress but is still not able to breathe without assistance.

Kurt's former Sharks under-20 team-mates and current NRL players - Valentine Holmes (Sharks) and Shaun Lane and Michael Lichaa (Bulldogs) - said it was great to see the rugby league community and the general public get behind Kurt and his family.

""It'll mean a lot to see everyone get behind him  every little bit of support he can get will mean the world,"" said Holmes.

""Hopefully at our home game on Monday night the whole Shire can get behind the Unite for Kurt fundraising effort and help us to a win  I know he'd like that.""

Close friend Shaun Lane said it was great to see the rugby league community and the general public get behind Kurt and his family.

""I first met Kurt in school rep footy when I was 11, and we went to the same high school at Endeavour and I played with him there in the junior reps at Cronulla,"" Lane said.

""I was with him most afternoons, he's one of my best mates. He's a great bloke, a really rare person nowadays who's so kind-hearted and selfless  no-one would ever say a bad word about him. It's a very sad thing what's happened to him.

""I know he and his family are very happy with everyone getting behind him and all the fundraising from the rugby league community and the general public  they really appreciate it and are very grateful.""

Another former team-mate in Lichaa has called on the entire rugby league community to get behind his mate.

""It's pretty tragic what happened to him but hopefully everyone can get behind him through the Unite for Kurt Round and support him and his family as best as possible,"" Lichaa said.

""Hopefully we can get a smile on his face.

""The Cabra jersey, it's a cool design, I hope he likes it and I hope the boys who wear it on the weekend go out and do him proud.""

In addition to the NSWRL competitions' Unite for Kurt Round where clubs hosting matches will support the cause through gold-coin entry fees, match-fee donations and game-day raffles, there are many other fundraising efforts occurring in the wider rugby league community.

NRL club Cronulla Sharks are dedicating their 17 August (Monday) clash with the Storm to the Unite for Kurt fundraising effort, with ticket specials and coin collections. A host of rugby league identities including Stuart Raper, Ben Ross, Chris Quinn, Darryl Brohman, Jeff Hardy, Aaron Raper and Robbie Kearns will take part in a Heathcote to Remondis Stadium game-day walk with proceeds going directly to Kurt's care.

The Illawarra Cutters, in conjunction with St George Illawarra Dragons, the Illawarra Division and the Illawarra Referees Association, have already completed a number of fundraising efforts including player and staff donation days, bucket collections and memorabilia items.

Wests Ashfield Leagues Club will host a fundraising dinner on Thursday, September 24, featuring Warren Smith as MC, Dave Faulkner from the Hoodoo Gurus and other special guests including Phil Gould, Jason Taylor and more. Tickets are $200 from westsashfield.com.au.

Cabramatta will also host a function later this month, with a sportsmen's function on August 22 featuring guest speakers including NSW VB Blues coach Laurie Daley, the auctioning of memorabilia items and other drawcards.

A day later the Jim Owens Running Group, based out of Helensburgh just south of Sydney, will brand the Woronora Dam Pipeline Run in Kurt's honour. Runners taking on the course will include Kurt's dad and brother, Blake. Once again all money raised will go directly to Kurt's care.

All past and future funds that are raised for Kurt Drysdale should be deposited into the following bank account:

109808052412959_929400633787026,"Australian media is continuing its frenzy over the Alex Mckinnon and Cameron Smith stoush which has deeply affected the two men, their families, friends and supporters.

""How could 60 minutes get it so wrong?"" ""Chasing the headlines on Alex McKinnon and Cameron Smith, 60 Minutes has devastated two families."" These were screaming headlines splashed over News Corp newspapers on Saturday, pushing the story to the No. 1 ranked story on the Daily Telegraph and Advertiser websites.

""One of the most irresponsible pieces of journalism ever to have aired on the 60 Minutes program has left two men shattered, two families devastated and both unnecessarily defending themselves in the light of a dreadful human tragedy,"" Rebecca Wilson at The Daily Telegraph penned.

The story rips into Channel 9 accusing Australia's oldest telecaster of 'gross oversight' in including the segment in the story, particularly without giving Smith a right of reply. The channel's subsequent offer on the Monday was simply a move to 'perpetuate the ratings,' Wilson wrote.
""When sensationalism gets in the way of the truth, the damage to all sides is enormous and public opinion falls victim to a lack of facts,"" the article said.

Nothing could be more true. But the cause has not been simply Channel 9 and 60 Minutes alone. Most of Australia has been captivated and inspired by the magnificent love story that unfolded in a sensitively approached program that included comments about Cameron Smith and his reaction to the tackle that crippled Alex McKinnon as a very minor part of the story. It was not highlighted on the program, nor was it promoted in the lead up to the program going to air. It is the Australian media that jumped on the segment and sensationalized it. And The Daily Telegraph which has published Sunday's stinging attack on Nine is just as culpable as anyone else.

To be fair to 60 Minutes, they had no control over the aftermath that followed their show, nor did they use the Smith comments to promote their program prior to airing it. Their trailers which began running at least from June 17 2015, and which at times ran up to one minute and 38 seconds, didn't even display a glimpse of the Cameron Smith comments. As far as the program was concerned it was not they that were seeking a headline to promote their show.

The Sunday Telegraph in fact began the chain of events, with a domino-collapsing story in last week's edition which was published well before the 60 Minutes story was aired.

""Alex McKinnon slams ""disgusting"" Test captain Cameron Smith over tackle slur,"" was the headline. ""Alex McKinnon has described as ""disgusting"" personal blame directed at him from people he ""once had great respect for"" including Test captain Cameron Smith,"" the story began. It goes on to point out McKinnon was accusing Smith of blaming him for the tackle which left him facing life in a wheelchair. The article says McKinnon is still furious that Smith argued with the referee and that he has not heard from Smith since.

This article is written by David Riccio who happens to be the co-author of Alex's forthcoming book 'Unbroken.' Excerpts of the story began being published this same weekend. A week earlier the Daily Telegraph had reported ""Here is the first look at one of the most anticipated sports autobiography's of the year. There is also content within the book which will rock the rugby league world."" The headline was ""McKinnon pulls no punches.""

It should be noted that on the morning of the day News Corp published this and another related story (last Sunday), the Melbourne Storm issued a statement in response. Firstly the club said its thoughts and best wishes remain with Alex for his continued recovery, and noted his story continues to inspire the rugby league community. It then sets out a number of points:

1. At the time of this tragic accident, no one on the field had any idea of the severity of the injury Alex had suffered. All at Storm and especially the playing group were shocked and horrified to learn of Alex's injuries in the days after the event;
2. Storm players led by captain Cameron Smith requested to visit Alex in hospital numerous times while he was in Melbourne. The requests were declined which was totally understandable given Alex needed to focus on the initial stages of his recovery;
3. Storm's Football Director continued to liaise with his Newcastle equivalent regarding the right time for club players to contact Alex in the weeks and months after the incident;
4. Cameron Smith was proud to launch the riseforalex round last year alongside Paul Gallen, as well as to wear Alex's jersey number at Storm's game in Melbourne in the same round. Storm's fans raised more than $20,000 for Alex that day alone.

""Storm sincerely wishes Alex and his family all the absolute best for his continued recovery,"" the statement concluded.

Despite this statement and most of social media's focus on the inspirational aspects of the 60 Minutes story, Australian media outlets, including the nation's major metropolitan dailies, television and radio networks on Monday were ablaze with acrimonious and bitter responses including op-eds that took aim mainly at Smith, but also at McKinnon. The story gained traction, particularly as it came ahead of the State of Origin Decider on the Wednesday night. Australia's various media outlets couldn't get enough of it.

""Alex McKinnon blasts Cameron Smith in 60 Minutes interview,"" Matt Bungard wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald. ""60 Minutes didn't approach Cameron Smith to respond to Alex McKinnon's criticism,"" Paul Crawley wrote in The Daily Telegraph.

At 8:29am on Monday, hours after the 60 Minutes program had aired, News Corp was adding fuel to the fire saying on News.com.au, ""In further developments that are set to rock the Maroons just two days out from the decider, extracts from McKinnon's soon to be released book Unbroken reveal the depth of anger he carries toward Smith since the incident more than 12 months ago.""

""McKinnon makes it clear in extracts from his book that his anger towards Smith stems from comments made on the field that the ducking of his head contributed to the injury,"" the story continued.

The article quotes excerpts from the book which has yet to be released:
""But if my dream had come true to captain Australia, I know I would've had the decency to at least get in touch with someone in my situation via a phone call or text message after the accident, especially if I had witnessed the distressing scenario with my own eyes.""

""That's the type person I am.""

""I have not heard from the person claiming ""It's all my fault"" once since the accident,"" McKinnon writes in his book.

""The Australian captain heard my screams and surely he would've noticed the white terror on my face.""

While Rebecca Wilson's article on Saturday puts the blame fairly with 60 Minutes, her own newspaper began the charade with David Riccio's article. As Wilson accuses Nine of taking a controversial aspect of their program and using it for promotional purposes (which doesn't appear to be the case according to the trailers 60 Minutes aired), Riccio in an apparent bid to promote the forthcoming book he co-authored has zeroed in on that wavelength.

""60 Minutes got it very, very badly wrong. In trying to play the blame game, the program's producers chose to ignore facts that could have been cleared up with a phone call,"" Wilson wrote.

It would be plain to most readers that The Daily Telegraph and the News Corp stable of newspapers, The Sydney Morning Herald and all the other media that ""chased the headline"" could have done likewise. In fact The Daily Telegraph when it published the Riccio story last Sunday before the 60 Minutes airing received notice from the Melbourne Storm of the efforts Smith and the Storm players had made to visit Alex McKinnon in hospital and afterwards, and how they have supported the Rise for Alex campaign and raised other funds for his rehabilitation. Rarely did any of this make its way into News Corp stories, or for that matter any other media's treatment of the story which by this time had gone viral.

'Unbroken' has received unprecedented publicity over the chain of events that has unfolded. One can only hope this was inadvertent, and not planned. As Rebecca Wilson commented, the controversy could all have been avoided by a phone call. 60 Minutes could have avoided the furore which now surrounds the program, while David Riccio too could have phoned Cam Smith before he first made the revelations public.
""There are no winners here and the sleepless guys should not be McKinnon or Smith,"" Wilson writes in her article on Saturday which almost everyone would agree with.

Casting the blame though she says: ""They should be the faceless men producers who did not think before they pulled out the wrecking ball."" Perhaps 'the faceless men producers' could be replaced with 'the Australian media at large.'",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/929400633787026/?type=3,2015-07-12 10:13:15,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_921549004572189,"A scare in a NSW Cup rugby league game on the weekend has put the focus on a Sydney Shield player who remains a quadriplegic after a tackle-gone-wrong in a game 3 weeks ago.

On Saturday Canberra Raiders player Mitch Cronin, 23, (pictured), was taking part in a NSW Cup game against Auckland at Mt Smart Stadium.

Soon after the start, Cronin went down with what appeared to be a serious neck injury. He was taken from the field on a stretcher with his neck in a brace.

With memories fresh of a similar incident on June 7 when Cabramatta Two Blues rookie Kurt Drysdale, 20, who played in the NSW Cup last year for the Cronulla Sharks, was taken from the field in a match against the Wentworthville Magpies at Ringrose Park,  club and league officials were at a heightened state of concern.

Drysdale, according to a Royal North Hospital spokeswoman remains in intensive care in a ""serious, but stable condition."" This was confirmed on Monday June 29. His condition is ""unchanged"" since the injury and two operations which occurred on the same day more than 3 weeks ago. He has had no movement in any part of his body since.

For Mitch Cronin however the scare was short-lived and he is likely to be back playing soon. ""For a couple of minutes after it happened I had a sharp numbness down my arm and the trainer told me to stay down and stay still,"" he said.

""It's the first time it's happened to me. It was pretty scary to start with but it's all good now, just a bit of pain and I have to get it checked again this week.""

""Fortunately by the time I went off, the numbness went away.

""I didn't know what to think at the time, but I'm relieved I can get back on the field as soon as I can.""

Spinal injuries while quite rare in rugby league, and in sport generally, can be life-changing. Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon is an example of the horrific nature of the injury to him, which occurred when the Knights took on Melbourne Storm at AAMI Park in a game in May last year. He was 22 at the time. McKinnon fractured his C4 and C5 vertebrae, changing his life for the foreseeable future. While initially a quadriplegic, McKinnon has had extensive rehabilitation at an elite rehabilitation centre on the Gold Coast and at home at Newcastle. He has made considerable progress and is now back at the Knights as a recruitment officer, having taken up the appointment in January this year.  ""It's going to be a great opportunity for Alex to get his teeth into something he really loves, footy,"" Knights Coach Rick Stone said at the time. ""He's inspiring young men and everyone in the club will be really happy to see him back.""

Alex, who is now a paraplegic and is confined to a wheelchair, has been helped along the way due to his high profile in the NRL, and the NRL's support together with the rugby league community, and the Newcastle Knights in particular.

The Rise for Alex round last year alone raised in excess of $1 million for his rehabilitation. McKinnon earlier this year requested the NRL and the Knights direct their efforts with a similar fund-raising round this year towards other rugby league players who have suffered life-changing injuries.

Kurt Drysdale who will need extensive funds to secure his rehabilitation lacks the same profile as an NRL player and is struggling to raise funds. His GoToFund at the time of writing has raised just over $49,000.

His former team is also doing it tough. After being in the top 5 before the injury, the Cabramatta Two Blues have lost their last 4 games. ""It's no secret the horrific injury suffered by the team's star player Kurt Drysdale on June 7 is having its toll on the team, together with the fact that 16 other players are unavailable for selection because of injury,"" the side's coach Levih Warby was quoted as saying after last week's game.

The corresponding Cabramatta Two Blues Ron Massey Cup side has also lost its last 4. In their game last week player Henry Mahe received what appeared to be a similar injury to Drysdale and was taken to hospital by ambulance leaving his team mates in shock. By half time the side was down 24-0. ""We just weren't in it in the first half, our heads were elsewhere and we appeared rattled. After what happened to Kurt a couple of weeks ago, and for that to happen to Henry today, I think it really shook the boys up. It was a case of Deja vu and we didn't handle it too well,"" said Coach Jason Williams.

Fortunately, like Cronin, Mahe was given the all-clear and will be back playing in a few weeks. For Drysdale, there is no such prospect.

A fund-raising site 'Unite for Kurt' has been set up on gofundme.com, a link to which appears below. Donors can also transfer to a bank account set up to receive donations. Details are: Account name: Unite for Kurt, BSB: 062-130, Account number: 1117 4320.

109808052412959_920232501370506,"Giving gay rights activists their biggest victory yet, the US Supreme Court ruled Friday that same-sex couples can marry nationwide and states cannot ban such marriages - an issue that divides America.

President Barack Obama, who came out in support of same sex marriage only three years ago in the face of fast-changing public opinion in the midst of his 2012 re-election campaign, hailed the apex court's 5-4 ruling as ""a victory for America"".

Social progress sometimes comes in small increments, he said from the White House Rose Garden, ""and then there are days like this, when that  slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt"".

""America should be very proud,"" said Obama whose administration supported the challengers to the gay marriage bans in the apex court.

Unlike India, where homosexuality is a criminal offence, same-sex couples can marry in 36 American states today, but federal appeals courts have been divided over whether states must allow same-sex couples to marry and recognize such marriages performed elsewhere.

The 14 same-sex couples and two widowers who challenged gay marriage bans in Michigan, Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio were just a few of the estimated 650,000 same-sex couples in the US, 125,000 of whom are raising children.

Lawyers for the four states argued their bans were justified by  tradition and the distinctive characteristics of opposite-sex unions.

The issue, they said, should be resolved democratically, at the polls and in state legislatures, rather than by judges.

The challengers included same-sex couples who wanted to marry, those who sought to have their lawful out-of-state marriage recognized, as well as those who wanted to amend a birth or death certificate with their marriage status.

""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,"" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy for the majority with four liberal justices.

""In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were,"" he added

In a dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the court's ""threat to American democracy.""

""The substance of today's decree is not of immense personal importance to me,"" he wrote. ""But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today's judicial Putsch.""

109808052412959_919336681460088,"Julian Assange, founder and editor of WikiLeaks, has now been a refugee in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for three years. The key issue in his extraordinary incarceration is justice. He has been charged with no crime.

The first Swedish prosecutor dismissed the misconduct allegations regarding two women in Stockholm in 2010. The second Swedish prosecutor's actions were and are demonstrably political. Until recently, she refused to come to London to interview Assange. Finally, when the British government almost pleaded with her to come, she agreed. She has now cancelled her trip. 

It is a farce, but one with grim consequences for Assange should he dare step outside the Ecuadorean embassy. The US criminal investigation against him and WikiLeaks - for the ""crime"" of exercising a right enshrined in the US constitution, to tell unpalatable truths - is ""unprecedented in scale and nature"", according to US documents. For this, he faces much of a lifetime in the hellhole of a US supermax should he leave the protection of Ecuador in London. 

The Swedish allegations are no more than a sideshow to this - the SMS messages between the women involved, read by lawyers, alone would exonerate him. They refer to the accusations as ""made up"" by the police. In the police report one of the women says she was ""railroaded"" by the Swedish police. What a disgrace this is for Sweden's justice system.

Julian Assange is a refugee under international law and he should be given right of passage by the British government out of the UK, to Ecuador. The nonsense about him ""jumping bail"" is just that - nonsense. If his extradition case went through the British courts today, the European Arrest Warrant would be thrown out and he would be a free man. So what is the British government trying to prove by its absurd police cordon around an embassy whose refuge Assange has no intention of giving up? Why don't they let him go? Why is a man charged with no crime having to spend three years in one room, without light, in the heart of London? 

The Assange case amplifies many truths, and one is the accelerating, global totalitarianism of Washington, regardless of who is elected president. I am often asked if I think Assange has been ""forgotten"". It is my experience that countless ordinary people all over the world, especially in Australia, his homeland, understand perfectly well the injustice being meted out to Julian Assange. They credit him and WikiLeaks with having performed an epic public service by informing millions about what the powerful plan for them behind their backs, the lies governments and their vested interests tell, the violence they initiate. Power that is corrupt loathes this, because it is true democracy in action.

The petition, led by the National Resources Defense Council, said studies by the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program and other scientific agencies found the eight food additives can cause cancer in animals.

109808052412959_897132113680545,"U.S. standing in the world has diminished under President Barack Obama, 2016-presidential hopeful Jeb Bush said in that ill-fated interview he had with Fox News the other day.

""Except in Cuba and Iran,"" he added. Bush, critical of Obama's diplomacy initiatives with Tehran and Havana, believes the proposed peace agreement, not with the United States, but with the P51 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States plus Germany), said he would attempt to unwind the agreement with Iran if it is concluded. ""I would try for sure to undo the agreement,"" Bush said, describing Obama as ""this incredibly weak president.""

Bush has also been highly critical of Obama's efforts to end the more than 50 year embargo of Cuba. 

""The Obama Administration's decision to restore diplomatic ties with Cuba is the latest foreign policy misstep by this President, and another dramatic overreach of his executive authority,"" the former Florida governor said in a  statement when Obama announced the move in December. ""It undermines America's credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.""

""The beneficiaries of President Obama's ill-advised move will be the heinous Castro brothers who have oppressed the Cuban people for decades,"" he said.

""Cuba is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record, and now President Obama has rewarded those dictators. We should instead be fostering efforts that will truly lead to the fair, legitimate democracy that will ultimately prevail in Cuba.""

Bush's comments contrast with those of others around the world who have been trying to engineer a change in U.S. policy towards Cuba. Obama, who signaled in 2008 it was time for a change, had been conducting back-channel negotiations for 18 months before concluding an agreement. Pope Francis has been a major player in negotiations.

French President Francois Hollande, currently in Cuba, has publicly called for an end to the embargo, which he says has badly damaged Cuba's development.

For Obama it is finishing off what President John F. Kennedy set out to do more than a half-century ago. Kennedy too approved secret back-channel negotiations with Fidel Castro in September 1963. Earlier in April that year ABC correspondent Lisa Howard had scored an interview with Castro, his first TV interview in 4 years. Howard told the CIA when she returned to the U.S. that in her 8 hours of private talks with the Cuban leader, Castro indicated he wanted to negotiate with the United States with a view to ending the embargo, and was prepared to discuss the Soviet military presence in Cuba. Deputy CIA Director Richard Helms, according to Thurston Clarke's recently released book ""JFK's Last Hundred Days,"" said, ""It appears that Fidel Castro is looking for a way to reach a rapproachment with the United States government, probably because he is aware that Cuba is in a state of economic chaos.""

Kennedy encouraged the development of the talks and was seen by those close to him as very enthusiastic about coming to an accommodation with Castro which would have seen an end to the embargo while still in its infancy. 

In October 1963 Kennedy met with the editor of the Socialist newsweekly L'Observateur, Jean Daniel, knowing he was visiting Cuba in early November 1963 and was hoping to interview Castro. ""I believe there is no country in the world, including all the African regions, including any and all the countries under colonial domination, where economic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my own country's policies during the Batista regime,"" Kennedy told an amazed Daniel.

""I believe that we created, built and manufactured the Castro movement out of whole cloth and without realizing it I believe that the accumulation of these mistakes has jeopardized all of Latin America.""

""I can assure you that I have understood the Cubans. I approved the proclamation which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra when he justifiably called for justice and specially yearned to rid Cuba of corruption,"" Kennedy said. ""I will go even further to some extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the United States. Now we shall have to pay for those sins. In the matter of the Batista regime, I am in agreement with the first Cuban revolutionaries. That is perfectly clear,"" Kennedy told the reporter.

The president outlined the role of Castro in promoting communism to other Latin American countries and laid the blame on him for the Cuban missile crisis which had brought the world to the brink of nuclear war just a year earlier. However he dangled a carrot, knowing Daniel would repeat his comments to Castro. ""The United States now has the possibility of doing as much good in Latin America as it has done in the past. I would even say that we alone (not the Soviets) have this power, on the essential condition that communism does not take over there,"" Kennedy said.

Daniel asked the president about the American economic blockade. Kennedy replied it would continue as long as Castro was attempting to subvert other Latin American countries. Kennedy was holding out the prospect of U.S. recognition and aid, a lifting of the embargo, and a normalization of relations in exchange for a pledge by Castro to stop trying to export communism to other countries in Latin America.

Kennedy told Daniel he wanted a report from him on his return to the U.S., saying he would be interested in Castro's ""reactions.""

Castro by late October 1963 was expressing interest in Kennedy's overtures but was facing some opposition from his inner circle, including reportedly from his brother Raul. Nonetheless he wanted to proceed with a secret meeting, and agreed to host it in Havana, promising security and confidentiality. Kennedy was reported to be more enthusiastic about the idea than the State Department, and according to Thurston Clarke's research, the CIA Deputy Director Richard Helms who wanted to slow the process down, ""to look at it from all possible angles.""

Daniel was later to recount that in his talks with Castro, the Cuban dictator had told him, ""He (Kennedy) still has the possibility of becoming in the eyes of history, the greatest president of the United States, the leader who may at last understand that there can be coexistence between capitalists and socialists.""

Castro added, ""I know for example, that for Kruschev, Kennedy is a man you can talk with, I have gotten this impression from all my conversations with Kruschev. Other leaders have assured me that to obtain this goal (coexistence) we must first await his reelection.""

After being told of Kennedy's criticism of the Batista regime, Castro told Daniel, ""I believe Kennedy is sincere. I also believe that today the expression of this sincerity could have political significance."" Castro castigated the United States for the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the U.S. blockade, but went on to say,"" but I feel he (Kennedy) inherited a difficult situation. I also think he is a realist: he is now registering that it is impossoile to simply wave a wand and cause us, and the explosive situation throughout Latin America, to disappear."" 

Saying all this time the U.S. was selling wheat to the Russians and Canada was trading with Canada, he asked, ""why should it be impossible to make the Americans understand that socialism leads not to hostility toward them, but to coexistence? Why am I not Tito or Sekou Toure?"" 

Two days later Kennedy went to Dallas.

Ten days later Cuba's UN delegate Carlos Lechuga told Kennedy's unofficial messenger he had received a letter from Castro himself authorizing him to discuss a specific agenda for secret talks. President Johnson on December 19 1963 at a National Security Council meeting after, a brief discussion, elected not to proceed with the talks. 

Bobby Kennedy wrote to Secretary of State Dean Rusk in early December 1963 urging him to rescind the regulations prohibiting U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba. According to Clarke in ""JFK's Last Hundred Days,"" Bobby Kennedy argued that the travel bans, which had been imposed by President Eisenhower, in the final days of his presidency was ""inconsistent with our views as a free society and would contrast with such things as the Berlin Wall and communist controls on such travel."" His proposal was rejected.

The UN General Assembly since 1992 has passed a resolution every year condemning the ongoing impact of the embargo and declaring it to be in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also condemned the embargo.

Now 52 years on, Cuba is finally being brought back in from the cold.

Fidel Castro remained president of Cuba until 2008 when he handed over the stewardship of the country to his brother Raul. He was in power during the time of ten U.S. presidents ranging from Eisenhower to George W. Bush. This year he turns 89.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/897132113680545/?type=3,2015-05-13 07:00:37,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_875479042512519,"Moments after being declared the victor in the New South Wales State election, Premier Mike Baird was angry.

Following Opposition Leader Luke Foley's gracious concession speech, Baird immediately bore into his opposition describing their tactics as ""the biggest scare campaign in history."" He was talking about the Labor Party's opposition to the privatisation of the state's electricity assets. ""The people of New South Wales have chosen hope over fear,"" Baird proclaimed angrily.

The smile of the premier which had dominated throughout the campaign was gone, it appeared on about 3 occasions in the speech. An arrogant premier said he now had a ""mandate.""

Despite Baird's declaration, and just about every news commentator's endorsement that Baird has been backed by the New South Wales public to sell off the state's electricity assets, there is no mandate.

The NSW election was not a referendum on the electricity privatisation. Most people that voted on Saturday are opposed to it. The fact is the majority supported the return of the Coalition despite their plans to privatise.

Arguing that voters had warmed to the idea or came on board as a result of Baird's campaigning too is simply not true.

A Galaxy poll conducted a week before the election showed 53% opposed to Baird's plan with a further 14% undecided. Only 33% of those polled said they favoured privatisation. This was a deterioration when voters were polled two months earlier when 39% were in favour (nearly 20% more). 51% were opposed and 10% were undecided.

To say that Baird had won the debate on privatisation, and that he has a mandate to lease off publicly-owned assets simply has no basis. In fact there was a 9% statewide swing against Baird's party on the two-party preferred vote.

Foley's party is under pressure to recognise that New South Wales has voted overwhelmingly to support the privatisation. The Galaxy polls suggest otherwise, even confirmed Coalition voters remain opposed.

The final vote however will come from Fred Nile whose party holds the balance of power in the Legislative Council. Anyone thinking Nile will weigh up the options, and take into consideration the will of the people will be sadly disappointed. Although Nile has promised a select committee inquiry to ventilate ""issues"" surrounding the leasing of the poles and wires, he has already publicly stated that the outcome of that inquiry will not affect his decision. He is going to support the privatisation. ""Nile told Chanticleer he will proceed with a select committee inquiry into the poles and wires to ventilate the issues surrounding the sale but the final report will not stand in the way of the sale going ahead,"" the Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday.

The inquiry, which Nile promises will be comprehensive will be a whitewash, with its architect already committed to the privatisation camp. To assist him putting the case, Nile plans to include among ""witnesses"" former ALP heavyweights Martin Ferguson and Michael Costa, whose credentials are best illustrated by the declaration on Sunday by News Corp's Andrew Bolt, that they are his ""two top Labor Party heroes."" Both have been outspoken in their support for privatisation.

Nile also plans to call the CEO of UBS Australia whose bank wrote an ""independent"" report for the Baird government, and then provided a proof to Baird's office before deleting, at their request, a reference to privatisation being ""bad for the budget"". Baird later argued the report did not take into consideration the ""wider benefits"" of the privatisation in defence of the manipulation.

Nile who campaigned against gambling but then gave the green light to Barry O'Farrell's awarding of a casino license without tender at Barrangaroo, but then later tried to get the legislation changed to call the casino something else so as to make it look as though he hadn't approved the establishment of a casino, has already made up his mind on privatisation, and has discounted any evidence to be given by UBS. So why the inquiry? 

There have been enough politics over privatisation which has been argued for by successive Liberal and Labor governments for two decades, all the time against the wishes of the people who prefer electricity, and state assets generally, to stay in the ownership of the state for the benefit of future generations - and for protection against higher electricity prices.

Federal and state governments in the past 30 years have engaged in an orgy of sales of public assets which has benefited the government of the day, and current generations. Each time the public is told private enterprise can mange these assets more efficiently, more economically, and thus more successfully. But the yield on the sales is soon spent and the government of the day then looks around for other assets to sell. Soon everything will be gone, and future generations, they will be inheriting our debt, accumulated despite the sale of the public assets.

Baird and others will be gone by then. And so will all government assets, leaving behind the liabilities of our generation for the next, and those after them.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/875479042512519/?type=3,2015-03-30 16:37:36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_873531119373978,"In a shocking revelation, the French prosecutor said on Thursday that the co-pilot of the Germanwings A320 flight deliberately crashed the airliner, killing all 144 passengers and six crew members on board.

The action of the first officer, Andreas G. Lubitz, of the crashed Germanwings A320 in the French Alps ""can be analysed as his intention to destroy the aircraft"", said Brice Robin at a press conference on Thursday in Marseille.

The prosecutor told media that they had come to this conclusion after listening to the cockpit voice recorder recovered from the crash site, the Spanish news agency EFE said.

Robin said the 28-year-old co-pilot appears to have deliberately refused to open the door for the captain who had left the cockpit briefly after flight 4U 9525 took off from Barcelona in Spain headed for Dusseldorf in Germany.

He said that for the first 20 minutes of the flight, there was ""normal conversation"" between the two pilots till the captain decided to leave the cockpit.

The moving of the seat and shutting of the door could be heard on the cockpit voice recorder. Later, they could make out a banging on the door, with the captain asking the co-pilot to open the door. This could be heard on the speaker phone that the captain used.

The co-pilot was alive till the last moment, as his breathing could be heard, but he apparently chose not to speak up or respond to the captain, the prosecutor said, adding that no words were spoken in the last 10 minutes before the plane crashed around 11 a.m. local time on Tuesday in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence in the southern French Alps.

He said the plane started its descent even as the captain was asking to be allowed in.

""This could only be from a deliberate act"" on the part of the co-pilot, the prosecutor said.

According to Robin, there was no indication that the co-pilot was a terrorist.

According to a Xinhua report from Berlin, Germanwings and its parent company said in a joint statement that they have been ""shaken"" by the French prosector's report.

""We are shaken by the upsetting statements of the French authorities,"" said Germanwings and Lufthansa in a statement on Twitter.

""Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families and friends of the victims,"" said the statement.

In Cologne, Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said that his company and Germanwing were ""stunned"" by the French prosecutor's statements.

Addressing the media, Spohr said what had happened in the plane was ""not conceivable"".

He stressed at the same time that all Lufthansa pilots, including the two pilots on board the crashed plane, had been ""carefully selected"", adding that they are trained and passed tests to become pilots.

Transponder data indicates the autopilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data has revealed.

German authorities say ""that we have to assume"" Flight 9525 ""was deliberately activated for a crash,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday. ""This is hard to comprehend for most people. Nobody can imagine this.""

The French government has asked the FBI to help investigate the crash, a law enforcement official said Thursday.

According to Spohr, the co-pilot had passed all the flight and medical tests and was 100 percent fit to fly.

He said Lubitz started his training in an aviation school in Bremen, Germany, in 2008, but the process got interrupted. Spohr did not mention the reason for this.

The training then resumed, the chief executive said, and Lubitz started to work as a co-pilot for Germanwings since 2013.

According to Spohr, a pilot candidate for Lufthansa and Germanwings must receive a fitness test after training interruption for whatever reasons and can only continue if the fitness was established.

The Airbus A320, Flight 4U 9525 operated by Lufthansa-owned company Germanwings, was en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dsseldorf, Germany.

German media outlets report that about 14 German high school students and two teachers on the way back from an exchange trip were among the 144 passengers. Six crew members were also aboard.

""It's tragic, I'm stunned,"" Schools Minister for the state of North-Rhine Westphalia Sylvia Lhrmann said in an interview with WDR radio.

Hans-Josef Bing, deputy mayor of the town of Haltern, said the students and teachers from Joseph Knig high school were booked on the flight and feared they may be crash victims.

""We must fear that that's the case,"" he said. Haltern has a population of about 38,000.

French President Francois Hollande said the crash was a tragedy.

""The conditions of the accident, which have not yet been clarified, lead us to think there are no survivors,"" Hollande said, adding that the crash site is difficult to access.

Hollande contacted German Chancellor Angela Merkel to express his sympathy. Merkel said she plans to visit the crash site.

""This is the hour in which we all feel deep sorrow,"" she told reporters.

Search-and-rescue teams are undergoing operations. The cause of the crash is unknown, according to French Prime Minister Manuel Valls.

Opting to bat first, South Africa posted a mammoth target of 411 runs, thanks to the twin tons by Hashim Amla (159) and Faf du Plessis (109). Following the dismissal of opener Quinton de Kock (1), Amla and du Plessis build up a 247-run partnership for the second wicket before falling prey to Andy McBrine and Kevin O'Brien's deliveries. AB de Villiers could only contribute a brisk 24-run off just nine balls before being dismissed by McBrine. Subsequently, David Miller (46) and Rilee Rossouw (61) accelerated the innings as the duo remained unbeaten to put up a solid 110-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Chasing an imposing target of 411, Ireland kept on losing wickets in quick succession and were reeling at 48-5 in the 11th over. However, Andy Balbirnie (58) found an able ally in Kevin (48) as the duo showed some resistance to put up an 81-run stand for the sixth wicket before their dismissal. Kyle Abbott was the pick of the bowlers as he claimed wickets of Williams Porterfield (12), Naill O'Brien (14), Kevin and Gary Wilson (0). Moreover, Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn scalped five wickets in total to bundle up Ireland for mere 210 runs.

109808052412959_860949297298827,"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, the largest and most influential proprietor of media assets in Australia, has given a clear and unequivocal signal that Mr. Murdoch doesn't want any change in the leadership of the Australian government.

While a general media frenzy surrounds the embattled Prime Minister Tony Abbott, News Corp newspapers on Saturday gave a strong endorsement to Abbott, saying he should be given another ten months, ""to turn things around.""

The Murdoch press also says Treasurer Joe Hockey should be sacked.

The media group is also muddying the waters in relation to contenders. While Malcolm Turnbull has emerged as the clear-cut replacement for Abbott should he go, the News Corp papers are now saying Julie Bishop will run if the leadership is declared vacant and are hinting that Scott Morrison might be a contender as well. In a number of stories, Bishop is even being quoted ahead of Turnbull in terms of those that might contest the leadership, an indication that if the leadership is to change, the Murdoch press will rally behind Bishop, although longer term it appears to have its eyes on Morrison.

Treasurer Joe Hockey will be under no illusion that he will ever again be a challenger. News Corp has written him off completely, describing him in an editorial on Saturday as ""not up to the task"" of Treasurer, blaming him in part, together with the prime minister's chief of staff, for Abbott's decline in popularity. The newspaper says Abbott ""is blind to the damage being done to his side by a sub-optimal Treasurer.""

The Australian, the group's flagship newspaper, has attacked Abbott's critics within the government calling them ""bed wetters,"" ""miscreants,"" ""executive panic merchants,"" and in reference to backbenchers, has described them as ""junior woodchucks sitting in the outer.""

News Corp's advice is for the Liberal Party ""to hold its nerve."" The Murdoch paper points out that while there has been public disappointment in Tony Abbott's performance, ""the government's standing in the polls is by no means disastrous this far out from an election.""

""What Liberal MPs need to ask themselves is which of the leadership options - Mr Abbott, Julie Bishop, Malcolm Turnbull or even Scott Morrison is best able to maintain the position and prosecute the risks of a reversion to Labor,"" The Australian says. ""They will find the incumbent, for all his failings, appears more attractive: on the proviso he can grow into the job.""

All the issues the government is facing ""can be addressed if Mr Abbott is given time to regroup,"" the Murdoch flagship says.

In its strongest endorsement, The Australian editorial says, ""In our view Mr Abbott remains the best person to lead the Coalition to the next election but only if the prime minister quickly, manifestly improves his ways. Good sense demands that he be given until the end of the year to turn things around.""

Murdoch, in the editorial, goes on to point out the negatives of a Turnbull administration, saying he ""would serve his and the Coalition's interest by biding his time and allowing Mr Abbott clear air.""

The newspaper refers to Turnbull's previous ""incarnation as leader"", which it says ""came too early,"" and says he ""faltered,"" and described his judgements as ""often askew."" The newspaper says Turnbull ""does not provide a sharp enough contrast to voters in squaring off against Mr Shorten.""

Turnbull needn't despair however, Mr Murdoch does have a job for him, and that is as Treasurer. In a quick about-face, the same editorial that describes the former leader as having judgements that are ""askew,"" says ""Mr Turnbull, one of the best minds in parliament, a clever advocate and a successful businessman, should be the custodian (of the Treasury).""

Curiously the newspaper is also pushing for a reconciliation between Abbott and Arthur Sinodinos, who has been liasing between some ministers and the Turnbull support base. Rather than Sinodinos missing out if Turnbull doesn't succeed Abbott, Murdoch says Abbott should appoint Sinodinos as Cabinet Secretary.

While most in the government, and in the non-Murdoch media are cooking up a storm over the Liberal leadership, The Daily Telegraph, News Corp's largest-selling daily newspaper in Australia, sees it this way in Saturday's editorial: 

""As February draws to an end, a handful of political novices have attempted to reopen the (leadership) issue but were met by a wall of comment from experienced senior colleagues who want to get on with the business of government. That's what the Australian people want too.""

""In the 3 weeks since the disruptive coup attempt, Mr Abbott's polling has enjoyed an impressive 8-point turnaround,"" the editorial enthuses. ""His parliamentary performance has improved and most Australians would agree with his stances on the economy and national security.""

His stances on the economy?

Rupert Murdoch is largely credited with the creation of the Abbott government, with moves dating back to 2009 when he began pushing for the ouster of Kevin Rudd as prime minister, despite backing him in the 2007 election. Following the ""utegate"" debacle which News Corp had a major hand in whipping up, not only Rudd, but then-Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull were both deposed. A strong campaign to promote the credentials of Tony Abbott, and a relentless attack on Julia Gillard, Rudd's successor, resulted in a hung parliament in the 2010 election which cost Australia dearly. In 2013, Murdoch threw everything he could at getting Abbott elected, famously running a front page editorial days before the election, with the banner headline: ""Australia needs Tony.""

The election was opened with a front page editorial in the The Daily Telegraph which had the banner headline (in reference to the then-government) ""Throw This Mob Out.""

The Murdoch media has been interfering in politics in Australia for at least four decades.

In 1975, when News Corp was pushing to oust Gough Whitlam's Labor government, all the journalists at The Australian went out on strike, protesting their proprietor's interference in the editorial activities of the newspaper.

In Q and A just weeks ago, former Treasurer Wayne Swan described the Australian Government as a wholly-owned subsidiary of News Corp. The tenor and tone of Saturday's editorials would leave readers with a similar view. It seems the role of appointing the prime minister of Australia, and for that matter the Treasurer and even the Cabinet Secretary, deciding who should be appointed, when they should go, and who should replace them is not for the party room, nor for the electorate, but for those in charge in New York.

If the paper's balance is to be scrutinised further one only has to go to its ""Letters to the Editor,"" in Saturday's edition.

The section is headlined ""Liberal MPs seem to have lost the concept of loyalty.""

The first letter opens with: ""A pathetic lot of back-biting disloyal, leaking Liberals has forced me to move from being a voter in the shadows to having a say. Our Prime Minister has more courage, fight and loyalty for our country than all of you put together. Give him your loyalty."" The letter closes with: ""Abbott is a fighter, and he's listened to concerns. Liberals should stand beside him and fight.""

The second letter takes issue with a a letter of the previous day saying, ""I can't agree with your correspondent's views that Malcolm Turnbull would be acceptable to Liberal voters."" This letter is the only one published that has a contrary view to that being advocated by the newspaper's edition on Saturday.

Following is the first sentence of all other letters selected by the editor in the order they are displayed:

""Tony Abbott is not a great PM. Nor is he the worst."" 

""The role of prime ministers in Australia has become a poisoned chalice.""

""I suggest we should have a spill against Liberal backbenchers.""

""Apart from the lunacy of repeating what Labor did in June 2010, why would the Liberals install as their leader a man who would be equally , if not more, at home leading the Labor party, who has the overwhelming support of the Q and A audience and whose Newspoll results as leader of the opposition were dismal?""

""Coalition members should consider carefully before they replace Tony Abbott with the leftist Malcolm Turnbull because it will leave conservative people disenfranchised.""

""Malcolm Turnbull and his supporters claim that Tony Abbott has poor communication skills and is unable to change his autocratic leadership style, but when Turnbull led the Liberal Party, he made some poor decisions and was even more autocratic than Abbott.""

Having digested the Letters to the Editor, News Corp readers for further assurance as to the newspaper's proprietors views could then go on to review readers' comments in the newspaper's Last Post section. In the order in which the Editor of the newspaper has displayed the comments, they are as follows:

""Should the Liberal Party go the way of Labor and knife a sitting Prime Minister, I know for sure how I shall vote at the 2016 election.""

""Tony Abbott seems more bunkered down that former US president Richard Nixon at the height of Watergate. He doesn't exactly exude Nixon's paranoia but there seems to be a lot of aggression about him.""

""If my astute political tea-leaf reading is correct, I recommend that the cabal of agitators and delinquents in the Liberal Party take their puberty pills and don't do it. We voted for Tony not Malcolm.""

""Another worrying indication of Malcolm Turnbull's leanings, apart from his need to please the limousine socialists of his electorate, is his former partnership in the Whitlam Turnbull investment bank.""

""Scott Morrison was most impressive in his presentation to the National Press Club. He didn't beat around the bush about our financial position - he told it as it is. Morrison is a man of clear convictions and the ability to convey his message to the public. There's no pussy-footing around with political niceties. Morrison is the sort of person we need to lead the nation.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/860949297298827/?type=3,2015-02-28 13:24:29,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_856238844436539,"Australia's best known Guantanamo Bay inmate David Hicks has had his conviction quashed by a U.S. military court in Cuba. The United States Court of Military Commission Review ruled on Wednesday ""the appellant's conviction cannot stand on its merits."" The judgement said, ""The findings of guilty are set aside and dismissed, and the appellant's sentence is vacated."" 

Hicks, now 39, spent five years in Guantanamo Bay from January 2002 until May 2007, when in controversial circumstances he was encouraged to take a plea bargain in order to enable him to return home to Australia.

The Hicks case provoked protests in Australia where a large proportion of the population believed he was an innocent party who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Then Prime Minister John Howard who was facing a national election in 2007 was widely believed to have lobbied the U.S. government, in particular Vice President Dick Cheney, to do something about Hicks. Cheney visited Australia in February 2007, and in March the plea bargain was negotiated, and by April Hicks was on his way back to a prison in Australia. 

The guilty plea Hicks agreed to and the 7-year sentence sentence that went with it was overturned by the military review Wednesday. It is unknown whether the U.S. government will appeal the military court's decision.

""We are very happy for David,"" Wells Dixon of the Centre for Constitutional Rights said Wednesday. Today's decision is a powerful reminder that he committed no crime, he is innocent of any offence.""

""David Hicks can now be truly free of Guantanamo,"" Dixon added.

Hicks was charged with providing material support for terrorism.
 
Asked what the decision means, Stephen Kenny, Hick's lawyer in Australia, said, 
""Well it means David Hicks' conviction has been set aside and he's been declared an innocent man so it confirms what we knew all along."" 

""He's an innocent man and quite frankly he should never have been in Guantanamo, and should certainly never have been there as long as he was.""

""David Hicks was innocent and that has formally been recorded by the military commission itself,"" Kenny said.

David Hicks's father, Terry Hicks, who fought the U.S. justice system for nearly a decade said ""It's been a long road which has finally now come to an end. It's pretty hard to take in at the moment.""

""It's been a long time, we've known the story for many, many years. And now, at last the Americans have done the right thing,"" he said.

""That's the end of it.""

Hicks was in captivity from December 2001 until December 2007. He was taken prisoner by the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan in December 2001 after the United States invaded Afghanistan in the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. The Northern Alliance received a bounty of $5,000 from the U.S. military in return for handing him over. He was then transported to Guantanamo Bay as an enemy combatant. The U.S. brought charges against Hicks in 2004 under a military commission established by Presidential Order. Those proceedings failed in 2006 when the Supreme Court ruled that the military commission was unconstitutional. The military commission system was then re-established by an act of the U.S. Congress.

Revised charges were brought against Hicks in February 2007 before a new commission, shortly after the Cheney visit to Australia. The following month, the plea bargain was approved by the commission and Hicks returned to Australia in April that year where he served the remaining 9 months of his 7 year sentence. Colonel Morris Davis, the former chief prosecutor of the military commission, later alleged political interference by the Bush administration and the Howard government.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/856238844436539/?type=3,2015-02-18 16:53:08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_854714177922339,"A court in Dubai on Sunday handed down light sentences to four men after prosecutors claimed a 13-year old boy had been gang-raped by the men at knifepoint. Prosecutors argued the boy had been kidnapped and taken against his will on two occasions, at one time being raped by two men, and on a second occasion by the same two men and 2 others. Police also charged the offenders had threatened to kill the boy and his family.

The Dubai Court of First Instance, presided over by  Judge Mohammad Jamal however dismissed the charges, preferring the evidence of the four men, all UAE nationals, over that of the police and the prosecution..

Judge Jamal ruled the sex by the four men, on the two occasions, had been consensual.

The boy complained he had been approached by one of the men while spending time at the beach. He was told by one of the men  who approached him that he was a friend of his cousin. He asked for his telephone number. That night the man phoned the boy and asked him to meet him. When he did so he was taken by car to an unmanned telephone booster station in Umm Suqeim, where the four men, according to the boy raped him.

The father told prosecutors that he found out about the rapes when he noticed his son could not pray or kneel properly at the mosque. ""When I asked him why, he claimed to me that he had been raped shortly after my wife took him and his brothers to play football at the Jumeirah Open Beach,"" the father said.

The boy told police, ""I gave the man my number. He phoned me at 10pm and asked to meet me at a nearby school. I complied because he threatened to come to our place. The first time it was A.A. and A.E. (names withheld) who drove me to the station and had sex with me at knifepoint. I was afraid to report them to the police because they threatened to kill me and my family. Two weeks later, the four suspects raped me the same way and in the same place,"" alleged the boy.

Court records showed the four men denied the boy's claims and said the sex was consensual.

The Dubai court on Sunday accepted the men's testimony and ruled the boy had engaged in consensual sex, dismissing the charges of kidnapping, holding the boy at knifepoint, rape, and making threats against the boy and his family. 

The father had told prosecutors he wanted the death penalty for the four men aged 21, 20, 19 and 18. Instead two were sentenced to 2 years in prison, and the other two to 3 years in prison, for having consensual sex.

109808052412959_854682671258823,"Australian scientists have taken aim at critics of climate change, laying out a solid case for taking action to address it, and warning of dire consequences if it is not addressed.

The Australian Academy of Science on Friday released its latest update in the form of a booklet addressing nine of the key issues. The booklet is titled 'Science Of Climate Change: Questions And Answers warns of the consequences for Australia if no changes are made to address the issue.'

The publication's objective is to counter confusion created by contradictory information in the public domain. It sets out to explain the current situation in climate science, including where there is consensus in the scientific community and where uncertainties exist. 

""We need to communicate with the public efficiently, effectively and convincingly so that they're aware. This update, which has been written and rigorously reviewed by seventeen of Australia's leading experts in a range of climate-related sciences, provides a clear and balanced account of climate change and its impact on Australia,"" Academy president Professor Andrew Holmes said Friday.

""Climate change is not something happening in the far-off future, it's happening now. 2014 was the hottest year on record, and fourteen of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred during the first 15 years of this century.""

""The planet is warming because we've relied too heavily on burning fossil fuels for our energy. If we continue to burn fossil fuels in the way we have in the past there will be profound consequences,"" Professor Holmes said.

""We have a number of choices about how we act, including learning to adapt, and preventing further damage by cutting emissions.

""But if we don't take action, we'll continue to experience increases in the number, duration and severity of heatwaves and extreme fire risk days, changes in water supply and food production, and impacts on infrastructure including roads and electricity supply,"" the academy president added,

Earth's climate has changed over the past century, the scientists argue. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, sea levels have risen, and glaciers and ice sheets have decreased in size. The best available evidence indicates that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main cause, the say. Continuing increases in greenhouse gases will produce further warming and other changes in Earth's physical environment and ecosystems.

The science behind the science community's statements, it says, is supported by extensive studies based on four main lines of evidence:

Physical principles established more than a century ago tell us that certain trace gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour, restrict the radiant flow of heat from Earth to space. This mechanism, known as the 'greenhouse effect', keeps Earth's surface and lower atmosphere considerably warmer than they would otherwise be. The gases involved are called 'greenhouse gases'. An increase in greenhouse gas concentrations raises the temperature of the surface.

The record of the distant past(millions of years) tells us that climate has varied greatly through Earth's history. It has, for example, gone through ten major ice age cycles over approximately the past million years. Over the last few thousand years of this period, during which civilisations developed, climate was unusually stable. Evidence from the past confirms that climate can be sensitive to small persistent changes, such as variations in Earth's orbit.
Measurements from the recent past (the last 150 years) tell us that Earth's surface has warmed as atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases increased through human activities, and that this warming has led to other environmental changes. Although climate varies from decade to decade, the overall upward trend of average global surface temperature over the last century is clear.
Climate models allow us to understand the causes of past climate changes, and to project climate change into the future. Together with physical principles and knowledge of past variations, models provide compelling evidence that recent changes are due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. They tell us that, unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced greatly and greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised, greenhouse warming will continue to increase.

The document released on Friday, the academy says, aims to summarise and clarify the current scientific understanding of climate change by answering nine key questions.

1 What is climate change?

The term 'climate', in its broadest sense, refers to a statistical description of weather and of the related conditions of oceans, land surfaces and ice sheets. This includes consideration of averages, variability and extremes. Climate change is an alteration in the pattern of climate over a long period of time, and may be due to a combination of natural and humaninduced causes.

2 How has climate changed?

Global climate has varied greatly throughout Earth's history. In the final decades of the 20th century, the world experienced a rate of warming that is unprecedented for thousands of years, as far as we can tell from the available evidence. Global average temperature rise has been accompanied by ongoing rises in ocean temperatures, ocean heat storage, sea levels and atmospheric water vapour. There has also been shrinkage in the size of ice sheets and most glaciers. The recent slowdown in the rate of surface warming is mainly due to climate variability that has redistributed heat in the ocean, causing warming at depth and cooling of surface waters. Australia's climate has warmed along with the global average warming.

3 Are human activities causing climate change?

Human activities are increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This increase is extremely likely to have caused most of the recent observed global warming, with CO being the largest contributor. Some observed changes in Australia's climate, including warming throughout the continent and drying trends in the southwest, have been linked to rising greenhouse gas concentrations.

4 How do we expect climate to evolve in the future?

If greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow rapidly, it is expected that, by 2100, the global average air temperature over the Earth's surface will warm by around 4C above mid-19th century temperatures. There are many likely ramifications of this warming. However, if emissions are reduced sufficiently rapidly, there is a chance that global average warming will not exceed 2C and other impacts will be limited.

5 How are extreme events changing?

Since the mid-20th century, climate change has resulted in increases in the frequency and intensity of very hot days and decreases in very cold days. These trends will continue with further global warming. Heavy rainfall events have intensified over most land areas and will likely continue to do so, but changes are expected to vary by region.

6 How are sea levels changing?

Sea levels have risen during the 20th century. The two major contributing factors are the expansion of sea water as it warms, and the loss of ice from glaciers. Sea levels are very likely to rise more quickly during the 21st century than the 20th century, and will continue to rise for many centuries.

7 What are the impacts of climate change?

Climate change has impacts on ecosystems, coastal systems, fire regimes, food and water security, health, infrastructure and human security. Impacts on ecosystems and societies are already occurring around the world, including in Australia. The impacts will vary from one region to another and, in the short term, can be both positive and negative. In the future, the impacts of climate change will intensify and interact with other stresses. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to be high, it is likely that the human-induced component of climate change will exceed the capacity of some countries to adapt.

8 What are the uncertainties and their implications?

There is near-unanimous agreement among climate scientists that human-caused global warming is real. However, future climate change and its effects are hard to predict accurately or in detail, especially at regional and local levels. Many factors prevent more accurate predictions, and some uncertainty is likely to remain for considerable time. Uncertainty in climate science is no greater than in other areas where policy decisions are routinely taken to minimise risk. Also, the uncertainty means that the magnitude of future climate change could be either greater or less than present-day best estimates.

9 What does science say about options to address climate change?

Societies, including Australia, face choices about how to respond to the consequences of future climate change. Available strategies include reducing emissions, capturing CO2, adaptation and 'geoengineering'. These strategies, which can be combined to some extent, carry different levels of environmental risk and different societal consequences. The role of climate science is to inform decisions by providing the best possible knowledge of climate outcomes and the consequences of alternative courses of action.

109808052412959_852595898134167,"Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index was released on Thursday showing a dramatic decline in press freedom around the world. The highly respected index ranks the performance of 180 countries according to a range of criteria that include media pluralism and independence, respect for the safety and freedom of journalists, and the legislative, institutional and infrastructural environment in which the media operate.

Three Scandinavian countries: Finland, which has been in first place for five years in succession, followed by Norway and Denmark top the list, as has been the case for the past five years. At the other end of the scale, Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea, in last place, were the worst performers. France is ranked 38th (up one place), the United States 49th (down three places), Japan 61st (down two places), Brazil 99 (up 12 places), Russia 152 (down four places), Iran 173rd (unchanged) and China 176th (down one place).

The 2015 World Press Freedom Index highlights the worldwide deterioration in freedom of information in 2014. Beset by wars, the growing threat from non-state operatives, violence during demonstrations and the economic crisis, media freedom is in retreat on all five continents.

The indicators compiled by Reporters Without Borders are incontestable. There was a drastic decline in freedom of information in 2014. Two-thirds of the 180 countries surveyed for the 2015 World Press Freedom Index performed less well than in the previous year. The annual global indicator, which measures the overall level of violations of freedom of information in 180 countries year by year, has risen to 3,719, an 8 percent increase over 2014 and almost 10 percent compared with 2013. The decline affected all continents.

The European Union-Balkans region is in the lead by far, but nonetheless recorded the biggest fall between the 2014 and 2015 editions. This disturbing trend reflects a two-fold phenomenon: the excesses of some member countries on the one hand and the inability of EU mechanisms to contain them on the other. The region that is bottom of the freedom of information list, North Africa and the Middle East, this year once again contained information ""black holes."" Comprising entire regions, these are controlled by non-state groups in which independent information simply does not exist.

Andorra (32nd), the sharpest fall, has paid the price for the lack of independence of its media from financial, political and religious interests. It fell by 27 places as a result of the many conflicts of interests and the great difficulty experienced by journalists in covering the activities of Andorran banks, coupled with the lack of any legal protection for freedom of information, such as the confidentiality of journalists' sources.

In Asia, East Timor (103rd) fell by 26 places. The creation of a press council and the adoption of a code of ethics in October 2013 have been a disappointment. In 2014, the government proposed a tough new media law, which has led to widespread self-censorship.

In sub-Saharan Africa, Congo (107th) fell 25 places after a difficult year for independent news outlets. The government stepped up its witch-hunt of critical journalists, at times resorting to extreme violence. Journalists who refuse to keep quiet are forced to flee the country or are expelled.

Western Europe saw numerous countries in decline. Italy (73rd) fell 24 places after a difficult year for journalists for whom threats from the mafia, among others, and unjustified defamation suits, skyrocketed. Iceland (21st, down 13) paid the price of worsening relations between politicians and media. The drop was an alarm call for this ""model of democracy"".

In South America, Venezuela (137th) fell 20 places. The National Bolivarian Guard (national army) opened fire on journalists during demonstrations, although they were clearly identified as such. In Ecuador (108th, down 13), the promising Organic Law on Communication soon revealed its limitations. Forced corrections became a means of institutional censorship.

Journalists working in Libya (154th, down 17 places) have lived through a chaotic period since the fall of Gaddafi, during which Reporters Without Borders recorded seven murders and 37 kidnappings of journalists. Faced with such violence, more than 40 people working in the media decided to leave the country in 2014. Reporting on the activities of the militias that have carved up the country is an act of heroism.

In South Sudan (125th, down 6 places), gripped by civil war, the radical polarisation and constant harassment of news organizations caused it to fall down the rankings. Press freedom was suspended ""because of civil war"", as a Reporters Without Borders headline said in July last year on the third anniversary of the country's birth.

Pressure on independent media continued to intensify in Russia (152nd, down 4), with another string of draconian laws, website blocking and independent news outlets either brought under control or throttled out of existence. The repressive climate encouraged some local despots to step up their persecution of critics.

In the Caucasus, Azerbaijan (162nd, down 2) suffered an unprecedented crackdown on critics and registered the biggest fall in score among the index's 25 lowest-ranking countries. With media freedom already limited by one-sided regulation and control of the advertising market, the few remaining independent publications were either collapsing under the impact of astronomic damages awards or were simply closed by the police. The number of journalists and bloggers who were jailed turned Azerbaijan into Europe's biggest prison for news providers.

In the Americas, the United States (49th, down three places) continues its decline. In 2014, the New York Times journalist James Risen came under government pressure to reveal his sources. Although the Obama administration backed away in that case, it continues its war on information in others, such as WikiLeaks.

There are few risers in the ranks. Mongolia (54th) rose 34 places, the Index's biggest jump. It had few violations in 2014, while the benefits of legislation on access to information began to be seen. Problems remain, however, including on the legislative front, but there has been a clear improvement.

Tonga (44th), which held its first democratic elections in 2010, strengthened its position thanks to an independent press, which has established its role as a counter-weight to the government. The Polynesian nation has risen an enviable 19 places.

The long-running political crisis in Madagascar (64th) came to an end with the election of Hery Rajaonarimampianina as president in January 2014 and the departure of the information minister. This democratic transition eased the previous polarisation and boosted the country by 17 places. Yet some subjects remain taboo, such as the financial monopolies in the hands of leading political figures.

In Europe, Georgia (69th, up 15) continued to rise for the third year running and is now close to where it was before the 2008 war. It is enjoying the fruits of reforms undertaken after a change of government through elections, but it continued to be handicapped by the extreme polarization of its news media.

In 86th place, Ivory Coast (up 15 places) continued to emerge from the political and social crisis that plunged the country into full-scale civil war in 2010. The results are still mixed in a country where the broadcasting sector is expected to be opened up in 2015, although there are some fears that this might usher in institutional censorship.

Nepal (105th) was up 15 places thanks to a drop in violence by the security forces against journalists, especially at demonstrations. This improvement remains to be confirmed in 2015.

Tunisia (126th) rose seven places, a relative increase although in absolute terms the country stagnated. However, the fact remains that political stabilisation in 2014 had benefits for news and information. On the other hand, the number of attacks on journalists remains too high and the implementation of measures to ensure freedom of information has been long in coming.

A cause for satisfaction was Brazil (99th, up 12 places), which rose above the symbolic 100 mark thanks to a less violent year in which two journalists were killed compared with five in the previous year.

Still in the Americas, Mexico (148th) managed to pull itself up four places. In November, which is not included in the 2015 Index, journalists were attacked during demonstrations about the disappearance of 43 trainee teachers in thesouthwestern state of Guerrero. Reporters Without Borders recorded three cases in Mexico of journalists killed as a direct result of their work, compared with two in 2013.

Conflicts proliferated in 2014: the Middle East, Ukraine, Syria and Iraq. All warring parties without exception waged a fearsome information war. The media, used for propaganda purposes or starved of information, became strategic targets and were attacked, or even silenced.

Non-state groups follow no laws and disregard basic rights in pursuit of their own ends. From Boko Haram to Islamic State, Latin American drug traffickers and the Italian mafia, motives may vary but their modus operandi is the same  the use of fear and reprisals to silence journalists and bloggers who dare to investigate them or refuse to act as their mouthpieces.

Stretching sacrilege prohibitions in order to protect a political system is an extremely effective way of censuring criticism of the government in countries where religion shapes the law. The criminalization of blasphemy endangers freedom of information in around half of the world's countries. When ""believers"" think the courts are not doing enough to ensure respect for God or the Prophet, they sometimes take it upon themselves to remind journalists and bloggers what they may or may not say.

Can journalists be seen as the common enemy of protesters and police alike at some demonstrations? This is the sad conclusion of Reporters Without Borders this year. 2014 saw an increase in violence towards reporters and netizens covering demonstrations.

The European Unions recorded a bigger decline in 2015 than in the 2014 Index, exposing the limits of its ""democratic model"" and highlighting the inability of its mechanisms to halt the erosion. The EU appears to be swamped by a certain desire on the part of some member states to compromise on freedom of information. As a result, the gaps between members are widening  EU countries are ranked from 1st to 106th in the Index, an unprecedented spread.

Democracies often take liberties with their values in the name of national security. Faced with real or spurious threats, governments arm themselves routinely with an entire arsenal of laws aimed at muzzling independent voices. This phenomenon is common to both authoritarian governments and democracies.

These authoritarian governments are in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and also the Middle East. Most are headed by cartoon characters come to life who would be a laughed at if they did not exercise total control over news and information. In 2014 they further tightened the grip they have had on the media for many years. Among the lowest-ranking 20 countries in the 2015 Index, 15 performed even worse than they did in the 2014 edition.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/852595898134167/?type=3,2015-02-12 02:50:33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_847189842008106,"Christian marriage is thought to be an eternal bond. However, the institution of marriage is buffeted with all kinds of demands in our modern world. The marriage vows declared together with a host of your friends and family on your big wedding day can either turn out to be a joy or a pain. What happens next if you chose the wrong person or circumstances led you up against a brick wall? 

The less liked road to divorce is always fraught with heartaches and regret. However, in some cultures the word 'divorce' is even frowned upon and regarded as a taboo and even more so in a Christian marriage which is originally meant to be a life-long bond. 

I am not an advocate of divorce; however it is essential to highlight the legal implications which particularly Christian women face and make the sad reality of a failed marriage even more miserable. The current Pakistani justice system puts Christian women in chains rather than offering them a reasonable solution to get out of a failed marriage.  

Last year, the Federal Government of Pakistan proposed reforms of the old British Christian Marriage Law Act of 1872 and Divorce Act of 1869, which prove an endless albatross particularly for Christian women, locked in dead-end marriages with few legal rights to protect themselves and re-gain their so-called 'societal prestige' in an already conservative and patriarchal society.

Under Section 10 of the Christian Divorce Act, 1869, man can seek divorce on the grounds of adultery while a woman cannot seek divorce over adultery by her husband. The wife must provide evidence of adultery coupled with either bigamy, incest, sodomy, rape or bestiality, cruelty or must prove desertion for a period of two or more years. In a society where the man in the house is an 'uncrowned prince' while women live in the shadows, it would be impossible for a woman to stand up against her husband. She either will be subject to abuse and triviality or even be silenced forever on her disobedience. 

On the other hand, the current law provides enough room for men to abuse divorce. Nine times out of ten men bring false accusation of adultery against their wives or 'simply' convert to Islam to disengage themselves from their Christian marriage vows. This gnawing legal gap which gives more 'power' to men over women needs to be addressed.  

The Express Tribune Pakistan reported on 31 January that a Judge at Lahore High Court, Shahzada Mazhar, termed the 1869 Christian Divorce Act as 'derogatory' to women. He was hearing a petition from a Christian man, Ameen Masih, seeking divorce and contravention to the 146 year old Divorce Act. Mr Masih is demanding separation from his wife since he feels he cannot live with her anymore but for that he would have to declare her as an 'adulterer'. He does not want to brand his wife as someone she is not and hence the complexity of getting a divorce becomes more tortuous.

In addition to the legal neglect there is  the negative cultural perception of divorce; in Pakistan, being a woman, Christian, and divorced resembles a treble-tragedy. Women, who are already marginalised with less legal protection, are left in a precarious situation which makes them a soft target for abuse, neglect, denial and all forms of violence. A divorce for a Christian woman is regarded an eternal shame and stigma and most time regarded by friends and family as an epitome of a fallen angel (sometimes without even a fault) while men walk away with a clean track record over laws which favour them the most. The right of self-determination is not given the current divorce system and it rather supports the culture of stigmatisation of women. 

Both, Marriage Law and Divorce Act, being the legacy of colonial times, have haunted numberless women affecting tens and thousands of Christian families across the country. The Pakistan legal system seems stuck with the old laws forever while the British legal system has evolved through the test of time.

In the British law, the dissolution of marriage was once a prerogative of men through an Act of Parliament, as an expensive route available for the rich and the royals. King Henry VIII was granted a divorce by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Church retained the power to dissolve marriages.

Later in 1857 the Matrimonial Clause Act allowed common man to divorce as well. Then, according to British Law women could divorce men if they could prove that a husband had been unfaithful with additional faults which included adultery, rape and incest. In 1923, a Private Member's Bill was proposed which made the divorce procedure easier but it still had to be proved. Later in 1937, few more stipulations were added that allowed divorce including drunkenness, insanity and desertion. The most recent major change was made in 1969 when in case of only one spouse wanting a divorce couples would have to be living separately for two years or five years before a divorce was made possible. Divorces normally favour maintenance provided to the less wealthy spouse – usually the woman.

The case of Ameen Masih in Lahore should set the tone for more legal rights to be provided to Christian women as well as men if they seek divorce. The current system demands the spouses to defame each other to extend that particularly women can never recover from. Further it leaves little to no chance to Christian women to liberate themselves from 'abusive marriages' and leaves them in an endless misery. The time is long overdue for an amendment of the current marriage and divorce laws. 

Worldwide the Church has taken many strides in the recent past to fit in our ever-changing world. The recent introduction of Reverend Libby Lane as a woman Bishop inthe  Church of England has been hailed as a massive leap. The Church in Pakistan must stand up to protect the rights of women as well.

Pakistani Christian women have long held their 'peace' against the on-going abuse both at the hands of what they regard their family and the wider society, now is the time both for Church in Pakistan and State to provide justice and equality to Christian women who can live their respectful lives both in the eyes of the law and in society.

Speak now but never hold your peace.

109808052412959_844361812290909,"JERUSALEM, Israel - Canada's foreign minister has spent part of this week in Israel ahead of that country's national elections.

Just ahead of his arrival Israel's foreign minister said he would demand Baird  cut Canada's funding of the International Criminal Court.

""We will demand of our friends in Canada, in Australia and in Germany simply to stop funding it,"" Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israel Radio last Sunday. ""This body represents no one. It is a political body,"" he said.

""There are  quite a few countries, I've already taken telephone calls about this, that also think there is no justification for this body's existence,"" he added. The Israeli foreign minister said he would take the matter up with his Canadian counterpart who was visiting Israel.

The ICC on the Friday before Mr Lieberman's statement announced it would carry out a preliminary investigation into alleged war crimes committed in the Palestinian territories in July and August 2014. ""The Office will conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality,"" the ICC said in a statement issued at the time.

Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird was quick to respond to Israel's request for support on the issue, weighing in on the ICC and declaring Canada would take steps to get the ICC Court to reverse its decision. He did not however make any commitment to reducing funding to the international body, whose foundation was supported by Canada saying that was a decision for the government and not him alone.

""This is wrong on so many levels,"" he told media on his arrival in Israel. ""First and foremost, Israel, every time it comes under attack, seems to have to have one hand tied behind its back. And what this seems to do is tie the other hand behind its back.""

""And secondly,"" he said, ""the ICC is not to be used where there are mechanisms for domestic judicial processes and review. And obviously, Israel has one of the most independent judiciaries in the world,"" he said.

Baird confirmed Canada had ""filed an objection"" with the court.

""We are going to speak out forcefully against this decision, and try to get it turned around,"" he said.

""It's tough, but we just fundamentally have a major problem with this decision.""

Canada, like Israel goes to the polls this year. Asked by reporters if the Stephen Harper-led government's tough pro-Israel stance would impact on his own country's elections, Baird said, ""We don't support Israel because it gets us votes.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/844361812290909/?type=3,2015-01-25 19:18:38,1,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_826565267403897,"The arts and entertainment world lost dozens of esteemed trailblazers who passed away in 2014.

The long list of obituaries includes Maya Angelou, Lauren Bacall, Sid Caesar, James Garner, Mike Nichols, Mickey Rooney, Pete Seeger, Elaine Stritch, Shirley Temple Black and Eli Wallach.

But it was the shocking deaths of Robin Williams, Diem Brown, Peaches Geldof, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Elizabeth Pena, Harold Ramis, Joan Rivers, L'Wren Scott and Misty Upham that captured some of the year's most intense media attention.

Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead Feb. 2, lying on the bathroom floor of his Manhattan apartment. Officials deemed his death an accident due to acute mixed drug intoxication. The Oscar-winning actor and a recovering drug addict, who relapsed after about 20 years of sobriety, left behind a longtime partner and three young children, as well as a body of work that includes The Master, the Hunger Games film franchise, Capote, Boogie Nights and Twister. He was 46.

Comic actor, director and writer Harold Ramis died Feb. 24 in Chicago after a long battle with autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis. He was 69. He wrote the screenplay for the 1978 comedy Animal House, then went on to write hit comedies starring Bill Murray, including Meatballs, Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day. Ramis also acted in and served as producer on Meatballs, Stripes, Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II. His death finally put to rest speculation he and Murray would reunite on-screen with Dan Aykroyd for a third Ghostbusters flick. An all-female reboot of the franchise is in the works.

The body of fashion designer L'Wren Scott was discovered March 17 by her assistant, hanging from a scarf tied to a doorknob in her Manhattan apartment. The 47-year-old stunner was famous for dressing the likes of Nicole Kidman, Amy Adams, Christina Hendricks and Penelope Cruz for red-carpet events. She also had been rock star Mick Jagger's girlfriend since 2001.

Model, journalist and TV personality Peaches Geldof died of a heroin overdose April 7 at her home in southeast England. She was the 25-year-old daughter of Irish rocker Bob Geldof and Welsh TV host Paula Yates, who died in 2000 of a heroin overdose at age 41. Peaches Geldof is survived by her  husband and two toddler sons.

Robin Williams, the Oscar-winning star of Good Will Hunting and arguably one of the funniest men in the world, hung himself Aug. 11 in his San Francisco-area home. He was 63. In addition to his legendary stand-up comedy and film-acting careers, Williams also starred in the TV sitcoms Mork  Mindy and The Crazy Ones. He, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg hosted a series of Comic Relief television specials, which raised money for the homeless, as well. The cherished entertainer, who had battled depression for most of his life, had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease shortly before his death.

Known as well for her quest to look young as she was for her unapologetic sense of humor, standup comedienne and Fashion Police panelist Joan Rivers died Sept. 4 of a therapeutic complication during a routine medical procedure. Her daughter hired a law firm in October to investigate the death as she reportedly plans to sue the clinic where the vivacious 81-year-old was being treated when she fell into a coma. She was taken off life support days later.

La Bamba and Modern Family actress Elizabeth Pena died of a heart attack Oct. 14 in Los Angeles, while suffering cirrhosis of the liver and acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Just 55 when she passed away, she had an enviable resume that included appearances in the films Jacob's Ladder and Rush Hour, and a starring role in the 1980s sitcom I Married Dora.
 
The body of 32-year-old Native American actress Misty Upham was discovered Oct. 16 at the bottom of a wooded embankment near the White River in Auburn, Wash. She died of blunt force injury to the head and torso Oct. 5, the day her family said she disappeared. The circumstances of her death remain under investigation, however officials have said there is no evidence of foul play. Upham's star had been on the rise at the time of her death with memorable roles in the acclaimed films Django Unchained and August: Osage County. Although her relatives said she had a history of mental illness, they have maintained she would not have committed suicide.  

The Real World family mourned the losses of alumni Diem Brown and Ryan Knight this year. Brown died Nov .14 at age 34 after a long battle with cancer. She was the star of the reality shows Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Fresh Meat, The Duel, The Gauntlet III, The Duel 2, The Ruins and Battle of the Exes. She was originally diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2003, beat it, then relapsed in 2012. Brown discovered she had colon cancer in August, and the disease spread to her liver and lymph nodes. She chronicled her experiences in a blog for People, and remained optimistic about her future. Two weeks after her death, her fellow Real World veteran Knight was found dead at a friend's house in Wisconsin, reportedly after a night of heavy drinking. An autopsy performed on his body proved inconclusive, however Knight's family said he had been complaining about stomach problems in the days leading up to his death.

Heartfelt goodbyes were also said this year to a trio of titans from Hollywood's Golden Age of the 1930s and '40s. 

One of the most famous child stars of all time, Shirley Temple Black, died Feb. 10 at her home in Woodside, Calif. She was 85. From 1935 to 1939, Temple was the most popular movie star in America, and more photos were snapped of her than of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She retired from acting at age 22 after starring in 23 motion pictures and winning an Honorary Oscar at age 6. Her film credits include Bright Eyes, Heidi, Little Miss Marker and The Little Princess. Following her marriage to Charles Alden Black in 1950, she began raising funds for the Republican Party and eventually served as U.S. ambassador to Ghana from 1974 to 1976. Black went on to become President George H. W. Bush's ambassador to Czechoslovakia in 1989 and was on the job during the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.

Mickey Rooney died of natural causes April 6 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 93. His career in show business spanned nine decades and included 16 Andy Hardy movies and numerous collaborations with Judy Garland. He also shared the screen with Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet, Spencer Tracy in Boys Town and Ben Stiller in Night at the Museum. He won an Emmy, two Golden Globes and an Honorary Oscar, married eight women, including actress Ava Gardner, and fathered nine children. Later in life, he became a vocal advocate against elder abuse.

Lauran Bacall died Aug. 12 following a massive stroke. She was 89. The actress was married to film legend Humphrey Bogart from 1945 until his death in 1957. Their big-screen collaborations include the classics To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage and Key Largo. She also appeared in the movies How to Marry a Millionaire and Designing Woman. She earned an Oscar nod for her performance in 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces and was presented with a lifetime achievement Academy Award in 2009. She is survived by her three children -- two from her marriage to Bogart and one from her marriage to her ex-husband, actor Jason Robards, who died in 2000.

Two stars best known for their work in the 1950's, '60s and '70s also passed away this year.

Eli Wallach died of natural causes June 24 at age 98. In 1951, Wallach won a Tony Award for his performance in Tennessee Williams' The Rose Tattoo. He went on to star in popular movies like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The Magnificent Seven and The Godfather: Part III.

Maverick and The Rockford Files star James Garner died at age 86 of natural causes July 19 at his home in Los Angeles. His film credits incude The Americanization of Emily, The Great Escape, Support Your Local Sheriff, Victor/Victoria, Murphy's Romance, My Fellow Americans and The Notebook. He also co-starred in the 2000s TV sitcom Eight Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter.

The publishing world celebrated the lives and mourned the deaths of actress, civil rights activist and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings author Maya Angelou, who died May 28 at age 86; as well as her fellow literary lioness P.D. James, who wrote Children of Men and Death Comes to Pemberley, and died Nov. 27 at 94.   

Folk singer-songwriter Pete Seeger, who wrote ""If I Had a Hammer,"" ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"" and ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone"" died Jan. 27. He was 94. Seeger became a fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s and had a string of hit records in the early 1950s as a member of the Weavers folk music quartet. Members of the Weavers were blacklisted during the McCarthy Era. In the 1960s, Seeger re-emerged as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights and environmental causes. He was one of the folk singers who popularized the spiritual ""We Shall Overcome"" during the 1960s civil rights movement. 

Other luminaries who left died n 2014 include radio icon Casey Kasem; filmmakers Richard Attenborough and Mike Nichols; comedy legends Roberto Gomez Bolanos, David Brenner, Sid Caesar, John Pinnette and Elaine Stritch; classic sitcom stars Russell Johnson and Ann B. Davis; fashion giant Oscar De La Renta; authors Norman Bridwell and Mark Strand; musicians Phil Everly, Bobby Keys, Tommy Ramone and Bobby Womack; actors Bob Hoskins, James Rebhorn and Maximilain Schell; actresses Ruby Dee and Juanita Moore; and producer Saul Zaentz.Karen Butler",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/826565267403897/?type=3,2014-12-26 17:46:01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_821870924539998,"""This is not who we are. This is not how we operate,"" were the words of President Barack Obama commenting on the grisly findings of a long-awaited congressional report on the use of torture by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). But what if this is exactly who we are?

The report is difficult to read, not just because it is awfully long - hundreds of pages of a summary of a nearly 6,000-page investigation, including 38,000 citations based on the review of six million pages - but because it was most disturbing. Parts of it resemble the horror of an extremely dark Hollywood movie. But it was all real: from rectal feeding (as in putting hummus in detainee's rectums), to rape, to torturing prisoners to death, to blinding prisoners, to forcing them to stand on broken feet, for days. It is beyond ghastly.

Also, it was all useless. Worse, it strongly believed that the torture dungeons, many of which were outsourced to other countries, including 25 in Europe, including the democracy and human rights-touting Britain, have achieved little but fabricated information. What else can an innocent man say when he has nothing to say; but lie, hoping that maybe such lies would save his life?

Of course, aging accused war criminals like former Vice President, Dick Cheney were quick to dismiss the report and its detailed brutal interrogation tactics as ""full of crap.""

Without a shred or remorse, he told Fox News Channel on 10 December, a day after the report was released: ""What happened here was that we asked the agency to go take steps and put in place programs that were designed to catch the bastards who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11 and make sure it never happened again, and that's exactly what they did.""

It matters little that these ""steps"" killed innocent people, violated US and international law, and, equally importantly, lead to nothing but confessions under the duress of torture.

Cheney's complete disregard for human rights and international law is not the exception, but very much defines US attitude towards seemingly unimportant matters as law and due process in its most destructive so-called war on terror. His attitude was echoed repeatedly by many others, who insist on the US's moral superiority, yet without providing a shred of evidence to validate such an assertion.

Although one is relieved that the truth was, at least partly, laid bare, thanks to the persistent efforts of members in the Senate Intelligence Committee, the resulting discourse is still disturbing. Aside from the fact that top officials insist that there will be no prosecution for the war criminals, the language of President Obama and others promise little soul searching ahead.

""This is not who we are,"" said Obama.

Yet, John O. Brennan, the director of the CIA still defended the agency's use of the brutal tactics in American gulags, ""sidestepping questions about whether agency operatives tortured anyone,"" according to the New York Times.

""The 'lunch tray' for one detainee, which contained hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts and raisins, 'was 'pureed' and rectally infused,"" the report said.

""This is not how we operate,"" Obama said. But how do ""we"" exactly operate when the report was the outcome of 6 million documents? That is 6,000,000. There can no longer be a ""few bad apples"" argument made here, as the horrors of Abu Ghraib were once justified.

These practices were carried out for years. It involved numerous personnel. Numerous prisons. Many countries, including almost the entirety of Europe, and some of the biggest human rights violators on earth, including Middle Eastern and African countries. It was financed by a mammoth budget, and continues to be defended, brazenly by those who ordered them, who are unlikely to see their day in court.

Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, was adamant in her rejection of CIA torture. The program was ""morally, legally and administratively misguided (and) far more brutal than people were led to believe,"" she told the Senate.

Fair enough. But then this, the torture program is ""a stain on our values and on our history.""

There is this stubborn insistence on highlighting the same kind of moral superiority, contrary to all evidence. But isn't the whole so-called war on terror, and the continued American military involvement in the Middle East, the lethal unmanned drone program, which has killed thousands, the unconditional support for Israel and all sorts of oppressive regimes, and much more, all ""morally, legally and administratively misguided.""?

Between Cheney's bullying attitude and Obama's/Feinstein's, which claims that the massive, outsourced program is merely a ""stain"" on otherwise perfect American values, the report is unlikely to change much. Justice is unlikely to be served.

There can be no serious rethink and moral awakening without talking full responsibility, not just of vile torture tactics, but the entirety of the US's misguided foreign policy which is predicated on violence, and lots of it.

""I will leave to others how they might want to label these activities,"" Brennan said.

The report indicated that detainees were tortured before they were even asked to cooperate. How does one label that Mr. Brennan? Even by the logic of those who torture, such tactics are senseless.

Should some insist on the old, tired ""few bad apples"" argument, the report indicated that in ""Detention Site Green"" CIA interrogators objected to the continued use of torture, before they were told to carry on by their seniors. No few bad apples. The whole barrel is rotten.

There can be no justification to what the US has done, not just against suspects in its global wars, but against entire nations, who were completely innocent of any involvement in any terror attacks on 11 September, prior or after that date.

But CIA torture being a ""stain"" on an otherwise flawless record doesn't suffice either. In fact, in some way, this logic is the heart of the problem, since it blocks any attempt at honest reading of whatever ""values"" Washington stands for, and tries to achieve, using ""soft diplomacy"" of ""rectal feeding.""

What is equally worrying to what the report has contained is the existing mindset in the US, among the ruling class and the media.

This reality can be best summarised in the words of a Fox News show co-host, Andrea Tantaros: ""The United States of America is awesome, we are awesome,"" she exclaimed.

""The reason they want to have this discussion is not to show how awesome we are. This administration wants to have this discussion to show us how we're not awesome.""

With such overriding thoughtless mindset, there is little evidence to show that such ""awesomeness"" will cease anytime soon, even if at the expense of many innocent people.

109808052412959_820964904630600,"Nearly 100 children were among a staggering 126 people killed when heavily armed terrorists launched a brazen attack on an army-run school in Pakistan's Peshawar city Tuesday.

The horrifying attack comes amidst political turmoil in the country and just a day after the hostage crisis at a cafe in Australia's Sydney city.

Around six heavily armed militants first set a vehicle on fire and then stormed the Army Public School building located at Warsik Road in Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, ARY news reported.

Television footage showed the school children shocked and in tears. Some of them had blood on their faces. One of the students was carried away on a stretcher while another leaned onto a security personnel who helped him away.

The frightened children recalled the horror.

""It was the fourth period. We were in our classes. They were carrying guns in their hands,"" a young school student told the media.

""Our principal told our teacher that the students have to be evacuated. Suddenly we saw army personnel arriving,"" the student said.

The wounded and bloodied were carried away while anxious parents waited for news outside.

Over 500 students and teachers were trapped inside the building, with eyewitnesses saying they saw some of the wounded lying in the corridors.

A school teacher said that around 1,400 to 1,500 students study at the school.

Soon after the gunmen struck, a suicide bomber among them blew himself up outside the school auditorium.

Unconfirmed reports said that the auditorium was packed with students who were taking their exams.

The students were initially under the impression that it was yet another army drill and the horror sank in only after they saw school mates being hit by bullets.

The school teachers apparently tried to shepherd the children to safety. Some were able to flee soon after the attack began at noon, while a few others were taken out to safety by the security personnel who responded promptly.

The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility  and called it a revenge attack for the army operations in North Waziristan.

The guerrillas carried out the attack on the school that is normally well guarded and is considered secure.

Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) has confirmed that the children and staff were being evacuated from the building.

Some children said that the men attacked the auditorium where they were appearing for their examinations.

Uday, a lab assistant at the school, said: ""I was hiding for one hour. The army came. They numbered six-seven. They had big rifles.""

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pervez Khattak have condemned the violent incident and ordered the safe rescue of the children trapped inside the school.

Sharif has directed Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan to coordinate the rescue operation in Peshawar with security forces to ensure all possible help that needs to be extended to them.

Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) leader Sirajul Haq has condemned the incident and said that the whole country stood with the families of the deceased, Dawn online reported.

""Attack on innocent children in the name of religion is not acceptable,"" Haq tweeted.

All the injured have been shifted to Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar.

The injured students were writhing in pain. A child who was swathed in bandages was in tears as he narrated the terror attack.

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Governor Sardar Mehtab Abbasi has also been directed to ensure all possible assistance to security forces in the rescue operation.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/820964904630600/?type=3,2014-12-16 07:12:48,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0

The attack took late morning on Monday at sunny, secluded Port Douglas, near Cairns in Australia's Queensland. 

Daniel Smith, who was almost 18, was spearfishing with two mates at Rudder Reef, north of Port Douglas, when he was attacked.

Frantic efforts by his friends performing CPR while transporting him to shore failed to revive him. An emergency helicopter was called in by emergency services, however it was in use in another patient-transfer situation. An ambulance rushed Daniel to hospital, however it was around two hours later that it arrived at the hospital where Daniel was pronounced dead.

Ambulance officials say the non-availability of the helicopter was not a factor in the boy's death, given the severity of his injuries.

Daniel recently completed his Year 12 schooling at the nearby Mossman High School.

""We're a close-knit family and this will affect everyone in some way as we try to comprehend this tragedy,"" Douglas Shire mayor Julia Leu said Tuesday.

Several hostages including a men and women ran out of Lindt Chocolate Cafe just after the police operation began around 2.30 a.m. with three bangs that were followed by dozens of gunfire shots.

Within minutes, several hostages were carried away on stretchers by police personnel and para-medics.

The New South Wales Police advised media the Sydney siege was over.

It was later revealed three people had been killed. one of those killed was the lone gunman responsible for the siege. Two of the hostages, a 34-year old man and a 38-year old woman were also killed. Four others were taken to hospital including a police officer who was shot in the face. A woman hostage is also hospitalised with a gunshot wound to the shoulder, while two other women have more moderate injuries. None of those injured are in a life-threatening position, New South Wales Police confirmed in a statement issued around 5:30am Tuesday.

The gunman was named as Iran-born cleric Man Haron Monis, who was granted asylum in Australia in 1996.

The family of Infosys employee Ankireddy Vishwakant told the media in Andhra Pradesh that he had been rescued and was safe.

Vishwakant, who was recently granted Australian citizenship, stopped at the cafe on his way to work when the gunman took him and 29 others hostage, his family said.

The chilling incident, days ahead of Christmas, took place in Sydney's central business district and barely 400 meters from the Indian Consulate, which was promptly evacuated.

Also located in the vicinity the Reserve Bank of Australia and studios belonging to Sydney's Chennel Seven television network.

The court in Cairo saw widespread applause when the judge ruled that Mubarak should not have been a defendant in the case, as the charges against him were added too late.

In the same session, charges against seven former senior officials were also dropped, but both decisions could be appealed, according to reports.

The loves ones of victims waiting outside the court expressed frustration and anger, with leading human rights and democracy campaigners saying the ruling was a major blow to the liberation movement in the country.

After, the ruling, an ailing Mubarak, who is now 86-years-old, said he had done ""nothing wrong at all"" in the deaths of the protesters. It is alleged that he ordered police and security forces to use deadly force against demonstrators during the uprising.

Mubarak is serving a separate three-year sentence for embezzlement of public funds, but is currently being held in a military hospital, and is expected to serve at least a few more months of that sentence.
Mubarak, along with his former Interior Minister, Habib al-Adly, and six others had been convicted of conspiracy to kill and were sentenced to life in prison in June 2012, but a retrial was ordered last year on a technicality.

Around 800 people are thought to have been killed as security forces tried to prevent protesters taking to the streets in the weeks before Mubarak resigned on February 11th 2011.

The court documents at the retrial, however, related to the deaths of 239 people and injuries sustained by 1,588, across 11 regions of Egypt.
In the same court session, Mubarak was also cleared of a corruption charge involving gas exports to Israel.

The ruling comes after his sons Gamal and Alaa were cleared of separate corruption charges by the same court on Saturday.
Mubarak's lawyer, Farid al-Deeb, told the AFP news agency the verdict was a ""good ruling that proved the integrity of Mubarak's era"".
Later the former president, who ruled Egypt for several decades and provoked protests when he tried to extend his powers, gave an interview by phone to private Sada al-Balad TV.

""I did nothing wrong at all,"" he said. The former president, who come consider to have been a dictator, added that he was ""relying on God"" as he waited for the second verdict in the case.

Relatives of those killed in the 2011 uprising, part of a wider Arab Spring uprising across the Arab world, reacted with anger.
""There is no justice for the poor,"" Ramadan Ahmed, who lost his son Mohammed in Alexandria during the revolution, told the Associated Press. ""This is Mubarak's law.""

A member of the activist group April 6th Youth Movement told the BBC that the verdict dealt a major blow to the Egyptian revolution and undermined the defense of human rights in the country.
""It brings into question the judiciary system in Egypt, whether it is able to... defend the rights of other people,"" said Mahmoud Bashar.
President Mohammed Morsi was elected after Mubarak's resignation, but his government lasted only a year in power before being ousted by the military in July 2013 during mass anti-government protests.

A day after fighting back tears while making his statement to the press on behalf of his team and support staff at the SCG, Clarke opened up about the tragic death of his close friend.

Clarke wrote that he wants to use the occasion of this, Hughes' 26th birthday, to shine a bit more light onto Phillip, the man he was and the life he led, which would help explain the extraordinary outpouring of support from inside, and outside, the world cricket family, News.com.au reported.

Clarke added that Hughes' cricketing achievements, of which there were many, really play second fiddle to the human qualities that he exhibited. He also revealed that Hughes was loyal to a fault, eternally optimistic, kind hearted, wicked sense of humour, a child like verve for life, adding that he really could go on and on.

Clarke wrote about the first time he met his teammate, saying that he Hughes as a boy of 17, when he came down to Sydney from Macksville to play for his club Western Suburbs.

The skipper claimed that he was drawn to the late batsman instantly, falling for his cheeky grin and love of life, adding that Hughes truly was uncomplicated, what one saw was what one got.

Clarke was among thousands to wish Hughes a happy birthday on Sunday, starting the countdown two hours and six minutes before Hughes' birthday, tweeting that in two hours and six minutes it would be his brother's 26th Bday, adding that please 'get yourself a drink and raise your glass!'

Just before midnight, Clarke posted again, saying that everyone should get ready as it is seven minutes until his brother's birthday.
And then, as the clock struck 12, Clarke once again revealed the pain he has been going through as he comes to terms with the tragic death of his friend and former teammate.

First thing Sunday morning, Clarke continued to pay tribute to Hughes, posting a series of touching images on Instagram, this less than 24 hours after delivering a heartbreaking statement on behalf of himself and the Australian cricket team.

Hughes was honoured with a moment's applause at the Rugby union Test match the Wallabies and Twickenham overnight, as tributes flowed around the world. As well as the mass round of applause from a capacity crowd at the kick-off, a picture of Hughes was displayed on the giant screens at Twickenham.

The Australia team wore black armbands in memory of Hughes.

109808052412959_812241902169567,"The words were not only being sung for him - but only because of him. Belted out with rarely seen vigour and joy, from faces of strangers he had never laid eyes on eight hours ago.

All the while, the little blond kid in the corner smiled innocently. Not sure what to make of it all. Almost embarrassed being the centre of attention. Not quite game enough to try to fumble over the lyrics on a sheet someone had shoved in front of him moments earlier.

Who could blame him? He had barely spoken a word all day, let alone feel the urge to break out in full voice now.

Moments before this raucous gathering in outdated sheds for the traditional team song, which rendered the end-of-season beers so much sweeter that night, the same little blond kid proved he had a flair for the dramatic, long before the diamond earrings surfaced.

Scenario: one run to win, six balls remaining, six wickets in hand. Easy enough, huh? Especially when a bush kid - small in stature but big on reputation - is pounding grizzly veterans to all parts.

Ask them and they will tell you it wasn't supposed to be this way. Finals were on the line for them, a head start on the Silly Saturday celebrations the only thing that was supposed to matter for their opposition. But the little kid - 17, maybe 16 at the time, who knows? - didn't care for that.

This was his welcoming party to the big smoke and runs - truckloads of them - were the only gift he knew how to bring. Some had heard he could play before he arrived for a small taste of what was next, but no one really knew. Seeing is believing and all that shebang.

Thrust into the opening role and chasing a formidable 261 to win in a limited-overs fixture, the kid's talentless senior partner has edged off three balls in without scoring.

A few hours later the kid is still standing - on the brink of victory too - with a chanceless unbeaten 135. Cuts, flicks, lofted drives - the innings had it all. Except the winning run.

Back to that last over. Field is up. An air of resignation permeates for the bowling side. The kid has pasted them all over the park and there will surely be two teams - rather than the forecast one - on Silly Saturday watch tonight. What was another single to him?

Dot to start.

Followed by the same.

Then another. Aaah, don't worry. Still three balls to score one run, with six wickets in the sheds no less.

Fourth ball? Dot again. What is going on here? Surely the kid can't stumble at the final hurdle. He has run his own marathon and surely the red light isn't flashing at the 41-kilometre mark?

Fifth ball? Dot again. Cue incredulous teammates on the boundary. Delicate late cuts, pure drives, deft glances. The kid has tried to use them all this over, ostensibly bloody-minded in not sacrificing his wicket in the whirl of trying to hit the winning runs.

But your team need one measly run off the last over and you haven't tried to loft one single delivery over an infield so close they could be charged with trespass for encroaching on a pitch you have owned all afternoon!

OK, here it is. Last ball. The kid cannot possibly blow this now, leaving behind the greatest dot-to-dot puzzle in cricketing history. Right?

Whack!

This time there is an attempt to loft the ball.

This time it is out of the middle.

This time it does clear the field.

And this time it also clears the fence.

A six to win it off the last ball when all that it needed was a single off the first. But how boring would that have been?

The kid was Macksville's Phil Hughes, playing his first Sydney grade game for Western Suburbs' second XI in the last fixture of the 2005-06 season, and hitting a six off the last ball to endear himself to his new teammates.

Your columnist was his talentless opening partner who trudged off 49.3 overs earlier.

Globetrotting and domestic Big Pond clients are being blocked from sending emails when away from home. The problem, which is chronic, and has persisted for years is causing considerable disruption to travelling businesspeople and tourists. Invariably the problem occurs at hotels where Big Pond subscribers link up to the local hotel's wifi which is usually provided by an internationally recognized provider that specializes in supplying international hotel chains. The problem has hit major providers such as Ibahn and Docomo. Big Pond users are able to access the Internet for browsing and have no difficulty in receiving emails. The problem occurs when they try to send emails . They are blocked with messages saying their Big Pond IP address is on a spam blacklist, and is associated with the sending of spam emails. Subscribers are directed to sites such as www.spamhause.org or www.csi.cloudmark.com The spamhause messages include: ""(Big Pond IP address) is listed on the Exploits Block List (XBL)."" The cloudmark messages include messages such as ""Big Pond has a poor reputation on the Cloudmark Sender Intelligence (CSI) list."" Big Pond and its parent Telstra, Australia's biggest telco, despite years of the prevalence of the problem, has failed to resolve it. Ibahn and Docomo and others, together with major hotel groups including Hyatt, Starwood, Hilton, Accor,  and Marriott continue to spend thousands of hours each year liasing with hotel guest, taking them through various routines to try and find a temporary fix. Big Pond customers are encouraged to change settings on their computer, always to no effect. Providers often provide their own mail server, again to little effect. The Docomo IT manager for New Zealand recently flew from Auckland to Queenstown to that city's Hilton Hotel in a bid to resolve one client's concern, in an effort to find a solution once and for all. Despite numerous approaches the IT manager had to concede the problem could not be fixed in isolation from the IP provider (Big Pond). The guest had to check out of the hotel. The Docomo representative said the problem was cropping up more and more and invariably it involved guests with Big Pond accounts. On the Big Pond Help page subscribers are told the problem is the IP address the customer is using and the customer should try and change the IP by logging out, turning off their computer and logging back in. The suggestion is ineffective as the nominated IP address is not blocked in isolation, but rather the entire range of associated IP addresses is invariably blocked. Users are then encouraged to search for a Trojan or virus on their computer, an erroneous suggestion as the problem is almost never with the subscriber's computer. Telstra, Australia's largest and longest-established telecommunications provider, and parent of Big Pond, acknowledged our advance notice of publishing this story and while initially inferred it would provide a response within the time or publication, ultimately elected not do so.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/803042823089475/?type=3,2014-11-11 11:46:00,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_795095790550845,"Israeli defense minister Moshe Ya'alon has given in to demands by Israeli colonists to ban Palestinian workers in the West Bank from using Israeli public transportation services. Under the new rules, Palestinians will be unable to avail themselves of direct bus services from the central region to the occupied West Bank and will instead have to arrive at the Eyal Crossing, near Qalqilyah, which is a long way from colonist areas, and travel to their final destinations on alternative transportation from there.

Palestinians serve as a cheap labour force for Israel and many of them cross into occupied territories on a daily basis to earn a living, having to spend hours at border crossings in often difficult conditions.

At present, the Eyal Crossing is the only entry point for Palestinians who work in central Israel. At the crossing, they are subjected to stringent security checks.

In the past, the workers had been able to return to the West Bank through a number of crossings. Some Palestinians from the central areas of the West Bank use buses which take the so-called ""trans-Samaria"" road through the Jewish colony of Ariel and on to their villages. It is this route which is being particularly affected by the new restrictions.

Palestinian workers are not permitted to stay back overnight in Israel.

Palestinians have called the Israeli decision 'racist' and have prepared an official letter to be submitted to the World Labour Organisation about it.
""Our letter will show the organisation and the world the Israeli racism and the brutality of the occupation,"" said Shaher Sa'ad, who heads the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions, Workers and Labourers, in an interview with Gulf News.

He said that Palestinian workers do not usually prefer to take the buses to the West Bank colonies. ""The colonists are usually fully armed and constitute a real threat to Palestinian labourers and the Palestinian labourers prefer to stay away from them,"" said Sa'ad.

""Had this issue been left alone by a senior Israeli official like the Israeli Defence Minister, it would have declined as the number of Palestinian labourers who use those bus lines is small and is actually decreasing because Palestinian labourers feel unsafe beside the Israeli colonists.""

Of the approximately 40,000 Palestinians who enter Israel for work daily from the West Bank, a total of 28,000 labourers hold official and legal work permits. Of this number, only 3,000 Palestinians use the Israeli bus lines to get to their home villages and towns.

Sa'ad said that Palestinian workers use some bus lines which lead to key colonies like Ariel as such buses pass by their villages and towns near the city of Salfit.

Sa'ad said that the Palestinian workers usually follow set routes to reach their homes after finishing work. Mini buses on these routes are driven by Palestinians living in Israel, who drive the workers to the crossings, he added. After passing the crossing, the workers board Palestinian vehicles.
""Huge numbers of Palestinians [citizens of Israel] have specialised in transporting the Palestinian labourers and there have been several bus station-like stops in different areas inside Israel to load the labourers and drive them to the crossings,"" Sa'ad said.

He added that the Israelis have already implemented the segregationist and racist decision by appointing inspectors at bus stations to prevent Palestinian workers from getting on buses.

Whitlam had served as the 21st Prime Minister of Australia for a period of three years starting from Dec 5, 1972.

He was the Leader of the Labor Party from 1967 to 1977.

Hi wife Margaret, his childhood sweetheart died in 2012.

""Gough ended conscription, the death penalty and he made Advance Australia Fair our national anthem,"" said Shorten. ""He put our suburbs at the centre of national debate.""

""Gough Whitlam spent his entire political life reaching for higher ground, he redefined our country and changed the life of a generation, and generations beyond.""

""He inspired us all in some way and he will continue to inspire us,"" added the current Australian opposition leader.

""There will be more tears shed for Gough Whitlam today than perhaps any other leader in Australian history.""

The reaction of Israelis however is not one of remorse or concern about international opinion, it is one of anger.

On Tuesday UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Gaza to inspect the damage caused by the recent 51-day war. ""I am here with a heavy heart,"" he told a news conference. ""The destruction which I have seen coming here is beyond description.""

Not exactly a revelation, but it was enough to send the readers of Israel's most respected and widely read newspaper, The Jerusalem Post, into a frenzy. Readers rushed to attack the UN official venting their rage in unprecedented fashion.

""The man-in-the-moon is just another in a long line of UN diplo-dopes who refuse to acknowledge the obvious connection between cause and effect: If you fire anything at tiny Israel, then the IDF will return fire,"" MJC wrote in one of the milder rebukes.

Ralph Miller was a little more outspoken: ""Well Panky Moon.... if you had come to Israel and opened your mouth when Hamas rockets were attacking israeli civilians maybe you could have helped BEFORE Israel was forced to defend its citizens. Actually the world didn't hear a single word from you about THAT. And since you have been in Gaza you haven't said a word about it either.""

JordanKratz had this to say: ""Gaza got exactly what it asked for. If it asks for more Israel will be more than happy to do so. Ban-Give-A-Moon go crawl to your Palis......why not help them hide more weapons. BAN next time they start up maybe Israel will finally turn them into a large crater.""

""Gaza destruction is not ""beyond description."" It is simply what all of Israel would look like if Hamas was successful. In that case, Moon would not even give it a second glance,"" shref40 wrote.

eli_feruch said, ""Ban is a dwarf with no power at all. He is just the best valet chosen by the US. He is nothing. obama and kerry keep spreading their vile words on Israel. outrageous. now openly discussing how the Israeli should think and giving in 100% in Hamas narrative.""

""The greatest civilian killers US administration of all times makes friend with Iran and Hamas. it kinda makes sense. right now the US are having fun bombing the Syrian civilians. but who cares about the Syrians right? who cares about the africans.""

""As of your argument Kerry, bald shameful guy, the ""whole world"" thing against Israel, this miserable argument of yours, coward, Israel and the Jewish people in Israel know perfectly well the intention of Your ""whole world"" concenring Jews. Back off wig man and take your terrorist Qatari and Iranian with you.""

David too was unimpressed. ""It's beyond description? are you for real? antisemitic one sided statement from a world class a$$hole... ho hum,"" he wrote.

""Moon can now shut up. He just acknowledged his inability to describe the landscape in any meaningful unbiased way,"" said Stoller81611.

""Monkey Moon said for ""the people of Palestine"" where is that? There is not such a place on the map. I think he needs to learn more about history,"" said disqus_klVTfzqwTM.

""You have disrespected the MONKEY,"" jordankratz responded. ""The MONKEY is an awesome animal. Ban Give-A-Moon is better as he always shows his ass instead of his brain.""

disqus_klVTfzqwTM  chimed in again with: ""Monkey Moon is bias, just like the whole UN. Why didn't Moon visit the traumatized Israeli children, traumatized families and hospital that were attacked by Hamas? The airport and cities that were paralyzed for 8 years? Imagine if NJ fires at NYC and NYC puts all its inhabitants underground for years? ""NYC is closed for business???"" Just imagine. What would you do if your family were receiving rockets on their roofs every single day, to say the least. What would you do? Naturally, Israel protected its citizens. Hamas started, Hamas must pay.""

truthstingz wrote: ""really ban? it's always been a sh\thole or did you miss that the last times you were there...?... the f-tard leadership makes sure to take care of themselves, but let their people live in their own vomit.. so how is it any worse when it was already like this to begin with? or you mean the areas where these thugz were shooting their missiles from, like UN facilities, hopitals and schools... go f yourself.""

""unfortunately Israel was to soft, it should have been much worse,"" Mike Anderson said.

NL Shriber decried the international fundraising held recently in Gaza. ""Americans, Europeans, note how your money is being passed, without even a wink, directly to the hands and pockets of the Islamist warlords of Hamas that continues to rule all that is happening in Gaza.""

""P.S. Do know, the next rockets fired at the civilian population of Israel will be the result of your direct contribution to the warlords of Hamas!!"" the Jerusalem Post reader wrote.

Canjeero- Back from a ban responded: ""Can't be worse than the billions of food stamps given to the Israelis.""

Gkaplan had this to say: ""Such simplistic slogans from an ideologue. What handouts has Israel ever gotten from anyone? The dollars provided to Israel by the US are earmarked to be spent on armaments produced in the US. The US manufacturers are the beneficiaries of these funds.""

""While the Arabs of Gaza and the PLO are begging for billions to repair the damages that Hamas brought to the region by starting the war, and then not accepting any of the ceasefires offered, Israel has not asked for one cent from the international community for reparations (not that it would be forthcoming even if they had). Hamas and the PLO are global leaches. They don't produce anything but violence and misery for their own people.""

IsraLazer asked ""What do you expect from the head ""loone"" - head of the ""UNfunctioning Nations.""

benoNetanya wrote ""Secretaries are now in charge of the world, send this Haman to Syria just for the day, tell him it is Ramallah.""

conservatl added ""Note* there was nothing preventing Ban from visiting when hamas was storing weapons in UN facilities. When they were launching rockets behind civilian human shields. He could have stood a few KM from the border and admired the fireworks launched from there toward civilian targets and listen to the sirens. Interesting he was not there when the view would have been much more evident of the reality, instead of this mythic peace process he goes on about.""

Ban in his visit on Tuesday met with representatives of the Palestinian unity government.

'More than 1.8 million Palestinians live in Gaza, an area about 40 km long (25 miles) and 10 km wide at its widest point,' the Jerusalem Post article on Wednesday said.

'An estimated 20,000 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in the fighting, while the territory's power station and other major pieces of infrastructure were hit. Contractors say it could take years to rebuild,' the newspaper's article stated.

On Tuesday Israel allowed the first truck loaded with reconstruction materials to enter Gaza, the Jerusalem Post article reported.

The UN secretary-general's visit to the region follows a weekend conference in Cairo to raise funds to re-build Gaza.

The 51-day war that resulted in the destruction killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, including more than 500 children, and 70 Israelis.

The secretary general spoke with a number of victims in Gaza. ""I just met a man who lost his legs. He lost his brothers and sisters. It is very sad and heart-breaking,"" he said.

""My visit to Gaza has reinforced my conviction that there is no time to lose. There can be no peace in the Middle East, no security for Israel, while the crisis in Gaza festers,"" Ban said, insisting the ""build-destroy, build-destroy cycle must be broken.""

""The mindless pattern of blockade, rockets and destruction must stop. I repeat here in Gaza: the rockets fired by Hamas and other armed groups must end,"" he said.

The UN chief's schedule included a visit to an Israeli kibbutz in southern Israel, where he met with Israeli families who came under fire from rockets during the conflict.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/789082771152147/?type=3,2014-10-14 12:24:31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_786688274724930,"In transmitting President Richard Nixon's orders for a ""massive"" bombing of Cambodia in 1969, Henry Kissinger said, ""Anything that flies on everything that moves."" As Barack Obama ignites his seventh war against the Muslim world since he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the orchestrated hysteria and lies make one almost nostalgic for Kissinger's murderous honesty.
As a witness to the human consequences of aerial savagery - including the beheading of victims, their parts festooning trees and fields - I am not surprised by the disregard of memory and history, yet again. A telling example is the rise to power of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge, who had much in common with today's Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). They, too, were ruthless medievalists who began as a small sect. They, too, were the product of an American-made apocalypse, this time in Asia.
According to Pol Pot, his movement had consisted of ""fewer than 5,000 poorly armed guerrillas uncertain about their strategy, tactics, loyalty and leaders"". Once Nixon's and Kissinger's B52 bombers had gone to work as part of ""Operation Menu"", the west's ultimate demon could not believe his luck.
The Americans dropped the equivalent of five Hiroshimas on rural Cambodia during 1969-73. They levelled village after village, returning to bomb the rubble and corpses. The craters left monstrous necklaces of carnage, still visible from the air. The terror was unimaginable. A former Khmer Rouge official described how the survivors ""froze up and they would wander around mute for three or four days. Terrified and half-crazy, the people were ready to believe what they were told That was what made it so easy for the Khmer Rouge to win the people over.""
A Finnish Government Commission of Enquiry estimated that 600,000 Cambodians died in the ensuing civil war and described the bombing as the ""first stage in a decade of genocide"". What Nixon and Kissinger began, Pol Pot, their beneficiary, completed. Under their bombs, the Khmer Rouge grew to a formidable army of 200,000.
ISIS has a similar past and present. By most scholarly measure, Bush and Blair's invasion of Iraq in 2003 led to the deaths of some 700,000 people - in a country that had no history of jihadism. The Kurds had done territorial and political deals; Sunni and Shia had class and sectarian differences, but they were at peace; intermarriage was common. Three years before the invasion, I drove the length of Iraq without fear. On the way I met people proud, above all, to be Iraqis, the heirs of a civilization that seemed, for them, a presence.
Bush and Blair blew all this to bits. Iraq is now a nest of jihadism. Al-Qaeda - like Pol Pot's ""jihadists"" - seized the opportunity provided by the onslaught of Shock and Awe and the civil war that followed. ""Rebel"" Syria offered even greater rewards, with CIA and Gulf state ratlines of weapons, logistics and money running through Turkey. The arrival of foreign recruits was inevitable. A former British ambassador, Oliver Miles, wrote recently, ""The [Cameron] government seems to be following the example of Tony Blair, who ignored consistent advice from the Foreign Office, MI5 and MI6 that our Middle East policy - and in particular our Middle East wars - had been a principal driver in the recruitment of Muslims in Britain for terrorism here.""
ISIS is the progeny of those in Washington and London who, in destroying Iraq as both a state and a society, conspired to commit an epic crime against humanity. Like Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, ISIS are the mutations of a western state terror dispensed by a venal imperial elite undeterred by the consequences of actions taken at great remove in distance and culture. Their culpability is unmentionable in ""our"" societies.
It is 23 years since this holocaust enveloped Iraq, immediately after the first Gulf War, when the US and Britain hijacked the United Nations Security Council and imposed punitive ""sanctions"" on the Iraqi population - ironically, reinforcing the domestic authority of Saddam Hussein. It was like a medieval siege. Almost everything that sustained a modern state was, in the jargon, ""blocked"" - from chlorine for making the water supply safe to school pencils, parts for X-ray machines, common painkillers and drugs to combat previously unknown cancers carried in the dust from the southern battlefields contaminated with Depleted Uranium.
Just before Christmas 1999, the Department of Trade and Industry in London restricted the export of vaccines meant to protect Iraqi children against diphtheria and yellow fever. Kim Howells, a medical doctor and parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Blair government, explained why. ""The children's vaccines"", he said, ""were capable of being used in weapons of mass destruction"". The British Government could get away with such an outrage because media reporting of Iraq - much of it manipulated by the Foreign Office - blamed Saddam Hussein for everything.
Under a bogus ""humanitarian"" Oil for Food Programme, $100 was allotted for each Iraqi to live on for a year. This figure had to pay for the entire society's infrastructure and essential services, such as power and water. ""Imagine,"" the UN Assistant Secretary General, Hans Von Sponeck, told me, ""setting that pittance against the lack of clean water, and the fact that the majority of sick people cannot afford treatment, and the sheer trauma of getting from day to day, and you have a glimpse of the nightmare. And make no mistake, this is deliberate. I have not in the past wanted to use the word genocide, but now it is unavoidable.""
Disgusted, Von Sponeck resigned as UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator in Iraq. His predecessor, Denis Halliday, an equally distinguished senior UN official, had also resigned. ""I was instructed,"" Halliday said, ""to implement a policy that satisfies the definition of genocide: a deliberate policy that has effectively killed well over a million individuals, children and adults.""
A study by the United Nations Children's Fund, Unicef, found that between 1991 and 1998, the height of the blockade, there were 500,000 ""excess"" deaths of Iraqi infants under the age of five. An American TV reporter put this to Madeleine Albright, US Ambassador to the United Nations, asking her, ""Is the price worth it?"" Albright replied, ""We think the price is worth it.""
In 2007, the senior British official responsible for the sanctions, Carne Ross, known as ""Mr. Iraq"", told a parliamentary selection committee, ""[The US and UK governments] effectively denied the entire population a means to live."" When I interviewed Carne Ross three years later, he was consumed by regret and contrition. ""I feel ashamed,"" he said. He is today a rare truth-teller of how governments deceive and how a compliant media plays a critical role in disseminating and maintaining the deception. ""We would feed [journalists] factoids of sanitised intelligence,"" he said, ""or we'd freeze them out.""
On 25 September, a headline in the Guardian read: ""Faced with the horror of Isis we must act."" The ""we must act"" is a ghost risen, a warning of the suppression of informed memory, facts, lessons learned and regrets or shame. The author of the article was Peter Hain, the former Foreign Office minister responsible for Iraq under Blair. In 1998, when Denis Halliday revealed the extent of the suffering in Iraq for which the Blair Government shared primary responsibility, Hain abused him on the BBC's Newsnight as an ""apologist for Saddam"". In 2003, Hain backed Blair's invasion of stricken Iraq on the basis of transparent lies. At a subsequent Labour Party conference, he dismissed the invasion as a ""fringe issue"".
Now Hain is demanding ""air strikes, drones, military equipment and other support"" for those ""facing genocide"" in Iraq and Syria. This will further ""the imperative of a political solution"". Obama has the same in mind as he lifts what he calls the ""restrictions"" on US bombing and drone attacks. This means that missiles and 500-pound bombs can smash the homes of peasant people, as they are doing without restriction in Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Somalia - as they did in Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. On 23 September, a Tomahawk cruise missile hit a village in Idlib Province in Syria, killing as many as a dozen civilians, including women and children. None waved a black flag.
The day Hain's article appeared, Denis Halliday and Hans Von Sponeck happened to be in London and came to visit me. They were not shocked by the lethal hypocrisy of a politician, but lamented the enduring, almost inexplicable absence of intelligent diplomacy in negotiating a semblance of truce. Across the world, from Northern Ireland to Nepal, those regarding each other as terrorists and heretics have faced each other across a table. Why not now in Iraq and Syria.
Like Ebola from West Africa, a bacteria called ""perpetual war"" has crossed the Atlantic. Lord Richards, until recently head of the British military, wants ""boots on the ground"" now. There is a vapid, almost sociopathic verboseness from Cameron, Obama and their ""coalition of the willing"" - notably Australia's aggressively weird Tony Abbott - as they prescribe more violence delivered from 30,000 feet on places where the blood of previous adventures never dried. They have never seen bombing and they apparently love it so much they want it to overthrow their one potentially valuable ally, Syria. This is nothing new, as the following leaked UK-US intelligence file illustrates:
""In order to facilitate the action of liberative [sic] forces a special effort should be made to eliminate certain key individuals [and] to proceed with internal disturbances in Syria. CIA is prepared, and SIS (MI6) will attempt to mount minor sabotage and coup de main [sic] incidents within Syria, working through contacts with individuals... a necessary degree of fear... frontier and [staged] border clashes [will] provide a pretext for intervention... the CIA and SIS should use... capabilities in both psychological and action fields to augment tension.""
That was written in 1957, though it could have been written yesterday. In the imperial world, nothing essentially changes. Last year, the former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas revealed that ""two years before the Arab spring"", he was told in London that a war on Syria was planned. ""I am going to tell you something,"" he said in an interview with the French TV channel LPC, ""I was in England two years before the violence in Syria on other business. I met top British officials, who confessed to me that they were preparing something in Syria Britain was organising an invasion of rebels into Syria. They even asked me, although I was no longer Minister for Foreign Affairs, if I would like to participate This operation goes way back. It was prepared, preconceived and planned.""
The only effective opponents of ISIS are accredited demons of the west - Syria, Iran, Hezbollah. The obstacle is Turkey, an ""ally"" and a member of Nato, which has conspired with the CIA, MI6 and the Gulf medievalists to channel support to the Syrian ""rebels"", including those now calling themselves ISIS. Supporting Turkey in its long-held ambition for regional dominance by overthrowing the Assad government beckons a major conventional war and the horrific dismemberment of the most ethnically diverse state in the Middle East.
A truce - however difficult to achieve - is the only way out of this imperial maze; otherwise, the beheadings will continue. That genuine negotiations with Syria should be seen as ""morally questionable"" (the Guardian) suggests that the assumptions of moral superiority among those who supported the war criminal Blair remain not only absurd, but dangerous.
Together with a truce, there should be an immediate cessation of all shipments of war materials to Israel and recognition of the State of Palestine. The issue of Palestine is the region's most festering open wound, and the oft-stated justification for the rise of Islamic extremism. Osama bin Laden made that clear. Palestine also offers hope. Give justice to the Palestinians and you begin to change the world around them.
More than 40 years ago, the Nixon-Kissinger bombing of Cambodia unleashed a torrent of suffering from which that country has never recovered. The same is true of the Blair-Bush crime in Iraq. With impeccable timing, Henry Kissinger's latest self-serving tome has just been released with its satirical title, ""World Order"". In one fawning review, Kissinger is described as a ""key shaper of a world order that remained stable for a quarter of a century"". Tell that to the people of Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Chile, East Timor and all the other victims of his ""statecraft"". Only when ""we"" recognise the war criminals in our midst will the blood begin to dry.

109808052412959_785328654860892,"A man who strangled his two young sons has pleaded guilty to their murder. Sanjeev Chada, 44, of Ballinkillen, Bagenalstown, Co Carlow, in Ireland, was to be tried in November however he entered a guilty plea at the Central Criminal Court on Tuesday afternoon.

It was an emotional day for Chada, who is confined to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, and his wife Kathleen, whose victim impact statement to the court Tuesday brought tears to many an eye.

Chada will now serve a life sentence in prison for the murder of his ten-year-old son Eoghan and his five-year-old son Ruairi at Rosbeg in Westport on 29 July last year.

The boys had spent the night away from their mother with their father to go bowling. However their father took them camping, and when they awoke he strangled them. The older boy apparently fought back as he was also hit by a blunt instrument. After killing them Chada stashed the boys' bodies in the boot of his car.

When the car was involved in an accident in Westport later in the day the bodies were discovered.

At that stage a nationwide search was underway for the boys and their father after they failed to return to the mother's home. When questioned by Gardai, Chada admitted to killing his sons. Asked why, he said: ""Because I love them so much."" When asked what it was all about he said: ""Money.""

The court was told Tuesday of a gambling problem Chada had. He had been trading stocks online, used his own funds and was under investigation for embezzling community funds.

He told Gardai he had planned to end his own life as well.

A psychiatric report said Chada had taken pride in being a role model for his sons.

The report said he suffered ""cognitive dissonance"" holding himself out to be a good family man while secretly getting into debt through his stock market trading addiction.

The court was told he has been on ""suicide watch"" for some time.

His wife Kathleen, in her victim impact statement said she had met Sanj Chada about 18 years ago. They got married 11-and-a-half years ago and went on to have Eoghan and Ruairi who were ten and five when they died. 

""I thought we were a normal, ordinary family. Blessed to have two beautiful healthy boys, a lovely home, and good family and friends around us,"" she said. 

""I thought I knew my husband. On Sunday the 28th
 of July 2013, Sanj brought me a cup of coffee in bed and I had a lie-in.""
 
""He made lunch that day and we watched a programme on healthy eating as it was something Eoghan in particular was interested in and both boys were learning about it in school. Sanj had said he would take the boys bowling for a treat and to let me have a break. It was a fairly typical Sunday. The boys finished off 
their favourite dinner of dahl and rice and off they went.""
 
""Little did I know that Sanj intended I never see any of them alive again. I question why he left me behind. I have to live with the belief he wanted me dead as well. He just didn't know how. I would have fought tooth and nail for my boys,"" Chada's wife Kathleen said. 

""Eoghan and Ruairi were bright, happy, sporty, popular, gorgeous boys who had their whole lives ahead of them. Their head mistress in school described them as having the full package, and boy did they.""
 
""Eoghan had so many plans for his future. He wanted to be a farmer like his uncle and Poppy. He also wanted to be a chef like another uncle. In fact, he and one of his best friends planned to open a restaurant together. And because they were so interested in magic, they wanted all the waiters and waitresses to learn magic tricks to entertain customers.""
 
""He also wanted to be a hurler and play for Kilkenny or Carlow. He hoped to be able to bring Carlow to Croke Park for an All-Ireland final one day. He did once get the opportunity to play in Croke Park with his local club Ballinkillen  he was so proud. He also wanted to be a golfer like Rory McIlroy. He couldn't wait to be old enough to play on a proper golf course and was so excited to have just become a member of Borris Golf Club on his tenth birthday at the end of June,"" Mrs. Chada told the court in her statement. 

""Ruairi just wanted to follow in Eoghan's footsteps. Everything Eoghan did, then he could do too. He had so much confidence because he always knew he had his big brother looking out for him. And I know Eoghan continues to do that now. I have no doubt in my mind that Eoghan fought for both their lives on that night last year.""
 
""They had everything to live for,"" Chada's wife said. ""So much potential cut down in such a cruel and violent way by their own father who they loved and adored. He was their hero.""
 
""How do I live with the knowledge of their last moments? How scared they must have been? Did they cry for me? Did they scream? Did they know what was happening? The betrayal of their love for Sanj is so painful for me to imagine. How can evil such as this have been hidden for so long in a seemingly loving father? How can he be so utterly, utterly selfish? They and I trusted him so totally.""
 
""In fact all during that long night last year, because he had the boys with him I was so sure he would be okay,"" Mrs Chada said. ""It never occurred to me that the boys were in danger from Sanj. How could they be? He was their father and loved them I thought. He has robbed us of so very, very much  me, our family and the boy's friends and the community. Who can ever know what potential the boys had in the future? It is all gone.""
 
""How can we ever understand or accept our loss? How do I explain to their friends and little cousins that we now have to bring a birthday cake and cards to a grave? How do I reassure them Santa and the tooth fairy do visit heaven but that we can't?""
 
""I am so very, very proud of my two boys. They touched so many lives in their short ones. Even their death has impacted so many. Their memory will continue to live on in Ballinkillen, in my heart and in the hearts of all who truly love them.""
 
""But how could Sanj have done this? I don't ask why anymore, just how? He even took Eoghan and Ruairi's last moments from me. Even though he is responsible for their deaths he got to hold them while they were still warm and then just dumped them in the boot of the car, taking all dignity from them and abandoning them.""

109808052412959_765400730187018,"Israel says it is appropriating 400 hectares of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank, possibly one of the biggest property takeovers for the Jewish state in decades. The Israeli military said it is declaring the land ""state-owned"" on orders from the country's political leaders, in response to the June killing of three Israeli teenagers who were kidnapped from a roadside near Bethlehem, in the southern area of the West Bank. 

Israel has named three Palestinians from Hebron as the suspects in the killings that helped ignite the 50-day war with Hamas militants who control the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The fighting was halted last week with an open-ended cease-fire, but the land appropriation drew an immediate rebuke from chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat. He called for diplomatic action against Israel, which he said is ""committing various crimes against the Palestinian people and their occupied land.""
Israel could create a new city called Gevaot on the land. A current settlement there has only 10 families.

A spokesman for the anti-settlement group Peace Now, Yariv Oppenheimer, said the settlement expansion will hurt the chances for further Israeli peace negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ""This new declaration of expansion of settlement by the Israeli government is very significant. We don't remember such a big announcement in the last one or two decades,"" said Oppenheimer. ""This is a stab in the back of Abbas and the moderate people in the Palestinian Authority. Instead of strengthening the Palestinian Authority versus Hamas, Israel is showing its harder side and actually in a unilateral move: expand settlement activity and destroy the chance for re-negotiation with the Palestinian Authority.'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a staunch advocate for expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, land that Israel captured during the Six-Day War in 1967. Israel often has drawn condemnation, though, for its settlement expansion, which most countries consider illegal under international law. About 550,000 Israelis live among 2.4 million Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied east Jerusalem.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/765400730187018/?type=3,2014-08-31 16:10:58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The inflammatory statement was published in the government-endorsed daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun. coinciding with the yearly war drills being staged by the U.S. and South Korea.

""Merciless preemptive strike is the legitimate and best option of the revolutionary armed forces of North Korea against the nuclear war maniacs,"" the statement read.

North Korea perceives the military exercises off the southern part of the peninsula are part of a plan to launch a nuclear strike on the north. ""This is little short of declaring a nuclear war against North Korea,"" the statement said.

""The U.S. imperialists and south Korean warmongers are watching for a chance to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on North Korea at any cost. Under this condition North Korea should settle accounts with them.""

While describing the annual military drills as defensive, said the Rodong Sinmun statement, the two countries are ""making it a fait accompli to ignite a nuclear war despite the sincere efforts of North Korea for peace on the Korean peninsula. This is the shameless and brigandish sophism.""

""They would be well advised to stop acting rashly and think twice if they do not want to realize in miserable death and scream that North Korea does does what it is determined once,"" the statement concluded. 

Separately the Korean Central News Agency has taken aim at South Korea and it's part in the annual military exercises. ""The situation on the Korean peninsula and the inter-Korean relations are being driven into the worst phase as now entirely due to the sycophantic and treacherous acts of the south Korean puppet forces getting hell-bent on the moves for confrontation with the DPRK in league with foreign forces,"" a statement from the agency said.

The official government news agency has blasted the south's foreign minister, referring to him as a ""puppet minister,"" and a traitor.

""Yun Pyong Se, puppet minister of Foreign Affairs of south Korea, is behaving recklessly, forgetful of his wretched position,"" the news agency said. Since he took office as minister of Foreign Affairs, he has slandered North Korea, directing the focus of diplomacy to escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen.""

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was also singled out by North Korea's news agency which described him as a ""wolf donning the mask of sheep.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/760601254000299/?type=3,2014-08-21 03:04:20,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_760493234011101,"SAN FRANCISCO, Ca - The Israeli ship ZIM Peraeus, held at bay by protesters at the Port of Oakland for four days, has finally been unloaded.

Curiously however it has not ventured out beyond the Golden Gate Bridge, it remains anchored in the bay.

As the number of demonstrators began to thin out by Tuesday, after thousands had assembled on Saturday, police involvement, which earlier involved more than 100 officers, began to be wound down. With very few protesters and police in attendance the ship arrived at the port at 7pm Tuesday night, however there was no space available at the nominated terminal operator's leased space and the ship had to wait for another vessel to move before  a berth became available. By about 9pm the ship was in situ and by 10pm  dockworkers from the International Longshore Warehouse Union (ILWU) had begun to unload the ship's cargo. This process continued through the early hours of Wednesday morning, and was concluded by 4am. The ship was cut loose some hours later at 8.45am.

The ZIM Peraeus, owned by the giant Israeli shipping company, Zim Integrated Shipping Service Limited, which in turn is one-third owned by the Israeli government linked-Israel Corporation, had arrived at Oakland with its cargo on Saturday. A major demonstration at the port including the establishment of a picket line by protesters led to dockworkers refusing to unload the ship.

We reported previously the protesters had enlisted the support of the International Longshore Warehouse Union (ILWU), which famously blockaded ships from South Africa during the apartheid era, had been enlisted by the protesters. This was not the case as we clarified on Wednesday.

""The union had not taken a position on the events in Gaza,"" the communications director of the ILWU told Big  News Network. ""It is a common misconception. Simply and importantly it was a problem involving safety,"" he said. 

Pointing out there was a large demonstration and a heavy police presence it was concluded by members it was not a safe situation and they declined to report for work and stood by, Big News Network was told.

""No position had been taken on the Gaza situation, locally or internationally,"" the union's communications director told us. ""In fact there was no attempt to do so, and as we are a very democratic organisation, it would be an easy thing to do,"" he added.

Although not mentioned by the union official, a situation involving demonstrators and police in a similar situation occurred in 2003 in which a number of union members were shot with rubber bullets by police, which was probably a major factor in their reluctance to become involved.

Supporters of the boycott of the ship were jubilant Wednesday at having disrupted the unloading of the ship. ""For four days straight the San Francisco Bay Area community blocked the Israeli ZIM ship from unloading,"" a statement on the website of the Bay Area activist group Arab Resource  Organizing Center said. The statement goes on to ""salute"" members of the ILWU for their support, however as confirmed to us this is erroneous. The site does however attribute the organisation of the protest to a number of organisations:

Many of these groups are believed to be mobilising for an annual weapons convention to be held in Oakland next month which will involve a number of Israeli companies.

Mean time The Jewish Press, the largest daily Jewish newspaper in the United States, has lambasted the boycott at Oakland. ""Unless Oakland port find a solution to their protester problem, there is a good chance that ZIM will find safer ports to do business with, and other concerned cargo firms will follow,"" the outlet said in a comment on their website. ""That certainly won't be good for Oakland's economy or investment in the port, but that may also be one of the protesters' goals.""

109808052412959_760044984055926,"A four day-blockade of an Israeli cargo ship off Oakland, in California, is continuing.

Thousands of people from the San Francisco Bay Area protesting the Israeli army's offensive in Gaza have stopped the ship from docking at the Port of Oakland since Saturday.

The protesters enlisted the support of the dockworkers from the International Longshore Warehouse Union (ILWU), who famously blockaded ships from South Africa during the apartheid era.

""We really want to take the conversation beyond the massacre in Gaza, and to the whole Zionist project in Israel and what it is being imposed on Palestinians because we know this is cyclical,"" Reem Assil, an organizer with the Bay Area's Arab Resource and Organizing Center (AROC) said Tuesday.

""It's not just about the military offensive in Gaza. That sparked an international outrage, but we know this is nothing new. The ceasefire is still up in the air, and we want to make sure to use this point in our history to make sure this never happens again. Part of doing that is to isolate Israel."" 

The 964 foot long ship, Piraeus, is owned by the giant Israeli shipping company, Zim Integrated Shipping Service Limited, which operates 89 vessels, and has 450 offices and representatives in 135 countries around the world. Headquartered in Haifa, Israel, and established since 1945, the group until recently was owned by the Israeli government through its investment fund, Israel Corporation, a company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Israel Corporation recently agreed to a restructuring involving the shipping line's creditors and bondholders which left it with a 32% shareholding.

The Israeli consulate in San Francisco stressed the ship was only 32% percent owned by Israel and said the action ""will only hurt innocent American workers and the city of Oakland.""

The campaign ""Block the Boat for Gaza"" is expected to be repeated up and down the Californian coast, right up to Vancouver and taking in ports in Seattle and Tacoma, organizers say.

""Today we declare a historic victory for Palestine as Oakland held down the longest ever blockade of an Israeli ship,"" a statement on the AROC website is saying. ""Not only did we block the boat, but we also showed the world that the racist exclusionary state of Apartheid Israel has no place on our port, and will soon find that it has no place on any port on the West Coast.""

Rank and file workers from around the globe led the fight against apartheid in South Africa. Playing a major part were the ILWU dockworkers who consistently refused to load cargo ships from or to South Africa, in the face of police and court action. Nelson Mandela when he visited Oakland in 1990, just after being released from jail made a speech at at the Oakland Coliseum in which he heaped praise on the members of ILWU Local 10. ""The ILWU established themselves as the front line of the anti-apartheid movement in the Bay Area,"" he said.

Such were the ties, Local 10 president-elect Melvin Mackay represented the union at Mandela's funeral in South Africa in December.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/760044984055926/?type=3,2014-08-19 22:14:38,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_755161284544296,"TEL AVIV, Israel - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cited a Royal Air Force (RAF) bombing in World War II which claimed the lives of scores of children, as justification for the soaring death toll of civilians in Gaza. In an interview on Fox News, he pointed to a bombing in Copenhagen n 1944 in responding to questions about civilian casualties in the current conflict in Gaza..

Fox presenter Sean Hannity in asking about civilian casualties spoke of Winston Churchill. ""Well, I don't want to speak about Churchill...,"" Mr Netanyahu responded. Hannity was still speaking at this time, "" In other words, has modern warfare changed?"" he asked. 
 
""Well, I think we don't use carpet bombing. And we don't use deliberate targeting of a single civilian. We're targeting military targets, and sometimes, civilians are accidentally killed,"" the Israeli prime minister replied
 
""You talk about World War II, I'll give you another example of World War II. In 1944, the Royal Air Force, the British air force, goes out to bomb the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen. Perfectly legitimate target, except the British pilots miss, and instead of hitting the Gestapo headquarters, they hit a children's hospital nearby, and I think some 87 children are horribly killed.""
 
""That's not a war crime,"" continued Mr Netanyahu. ""That's a legitimate act of war against a legitimate target that has incidental and unintended casualties.""

While civilian casualties do occur in wars, particularly when warplanes are dropping bombs, and artillery fire is being launched from land and sea on densely populated areas, isomer would consider it is a far cry to justify nearly two thousand casualties in 2014 by comparing wartime conditions of 1944, some seventy years ago - when warplanes, the weaponry they were equipped with, their technology, navigational and targeting tools were primitive by comparison to what is in use today. For example it took 3 squadrons of six Mosquitos, plus 2 Mosquitos to film the raid, and twenty eight Mustangs as escorts (a total of 40 planes), to do what it would take a single F-16 to do today. 

Mr Netanyahu is correct in saying the plan was to bomb the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen. The date however was not 1944, it was 21 March 1945. He also erred on the fact that the Gestapo headquarters were 'missed.' They were destroyed. RAF records show the first wave of bombers hit their target. One of the planes was flying so low however it clipped an upright on a bridge and crashed into a French boarding school, setting it on fire and killing 86 children and eighteen adults including nuns. Certainly a horrific tragedy, and as the Israeli prime minister inferred many of the children would have been burnt to death. What followed was that the next wave of warplanes seeing the fire assumed that was the target, and some of them too bombed the school (not a children's hospital as understood by Mr Netanyahu). The school was 1.5 kilometres away from the Gestapo headquarters. 

There are a number of other inconsistencies in applying a World War II tragedy to the thousands of air strikes, and artillery attacks on Gaza, which have claimed the lives of nearly 2,000 people. The Copenhagen attack took several weeks to plan. ""Two large scale models, one representing the city, and the other the Gestapo building, were used to brief the pilots in every detail, trees, lake and houses, were pointed out on these models which took 340 man hours to construct,"" the RAF records show. For the Israel Defense Forces to have so carefully planned each of the thousands of air strikes in the same way in the current conflict would have taken decades of planning.

There is another key difference in this incident. It was the Danish Resistance that requested the RAF bomb the Gestapo headquarters. There was a purge underway of the Resistance and dozens of their leaders had been arrested. There was a fear that if allowed to continue, the Danish Resistance would be wiped out. In a further touch of irony, the Germans were holding 26 of the Resistance members as prisoners in the Gestapo headquarters as ""human shields.""

The German situation contrasts with that in Gaza, where the Israel Defense Forces embarked on a purge on what Hamas would describe as the Resistance and its leaders, with some hundreds of them detained after arrests in the West Bank, which preceded the current conflict. The other point is that whilst the Danish Resistance requested the RAF bomb the Gestapo headquarters, in Gaza the IDF is bombing the Resistance.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/755161284544296/?type=3,2014-08-10 02:45:48,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0

Since July 8, when this war began, more than 1,600 Palestinian and 65 Israeli lives have been sacrificed. Many in the world are heartbroken in the powerless certainty that more will die, that more are being killed every hour.

This tragedy results from the deliberate obstruction of a promising move toward peace in the region, when a reconciliation agreement among the Palestinian factions was announced in April. This was a major concession by Hamas, in opening Gaza to joint control under a technocratic government that did not include any Hamas members. The new government also pledged to adopt the three basic principles demanded by the Middle East Quartet comprised of the United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and Russia: nonviolence, recognition of Israel, and adherence to past agreements. Tragically, Israel rejected this opportunity for peace and has succeeded in preventing the new government's deployment in Gaza.

Two factors are necessary to make Palestinian unity possible. First, there must be at least a partial lifting of the 7-year-old sanctions and blockade that isolate the 1.8 million people in Gaza. There must also be an opportunity for the teachers, police, and welfare and health workers on the Hamas payroll to be paid. These necessary requirements for a human standard of living continue to be denied. Instead, Israel blocked Qatar's offer to provide funds to pay civil servants' salaries, and access to and from Gaza has been further tightened by Egypt and Israel.

There is no humane or legal justification for the way the Israeli Defense Forces are conducting this war. Israeli bombs, missiles, and artillery have pulverized large parts of Gaza, including thousands of homes, schools, and hospitals. More than 250,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinian noncombatants have been killed. Much of Gaza has lost access to water and electricity completely. This is a humanitarian catastrophe.

There is never an excuse for deliberate attacks on civilians in conflict. These are war crimes.

There is never an excuse for deliberate attacks on civilians in conflict. These are war crimes. This is true for both sides. Hamas's indiscriminate targeting of Israeli civilians is equally unacceptable. However, three Israeli civilians have been killed by Palestinian rockets, while an overwhelming majority of the more than 1,800 Palestinians killed have been civilians, including including around 400 children. The need for international judicial proceedings to investigate and end these violations of international law should be taken very seriously.

The U.N. Security Council should focus on what can be done to limit the potential use of force by both sides. It should vote for a resolution recognizing the inhumane conditions in Gaza and mandate an end to the siege. That resolution could also acknowledge the need for international monitors who can report on movements into and out of Gaza as well as cease-fire violations. It should then enshrine strict measures to prevent the smuggling of weapons into Gaza. Early discussions have already taken place. The Elders, an international group of elder statesmen of which we are a part, hope these discussions will continue and reach fruition.

At the Palestinians' request, the Swiss government is considering convening an international conference of the signatory states of the Geneva Conventions, which enshrine the humanitarian laws of warfare. This could pressure Israel and Hamas into observing their duties under international law to protect civilian populations. We sincerely hope all states -- especially those in the West, with the greatest power -- attend and live up to their obligations to uphold the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs the treatment of populations in occupied territory.

Unity between Fatah and Hamas is currently stronger than it has been for many years. As Elders, we believe this is one of the most encouraging developments in recent years and welcome it warmly. This presents an opportunity for the Palestinian Authority to reassume control over Gaza -- an essential first step towards Israel and Egypt lifting the blockade.

The Palestinian Authority cannot manage the task of administering Gaza on its own. It will need the prompt return of the EU Border Assistance Mission, an international effort to help monitor border crossings that was launched in 2005 and suspended in 2007. EU High Representative Catherine Ashton has already offered to reinstate the program, covering not only Rafah but all of Gaza's crossings. Egypt and Israel would, in turn, cooperate with international monitors to be deployed in Gaza and along its borders, backed by a U.N. Security Council mandate to protect civilian populations. A valuable precedent for trust-building between Egypt and Israel is the international peacekeeping force operating in the Sinai, mandated by the peace treaty signed by the two countries in 1979.

The international community's initial goal should be the full restoration of the free movement of people and goods to and from Gaza through Israel, Egypt, and the sea. Concurrently, the United States and EU should recognize that Hamas is not just a military but also a political force. Hamas cannot be wished away, nor will it cooperate in its own demise. Only by recognizing its legitimacy as a political actor -- one that represents a substantial portion of the Palestinian people -- can the West begin to provide the right incentives for Hamas to lay down its weapons. Ever since the internationally monitored 2006 elections that brought Hamas to power in Palestine, the West's approach has manifestly contributed to the opposite result.

Ultimately, however, lasting peace depends on the creation of a Palestinian state next to Israel.

Leaders in Israel, Palestine, and the world's major powers should believe that policy changes are within reach that would move Israelis and Palestinians closer to a day when the skies over the Holy Land can forever fall silent.

109808052412959_752867711440320,"Israel needs supporters around the world to save it from itself.

The best thing that its boosters can do now is to abandon myopic support of the nation, its government and its dangerous prime minister.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urgently needs to be reminded that international diplomatic, political and public support for Israel is not unconditional. Every day in Gaza, every death in Gaza increases the prospect that Israel's great fear of ""de-legitimisation"" by the international community will be realised.

If Israel is indeed facing an existential threat, then Netanyahu bears the lion's share of blame. For years he has held all the cards in the stand-off between Israelis and Palestinians and failed to use them for his nation's long-term benefit. He has allowed events to deteriorate so disastrously that Israel's Gaza adventure will inevitably diminish his nation's international standing still further.

Netanyahu has taken his nation down a path of confrontation from which it will be hard to return. He has provided Israel's enemies with more ammunition to attack the nation than any other Prime Minister since Menachem Begin launched the misbegotten invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and trashed his reputation as a Nobel peace prize recipient.

Since he took the reins in 2009, Netanyahu has fulfilled the worst fears of Israelis and friends abroad who believed in the prospect of a peaceful settlement with the Palestinians  the only path by which Israel can survive and prosper.

Hand-in-hand with rejectionist politicians, an aggressive settler movement and those who believe in an expansionist Israel, Netanyahu has determinedly blocked Palestinian aspirations for nationhood  the very same aspirations that the Jewish diaspora fulfilled in 1948. Jewish settlements in occupied territories and the ""security wall"" are merely physical manifestations of wide-ranging policies that undermine any prospect of an equitable settlement under Netanyahu.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have become increasingly despairing while those in the Gaza Strip have become more angry and outraged at their imprisonment. Of course there is a surge in hatred, of course there is a turning to more extreme forms of resistance.

At the same time a succession of international opinion polls has revealed increasing public frustration with Israeli policies. There is declining support for the nation even in the United States.

This view is not new but it is growing.  It began as far back as the Lebanon misadventure when Israel's claim to be a ""plucky little state amongst a sea of enemies"" first slipped. It had become an aggressor. Its complicity in the massacre of Palestinians in two refugee camps under Defence Minister, Ariel Sharon (later to become Prime Minister), merely hastened the fall from grace. Its brutal attempts to suppress the Palestinian uprising, the intifada, in 1987 accelerated the trend.

It took a much more far-sighted and able man than Netanyahu to reclaim some of that lost status.

Confronted yet again by a disaster in the battle for international opinion, then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was eventually forced by the intifada to negotiate with ""terrorist"" Yasser Arafat's PLO.  Rabin brought his nation closer to peace than any other Israeli politician and might well have succeeded had he not been assassinated by a right-wing Israeli fanatic opposed to the peace process.

Rabin, a military commander and hero, told me once that every war inevitably ended with opponents talking to each other. This was on the same occasion on which he kicked me out of his office for being impertinent.

Now, as Israel's international reputation takes a renewed hammering, Netanyahu needs to recognise that the other ""terrorist"" organisation, Hamas, also reflects legitimate Palestinian aspirations. Israel encouraged the growth of Hamas in the 1980s so it could divide and undermine Arafat's secular PLO  an irony lost on most today. That policy rebounded badly when Hamas won democratic elections in Gaza in 2006 and unsurprisingly proceeded to impose Islamist social mores on its constituents. Its public position was aggressively anti-Israeli but, while reporting from there, it was made clear to me by Hamas leaders that under the right circumstances the public and private postures could be very different  as is always the case in international disputes.

But Netanyahu and his predecessor, Ariel Sharon failed to heed the lessons that Rabin learnt in the 80s.

Their policies of increasing the stranglehold on Gazans in their prison and refusing to deal in any way with their elected government, while tightening the fist of occupation on West Bank and East Jerusalem and leaving no hope for peace have led directly to the latest series of catastrophes.

No one needs to condone the kidnap and murder of three young Israeli settlers  arguably the most immediate trigger for a series of events that led to the battle in Gaza  nor for Hamas rockets being fired indiscriminately into civilian areas of Israel. But these actions are easily understood as an outgrowth of frustration, despair and anger brought about by the policies of Netanyahu's government.

Gaza itself is now isolated from the outside world by Israel and by an antagonistic new regime in Egypt. It leaves Hamas little choice but to continue the battle since the only long-term ceasefire (proposed by Egypt and the US and accepted by Israel) would spell total capitulation. Israel went on to reject a second proposal.

Israel will naturally win the Battle of Gaza. Indeed, it can hardly be described as a battle at all since it is so one-sided. The death toll on both sides makes that abundantly clear.

The Israeli military annual budget of some $US14 billion is supplemented by a US contribution of $US3 billion a year, plus a further $US235 million for the Iron Dome anti-rocket system Israel deploys to render Hamas' comparatively puny rockets ineffective.

Faced with such overwhelming military firepower and by such political intransigence, Hamas will continue to fight in the only way it can for as long as it can  from amidst the chaos of a devastated city in one of the most densely crowded places on earth. Some of its attacks will inevitably be launched from heavily populated areas of Gaza. Just about everywhere is densely packed while to ""come out and fight in the open""  as Israel seems to be daring the resistance to do  is a ludicrous invitation to suicide in the face of such overwhelming and sophisticated force.  Armies hate urban warfare where overwhelming force becomes vulnerable to guerilla tactics.

In government, Hamas has proved itself incompetent and aggressive. But it is not, as Netanyahu charges, built in the mould of the extreme Islamist movement in Iraq and Syria, ISIS. It could be brought to the table. It has already agreed to a unity government with the secular PLO  a moved blocked by Israel.

The great sadness is that Netanyahu does not appear to be the man for this pivotal moment.

Israel needs someone with enough stature and vision to relaunch the nation on a course that Yitzhak Rabin set when he declared ""We who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you today, in a loud and a clear voice: Enough of blood and tears. Enough!""

109808052412959_752411651485926,"I remember when I attended a three-day workshop on international law and human rights by the ICRC in Gaza, one of the attendees asked the trainer: ""What do I do to be qualified to obtain those human rights?"" The trainer replied without much thought: ""Nothing. You should be a human, that's all"".

The question now is, what am I supposed to do/be to be qualified as a human? As far as I can tell, I live like normal humans do. I love, I hate, I cry, I laugh, I make mistakes, I learn, I dream, I hurt, I get hurt, I love pizza, I watched Titanic 6 times, I have a crush on Bradly Cooper, I get sick, I sometimes tell lame jokes to which only I laugh and last time I checked myself in the mirror I very much looked human.

 The only difference is that an occupying nation came from nowhere to claim exclusive ownership of my land on which an endless chain of my ancestors lived, and they started to ethnically cleanse my people.

My only sin is that I stood up and fought for my lost land and for everything that is dear to me.

The world accused me of terrorism just because I refused to be killed like an animal. But, even an animal will fight for its life.

I obeyed the US and went to elections; I voted for a party which met my expectations. But then I was punished for practicing the very democracy they taught me. I didn't realize that the modern definition of democracy is to elect a party approved by the US, not a party that the majority of voters want.

As a result, I was put under severe blockade and was subject to systematic starvation, locked in a tiny patch of land isolated from the rest of the world for years.

I finished my university degree in that period, studying for my finals by candle light and writing entire research papers by hand. I often spent the long school days without having enough money to buy food because my father, an engineer, had nothing to build with.

Within four strenuous years I graduated with big dreams. Unfortunately, they were bigger than my reality.

I remained jobless despite the huge potential I have.

I stood up and fought for what I perceived as my basic rights but what the whole world calls terrorism. My Gaza that has been exhausted by poverty and isolation was also subject to three deadly wars within less than a decade by the Israeli occupation whose forces are armed to the teeth with weapons of mass destruction, paid for by US tax payers.

And the world again blames me for fighting back with my very humble and often-laughed-at, hand-made weapons.

Tens of my people are being killed on a daily basis and I'm watching my childhood and youth wasted in pain and utter misery and the world is still labeling me a terrorist.

I am a terrorist because I fight for my basic rights which everyone else is taking for granted without shedding a single drop of blood and without being dehumanised.

Twenty-seven days of my short life were robbed from what are supposed to be the most beautiful years of my life. I spent them watching my loved ones getting killed because they were not human enough in the eyes of the world and I will spend many more years recovering from the war trauma instead of building my career.

If I don't survive this war, I would like the world to know that I have never seen a rocket nor stored any in my house.

Rest assured that I was not used as a human shield!

As I am writing this article, my mother told my father that we are out of cooking gas, knowing that we have been out of water and power for days now.

I still have not figured out what crime I have committed to endure this kind of wretchedness. I wonder what being human feels like.

109808052412959_752094648184293,"Arab states have entered into a secret pact to support Israel in its offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hinted the Arab states want Israel to defeat Hamas. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Jordan and Egypt have been silent as the death toll in Gaza has soared above 1,800, and injuries have approached 10,000.

Massive destruction has accompanied the casualties, which now exceed any of previous Israeli offensives. CNN commentators say requests for comments from Arab leaders and foreign ministers are being met with silence. None of the leaders of spokespeople for these countries that in the past have vented anger at Israeli actions, remain passively silent.

Now Israel has let the cat out of the bag. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been speaking in recent days of demilitarization of Gaza, and in the past two days has introduced an element of rehabilitation to coincide with demilitarization.  In statements in the past 24 hours he has been stressing Israel has the support of the United States and the European Union, and has thanked them implicitly for accepting their version of how the 72-hour ceasefire on Saturday broke down.

However for the first time in a statement made Sunday, Mr Netanyahu implied he has the backing of the Arab states, indicating their support may come as a surprise to others, but not to Israel.

""We are enlisting the international community to support this goal of linking the rehabilitation and development of Gaza to its demilitarization but no less important – this may surprise many, but not us – is the unique link which has been forged with the states of the region,"" the Israeli prime minister said.  ""This as well is a very important asset for the state of Israel. With the cessation of the fighting and the conclusion of the campaign, this will open new possibilities for us.""

Only Qatar is not in the fold and this was made clear by the Israeli premier, when he accused Doha of complicity with Hamas in what he considered 'deceiving' the UN and the U.S. over the aborted ceasefire.

""At this time it is clear what is happening here. Hamas wants the residents of Gaza to suffer and be hurt and thinks that the world will blame Israel for their suffering. There are many people in the world who understand exactly what Hamas is, the same organization that, together with Qatar, assured US Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon regarding a ceasefire. It misled both of them,"" he said.

Mr Netanyahu was effusive of President Obama and John Kerry's siding with Israel over the ceasefire violation, putting a positive light on what is being perceived as a strained relationship between the United States and Israel.

""I welcome the clear and sharp statements by US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Kerry, who placed the direct responsibility for violating the ceasefire on Hamas, and for President Obama's remarks last night regarding Israel's right to defend itself against rockets and tunnels,"" the Israeli prime minister said. ""Similar voices have been heard from other important leaders around the world.""

Arab leaders however remained silent publicly. News media outlets in the Gulf states too have toned down coverage of the current conflict in relation to past wars.

With the help of the eavesdropping, Der Spiegel reports, Israeli leaders were better able to understand Kerry's plans for his efforts during the negotiations and prepare for them. At times, the material collected even served to help Israel attack the US diplomat.
 
The author of the profile is Holger Stark, one of the magazine's senior writers and Germany's ""Journalist of the Year"" in 2013. Stark exposed the American eavesdropping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone  which led to a severe crisis in the relations between the two allies.
 
Stark is the current Washington, D.C. bureau chief for Der Spiegel.
 
According to the profile which will be published in Monday's paper, at the height of US-led nine-month period of negotiations Kerry was making daily phone calls to his colleagues in the Middle East.
 
When he was in the United States, most of the calls were placed from his office or  as would happen often due to the time difference  from his home in Georgetown. Both locations have secure phone lines.
 
But during Kerry's numerous flights his plane was not equipped with an encrypted phone line and the US diplomat made calls using a regular satellite phone which Israeli intelligence  according to Der Spiegel  managed to intercept.
 
According to the report, Israel was one of two countries which eavesdropped on the phone calls but the profile of Kerry does not name the second country.
 
Since Kerry was running the US State Department during these flights  and not only the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians  many of the recorded calls involved other international officials, including Russian and Chinese leaders.
 
Der Spiegel notes that the transcripts of the conversations were not kept within the Israeli intelligence community and were passed on to the political establishment, which employed them for its own purposes. Israel and the US refused to respond to Der Spiegel on the matter.

109808052412959_749023668491391,"You've got to hand it to Israeli spinners like Mark Regev. They are masters of PR. In fact, as the Independent's Patrick Cockburn revealed over the weekend, ""the playbook they are using is a professional, well-researched and confidential study on how to influence the media and public opinion in America and Europe"".

Let's be clear: I'm no fan of Hamas, a brutal and anti-Semitic group which has been accused by Amnesty International and other NGOs of human rights abuses against the people of Gaza and of war crimes against the people of Israel. Firing rockets into civilian areas isn't justified under international law, even if it is framed as part of a (legitimate) struggle against foreign military occupation.

Having said that, however, in recent days I've been debating supporters of Israel's latest assault on Gaza on radio and on Twitter and I've been astonished not just by the sheer number of fact-free claims made by those supporters, but also by their confidence, slickness and sheer message discipline. According to the pro-Israel, pro-IDF crowd, Hamas is to blame for everything.

This, of course, is utter nonsense. To quote the late US senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan: ""You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.""

So, in a Moynihanian spirit, here are fact-filled, evidence-based rebuttals to the 11 main myths, half-truths and self-serving 'talking points' that are repeatedly pushed by various Israeli spokespersons, both on the airwaves and on social media:

1) The Gaza Strip isn't occupied by Israel

Boston Globe: ""Israeli-imposed buffer zones.. now absorb nearly 14 percent of Gaza's total land and at least 48 percent of total arable land. Similarly, the sea buffer zone covers 85 percent of the maritime area promised to Palestinians in the Oslo Accords, reducing 20 nautical miles to three."" Human Rights Watch: ""Israel also continues to control the population registry for residents of the Gaza Strip, years after it withdrew its ground forces and settlements there."" B'Tselem, 2013: ""Israel continues to maintain exclusive control of Gaza's airspace and the territorial waters, just as it has since it occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967.""

2) Israel wants a ceasefire but Hamas doesn't

Al Jazeera: ""Meshaal said Hamas wants the 'aggression to stop tomorrow, today, or even this minute. But [Israel must] lift the blockade with guarantees and not as a promise for future negotiations'. He added 'we will not shut the door in the face of any humanitarian ceasefire backed by a real aid programme'."" Jerusalem Post: ""One day after an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire accepted by Israel, but rejected by Hamas, fell through, the terrorist organization proposed a 10-year end to hostilities in return for its conditions being met by Israel, Channel 2 reported Wednesday.. Hamas's conditions were the release of re-arrested Palestinian prisoners who were let go in the Schalit deal, the opening of Gaza-Israel border crossings in order to allow citizens and goods to pass through, and international supervision of the Gazan seaport in place of the current Israeli blockade."" BBC: ""Israel's security cabinet has rejected a week-long Gaza ceasefire proposal put forward by US Secretary of State John Kerry 'as it stands'.""

3) Israel, unlike Hamas, doesn't deliberately target civilians

The Guardian: ""It was there that the second [Israeli] shell hit the beach, those firing apparently adjusting their fire to target the fleeing survivors. As it exploded, journalists standing by the terrace wall shouted: 'They are only children.'"" UN high commissioner for human rights Navi Pillay: ""A number of incidents, along with the high number of civilian deaths, belies the [Israeli] claim that all necessary precautions are being taken to protect civilian lives."" United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, 2009: ""The tactics used by the Israeli armed forces in the Gaza offensive are consistent with previous practices, most recently during the Lebanon war in 2006. A concept known as the Dahiya doctrine emerged then, involving the application of disproportionate force and the causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to civilian populations. The Mission concludes from a review of the facts on the ground that it.. appears to have been precisely what was put into practice.""

4) Only Hamas is guilty of war crimes, not Israel

Human Rights Watch: ""Israeli forces may also have knowingly or recklessly attacked people who were clearly civilians, such as young boys, and civilian structures, including a hospital - laws-of-war violations that are indicative of war crimes."" Amnesty International: ""Deliberately attacking a civilian home is a war crime, and the overwhelming scale of destruction of civilian homes, in some cases with entire families inside them, points to a distressing pattern of repeated violations of the laws of war.""

5) Hamas use the civilians of Gaza as 'human shields'

Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor: ""I saw no evidence during my week in Gaza of Israel's accusation that Hamas uses Palestinians as human shields."" The Guardian: ""In the past week, the Guardian has seen large numbers of people fleeing different neighbourhoods.. and no evidence that Hamas had compelled them to stay."" The Independent: ""Some Gazans have admitted that they were afraid of criticizing Hamas, but none have said they had been forced by the organisation to stay in places of danger and become unwilling human-shields."" Reuters, 2013: ""A United Nations human rights body accused Israeli forces on Thursday of mistreating Palestinian children, including by torturing those in custody and using others as human shields.""

6) This current Gaza conflict began with Hamas rocket fire on 30 June 2014

Times of Israel: ""Hamas operatives were behind a large volley of rockets which slammed into Israel Monday morning, the first time in years the Islamist group has directly challenged the Jewish state, according to Israeli defense officials.. The security sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, assessed that Hamas had probably launched the barrage in revenge for an Israeli airstrike several hours earlier which killed one person and injured three more.. Hamas hasn't fired rockets into Israel since Operation Pillar of Defense ended in November 2012."" The Nation: ""During ten days of Operation Brother's Keeper in the West Bank [before the start of the Gaza conflict], Israel arrested approximately 800 Palestinians without charge or trial, killed nine civilians and raided nearly 1,300 residential, commercial and public buildings. Its military operation targeted Hamas members released during the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange in 2011.""

7) Hamas has never stopped firing rockets into Israel

Jewish Daily Forward: ""Hamas hadn't fired a single rocket since [2012 Gaza conflict], and had largely suppressed fire by smaller jihadi groups. Rocket firings, averaging 240 per month in 2007, dropped to five per month in 2013."" International Crisis Group: ""Fewer rockets were fired from Gaza in 2013 than in any year since 2001, and nearly all those that were fired between the November 2012 ceasefire and the current crisis were launched by groups other than Hamas; the Israeli security establishment testified to the aggressive anti-rocket efforts made by the new police force Hamas established specifically for that purpose.. As Israel (and Egypt) rolled back the 2012 understandings - some of which were implemented spottily at best - so too did Hamas roll back its anti rocket efforts.""

8) Hamas provoked Israel by kidnapping and killing three Israeli teenagers

Jewish Daily Forward: ""The [Israeli] government had known almost from the beginning that the boys were dead. It maintained the fiction that it hoped to find them alive as a pretext to dismantle Hamas' West Bank operations.. Nor was that the only fib. It was clear from the beginning that the kidnappers weren't acting on orders from Hamas leadership in Gaza or Damascus. Hamas' Hebron branch -- more a crime family than a clandestine organization -- had a history of acting without the leaders' knowledge, sometimes against their interests."" BBC correspondent Jon Donnison: ""Israeli police MickeyRosenfeld tells me men who killed 3 Israeli teens def lone cell, hamas affiliated but not operating under leadership.. Seems to contradict the line from Netanyahu government.""

9) Hamas rule, not Israel's blockade, is to blame for the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip

US State Department cable: ""Israeli officials have confirmed to Embassy officials on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy functioning at the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis.. Israeli officials have confirmed.. on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse without quite pushing it over the edge."" The Guardian: ""The Israeli military made precise calculations of Gaza's daily calorie needs to avoid malnutrition during a blockade imposed on the Palestinian territory between 2007 and mid-2010, according to files the defence ministry released on Wednesday under a court order.. The Israeli advocacy group Gisha.. waged a long court battle to release the document. Its members say Israel calculated the calorie needs for Gaza's population so as to restrict the quantity of food it allowed in.""

10) The Israeli government, unlike Hamas, wants a two-state solution

Times of Israel: ""[Netanyahu] made explicitly clear that he could never, ever, countenance a fully sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank.. Amid the current conflict, he elaborated, 'I think the Israeli people understand now what I always say: that there cannot be a situation, under any agreement, in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the River Jordan.'""

11) All serious analysts agree it was Hamas, and not Israel, that started this current conflict

Nathan Thrall, senior Mid East analyst at the International Crisis Group, writing in the New York Times: ""The current escalation in Gaza is a direct result of the choice by Israel and the West to obstruct the implementation of the April 2014 Palestinian reconciliation agreement."" Henry Siegman, former national director, American Jewish Congress, writing for Politico: ""Israel's assault on Gaza.. was not triggered by Hamas' rockets directed at Israel but by Israel's determination to bring down the Palestinian unity government that was formed in early June, even though that government was committed to honoring all of the conditions imposed by the international community for recognition of its legitimacy.""

109808052412959_747498605310564,"MELBOURNE, Australia - James Packer and Crown Resorts this week pledged to contribute $200 million to a philanthropic fund to be established. Gretel, James Packer's sister, will have a major role in overseeing the fund to be known as the National Philanthropic Fund.

""Philanthropy has always been a part of our family life, sometimes private, sometimes public, but always there,"" Gretel Packer said this week, referring to the significant contribution to various causes made by the parents of the Packer siblings, Kerry and Ros Packer.

The indigenous community, already receiving major attention from both James Packer and Crown, will be a significant beneficiary of the new fund, as will be the arts.

Although overseas on business, James Packer had a number of personal friends and business associates attend the launch of the fund at Crown Resort Melbourne on Tuesday.

The corporate arm of Packer's empire will contribute through the Crown Resorts Foundation, which is already contributing funds and resources to the arts, community welfare, education, health care and research, and the environment.

Packer's personal contribution will be through his family's foundation, the Packer Family Foundation Board, which is chaired by his sister Gretel.

""I am delighted to launch the National Philanthropic Fund,"" James Packer said in a statement earlier this week. ""This exciting collaboration between Crown Resorts and our family creates a platform from which to contribute towards strengthening communities in Australia and developing our artistic future.""

Packer paid tribute to his sister, who he described as the driving force behind the initiative. ""Today's announcement commits us to another decade of financial support for organisations which work tirelessly to deliver services, assistance and opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. I would like to
congratulate and thank my sister Gretel for being the driving force behind the establishment of this Fund,""  he said.

The Packer family last century forged a multi-billion dollar media empire, the cornerstone being the Nine Network. In latter years James Packer has used the family fortune to develop a potential mecca of resorts centered around entertainment, gaming and retail.  Crown Resorts, which is majority-owned by the Packers has major resort casino interests in Melbourne and Perth, has been awarded a
casino license for Sydney, and is involved in a joint venture applying for a casino license in Brisbane. The young tycoon is also forging interests in Japan and Sri Lanka, although the prize in the empire would undoubtedly be his interests in Macau.

Packer ventured into online businesses long before they became fashionable and was ahead of the game when he negotiated what in hindsight was a masterstroke in his disposal of the family's interest in Nine. Dealt a severe blow and a lesson in debt management in 2008/9 as a result of the GFC, Packer recovered quickly and looks set to take his family's fortune to the next stage and beyond. This week he set a good example for other well-heeled Australians in demonstrating a will to give back to the community.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/747498605310564/?type=3,2014-07-26 00:14:40,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_746691422057949,"TEL AVIV, Israel - Scores of Palestinians were taken into custody on Wednesday, after apparently giving themselves up. Of 150 Palestinians arrested, eighty of them were subsequently released. The remaining 70 were reportedly members of Hamas, and were handed over to Shin Bet and the Israeli army's intelligence unit for interrogation.

Israel's Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz subsequently either took or obtained a photo of the Palestinian prisoners after they had been stripped to their underpants and ordered into a kneeling position.

The minister then posted the photo on Facebook.

The International Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations around the world have taken to task parties in the past who have published photos of prisoners of war.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously slammed Iraq in the early days of the March 2003 invasion when five captured U.S. soldiers were videotaped and shown on Iraqi television. 

""The Geneva Conventions indicate that it's not permitted to photograph and embarrass or humiliate prisoners of war,"" Rumsfeld said at the time.

Rumsfeld and others based their remarks  on Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention which says, ""Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. …Prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.""

Previously, seven years ago, on July 17, 2007, at Congonhas-Sao Paulo Airport, TAM Airlines Flight 3054, an Airbus A320, crashed after landing too fast and missing the end of the runway causing it to crash into a warehouse. 199 people died in the crash.

Earlier again, 18 years ago, on July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800 exploded in mid-air and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, in New York, just twelve minutes after departing JFK International Airport. All 230 people on board the aircraft were killed.

Ukraine too has been the scene of a number of high profile airline crashes, beginning on May 18 1972 when Aeroflot Flight 1491, an Antonov An-10, experienced an in-flight structural problem as it approached Ukraine's Kharkov Airport. All 122 passengers and crew on board were killed.

On May 3 1985 Aeroflot Flight 8381, a Tupolev Tu-134, collided with a Soviet Air Force Antonov An-26. The two aircraft both crashed near Zolochev, Ukraine. All 94 on board the two aircraft died.

On August 22 2006 Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise Flight 612, a Tupolev Tu-154, crashed near Donetsk, Ukraine. All 170 people on board were killed.

On July 17 2014 the latest disaster occurred with the crash of MH17 which killed 298 people.

Another weird coincidence is with the 7 and 17 numbers, in which the Malaysia Airlines flight that crashed on Thursday was a Boeing 777 with the registration number 9M-MRD, which ironically had its first flight 17 years ago on July 17, 1997. And to touch it off the flight name was MH17.

And the biggest irony of all is that of all the planes in the air at the time of Thursday's crash/downing, of all the thousands of flights in transit, the plane targeted had to be a Malaysia Airlines plane. The odds of that happening after the disappearance of MH370 in March would probably have been a million to one.

The deliberate downing of a civilian airliner is not a usual occurrence but it has happened, and believe it or not it has happened in Ukraine - thirteen years ago.

In 2001, the Ukrainian military accidentally shot down a Russian civilian plane when they were carrying our a training exercise on the Crimean Peninsula, which has since been taken over by Russia earlier this year, the cause of the current crisis in Ukraine.

The United States which is closing in on Russia for its support to the Russian rebels, which may have led to the rebels having the capability of downing the Malaysia Airlines flight, itself downed an Iranian civilian plane in 1988. The Iran Air Airbus A300, flying over Iran's territorial waters on its regular route from Tehran to Dubai was hit by a surface-to-air missile from the USS Vincennes, a guided missile cruiser, that destroyed the plane, killing all 290 on board. [Under a 1996 agreement at the International Court of Justice, the U.S. agreed to pay Iran $61.8 million].",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/743678372359254/?type=3,2014-07-18 19:20:32,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_743149699078788,"KIEV/KUALA LUMPUR - A Malaysian Airlines flight has crashed in Ukraine near the Russian border, with all 80 passengers and fifteen crew members on board feared to have been killed. Malaysian Prime Minister Mohd Najib Tun Razak in a press conference late early Friday morning confirmed the Ukraine authorities believe the aircraft was shot down.

""A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, started descending 50km before entering Russian airspace, and was subsequently found burning on the ground in Ukrainian territory,"" an Interfax news agency aviation source reported earlier.

The plane disappeared on Thursday night from the radar at 10,000 metres and then crashed near the city of Shakhtarsk in conflict-hit Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian law enforcement authorities.

An advisor to Ukrainian Interior Minister Anton Herashchenko wrote on his Facebook that ""280 passengers and 15 crew members have been killed.""

The UN Security Council has called an emergency session for Friday to discuss the crisis. UN political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman was expected to brief the council, diplomats said.

US President Barack Obama spoke on the telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin soon after news about the crash was received. A White House spokesman said Obama had asked to be kept updated on the developments and told his officials to be in touch with their Ukraine counterparts.

The Malaysian prime minister at his briefing said he too had spoken to Obama, and the pair had agreed an international team should investigate the downing of the aircraft, and the team should have full access to the crash site.

A group of emergency services personnel, including a disaster, search and rescue team is on the way to the crash scene from Malaysia.

""MAS has lost contact with MH17 from Amsterdam. The last known position was over Ukraine airspace,"" Malaysia Airlines tweeted.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said the plane could have been shot down, but the Ukrainian Armed Forces had nothing to do with it.

""We do not exclude that the plane was shot down and confirm that the Ukraine Armed Forces did not fire at any targets in the sky,"" Poroshenko said in a statement posted on the president's website.

Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk said the government has formed a special investigative commission for the incident.

The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office said that law enforcement authorities could not access the crash site for investigation, as it is controlled by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR).

Andrei Purgin, first deputy prime minister of the DPR, said the first militia units had reached the crash site and found many children dead.

There were reports saying that the plane was shot down by the eastern Ukrainian militants, which was immediately denied by the DPR leadership.

""The plane was shot down by the Ukrainian side. We simply do not have such air defence systems, our MANPADs (man portaable air defence systems) have a firing range of only 3,000 to 4,000 metres, while passenger jets fly at a much higher altitude,"" Xinhua cited Interfax as quoting DPR officials.

The militants said they did not rule out that the plane could have been brought down by Ukrainian servicemen.

BBC online carried a tweet by Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammed Najib following the incident stating: ""I am shocked by reports that a Malaysia Airlines plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation.""

This is the second major tragedy for Malaysia Airlines this year after flight MH370 with 227 passengers on board went missing on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing March 8 and has still not been traced.

""This is a tragic day in which has already been a tragic year for Malaysia,"" the Malaysian prime minister said early Friday at the press briefing. ""There were many people, passengers and crew, of all nationalities. Today we are all united in grief.""

""Ukraine authorities believe the plane was shot down,"" Mohammed Najib said.

A number of international airlines including Lufthansa, Emirates, British Airways and Turkish Airlines have announced they will no longer fly over Ukrainian air space.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/743149699078788/?type=3,2014-07-17 16:48:48,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_742888449104913,"GAZA CITY - An Israeli attack killed at least four children at a Gaza Beach on Wednesday. A group of children and young adults appeared to be deliberately targeted in a strike that followed about 40 seconds after an initial blast, which witnesses said had killed the four children.

Hospital officials identified the children as Ahed, 10, Zakariya, 10, Mohammed, 11, and Ismael, 9, all members of the Bakri family. Witnesses said the boys were playing football on the beach next to the port when they were hit.

""It was clear that the fire was readjusted at them,"" said a journalist who saw the attack from one of a cluster of hotels next to the port where dozens of foreign reporters are staying.

The journalist said the wounds were inflicted by shrapnel. It was unclear whether the attack was carried out by an Israeli naval vessel, helicopter or drone.

The Israeli army said deaths appeared to be the ""tragic outcome"" of a strike targeting Hamas militants.

""Based on preliminary results the target of this strike was Hamas terrorist operatives,"" the military said in a statement. ""The reported civilian casualties from this strike are a tragic outcome.""

Pictures and video of the attack on the port showed the mangled bodies of children lying on the beach. One child had his legs blown off.

""He was cut in half,"" said Mohammed Abu Kweik, a driver for journalists staying at a nearby hotel, who ran to the scene shortly after the strikes.

He filmed the aftermath with his telephone and helped carry the wounded to ambulances.

It was unclear why Israel targeted the port, which has been struck several times in this and previous conflicts. Witnesses said they did not see militant activity such as rocket fire in the port area, where the family of the dead children worked as fishermen.

Witnesses said the second strike at the port wounded several others among the group of children and young adults as they fled for safety after the first attack.

Some of the wounded, who suffered from shrapnel wounds to the chest and other parts of the body, were given first aid by journalists at one of the hotels.

""We were in the hotel when we heard the first blast, so we ran outside. We saw a group of them running and then the second attack came,"" a journalist said.

Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday that Israeli attacks have been ""targeting apparent civilian structures and killing civilians in violation of the laws of war"".

""Israel's rhetoric is all about precision attacks but attacks with no military target and many civilian deaths can hardly be considered precise,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director at HRW. ""Recent documented cases in Gaza sadly fit Israel's long record of unlawful airstrikes with high civilian casualties.""

Elsewhere Wednesday Israeli war planes and naval vessels intensified attacks across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, targeting senior Hamas leaders.

The renewed violence came as Hamas formally rejected a ceasefire proposal that had been accepted by Israel to end the nine-day-old conflict that has left at least 220 Palestinians and one Israeli dead.

However, a senior Israeli official said later that, in reponse to a United Nations appeal, Israel would suspend hostilities for several hours on Thursday to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

Hamas fired dozens of rockets into Israel on Wednesday and vowed not to agree to a ceasefire until its demands were met. These include the easing of border closures and the release of former Hamas prisoners released by Israel in a 2011 prisoner exchange and rearrested by Israel last month in the West Bank.

A Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, said on Wednesday that Hamas felt ""alone in the field"" with little support from the Arab world.

He called on the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the rival Fatah faction in the West Bank, to support Hamas's refusal of an Egyptian ceasefire deal.

The Gaza interior ministry said Israeli warplanes carried out dozens of airstrikes on Wednesday, targeting 30 houses, including those of senior Hamas leaders Mahmoud Zahar, Jamila Shanti, Fathi Hamas and Ismail Ashkar.

Zahar was a key figure in Hamas's violent takeover of Gaza in 2007, while the other three were members of the Palestinian parliament elected in 2006. Many Hamas leaders have gone into hiding since the beginning of the Israeli offensive.

The Israeli army said 43 rockets struck Israel on Wednesday and 24 were intercepted.

Seven people were killed in three strikes in Gaza on Wednesday evening, raising the toll in nine days of violence to 220, emergency services said.

The deaths followed those of the Palestinian boys, all from the same family, who were hit while while playing on the beach in Gaza City.

Emergency services spokesman Ashraf Al Qedra said the seven Palestinians killed on Wednesday evening included four members of a family in Khan Yunis, among them two children, aged six and four.

Another strike in southern Khan Yunis killed two men, and a third strike in Gaza City killed a six-year-old boy.

Earlier, a man was killed in an airstrike on the Zeitun neighbourhood, east of Gaza City, which took place several hours after the army warned 100,000 residents to leave the area and the neighbouring district of Shejaiya, as well the northern town of Beit Lahiya, all near the border with Israel, by 8am on Wednesday.

The Israeli military said in its message that large numbers of rockets were launched from these areas and that Israel planned to bomb these locations.

However, most of Wednesday's deaths came in the south, with six people earlier killed in strikes on Khan Yunis and five killed in Rafah, which straddles the Egyptian border.

In Khan Yunis, four people from the Al Daqqa family were killed in two separate strikes, one of which killed a 65-year-old woman and a 10-year-old boy.

One of the victims in Khan Yunis was killed by tank fire.

In Rafah, five men were killed in four separate strikes, one of which hit a house in the city, Mr Al Qedra said.

More than 1,570 Palestinians have been wounded since Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip on July 8.

Egypt's truce proposal, announced on Monday night, had called for a halt in hostilities by Tuesday night to be followed by talks on the terms of a longer-term ceasefire, including easing Gaza's seven-year-old border blockade by Israel and Egypt.

Hamas views a significant easing of the Israeli blockade as key to its survival, but does not believe Egypt's current rulers  who deposed a Hamas-friendly government in Cairo last year  can be fair brokers.

After the truce effort collapsed, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Hamas would pay a high price.

109808052412959_740704285989996,"JERUSALEM/GAZA - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his government would not be deflected by criticism from abroad and vowed there would be more air strikes on Gaza as the death toll in Israeli airstrikes climbed to 151. More than 1,000 people have been injured.

Fifteen Palestinians were killed and 35 wounded in one Israel Air Force airstrike in the Tuffah neighborhood in Gaza City that hit a house and a mosque on Saturday night, Dr. Ashraf al-Qidra, the Gaza health ministry spokesman said Saturday. 

Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, called for an investigation into Israeli air strikes on Gaza on the grounds that the targeting of Palestinian homes which have resulted in a high death toll among civilians, particularly children, could violate international law.

As the Palestinian death toll from the four-day-old conflict mounted, Netanyahu declared the operation would continue.

""I will end it when our goals are realized. And the overriding goal is to restore the peace and quiet,"" Netanyahu said in response to a question about possible ceasefire efforts.

The UN Security Council on Saturday called for a de-escalation and ceasefire. ""No international pressure will prevent us from acting with all power,"" Netanyahu said. He claimed to have had ""good conversations"" with several world leaders in recent days, including US President Barack Obama and the leaders of Britain, France and Germany.

The Israeli military on Saturday claimed Israeli planes and drones had attacked 1,160 targets in Gaza so far this week, adding, ""there are still more to go"".

Netanyahu said Israel had struck Gaza with twice the force used during the last such offensive in 2012. He indicated there could be an incursion by ground troops as well. ""We are weighing all possibilities and preparing for all possibilities,"" he said.

According to the Gaza Health Ministry, by Saturday the Palestinian death toll stood at 151, with more than 1,000 injured. Many of the casualties were women, children and the elderly, the ministry said. Two disabled Palestinians, and 3 police officers were among Friday night's death toll. An attack on the home of Hamas leader Ismael Haniyeh's sister killed six people including Haniyeh's sister's two sons. 

There have been no Israeli fatalities.

More than five hundred and fifty Palestinian homes have been destroyed in the relentless air raids, and thousands of people have been displaced.

Hamas's armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, said on Friday it was beginning attacks on Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion international airport, warning airlines not to fly to it.

A Hamas rocket also caused the first serious Israeli casualty  one of eight people were hurt when a fuel tanker was hit at a service station in Ashdod, 20 miles north of Gaza.

Israel said it has shot down at least 110 incoming rockets with its ""Iron Dome"" defence system.

The incessant rocket fire exchange erupted after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in the West Bank and a Palestinian teenager was abducted and burned to death in an apparent reprisal attack last week.

The UN's top human rights official Navi Pillay said her office had received ""deeply disturbing reports that many of the civilian casualties, including children, occurred as a result of strikes on homes"" in Gaza. ""Such reports raise serious doubt about whether the Israeli strikes have been in accordance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law.""

She added that the ""indiscriminate firing of rockets from Gaza"" could also constitute a breach.

""Every alleged breach of international law must be promptly, independently, thoroughly and effectively investigated, with a view to ensuring justice and reparations for the victims,"" she said.

The White House said late Thursday that Barack Obama had phoned Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, to offer to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

""The United States remains prepared to facilitate a cessation of hostilities, including a return to the November 2012 ceasefire agreement,"" the White House said.

Middle East envoy Tony Blair said efforts were being made to reach a truce.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/740704285989996/?type=3,2014-07-12 16:23:03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_739760436084381,"TEL AVIV - As soon as the bombs started dropping on Gaza on Monday the phones were running hot - mainly from Tel Aviv to world leaders.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, was on the phone to world leaders telling them no country would allow rockets to be fired across their borders. Like clockwork, the official statements started coming. From the U.S., Canada, the UK, Europe and so on. ""We strongly condemn the continuing rocket fire inside of Israel and the deliberate targeting of civilians by terrorist organizations in Gaza,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.

""No country can accept rocket fire aimed at civilians and we support Israel's right to defend itself against these vicious attacks,"" he added.

Later in a press briefing State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said the U.S. supported Israel's right to defend itself.

""We condemn the firing of missiles at Israel and support Israel's right to defend itself,"" said Psaki.

During the briefing Psaki was asked whether Palestinians in Gaza have a right to defend themselves against Israeli aggression. 

Psaki was at odds to answer the question. Prior to being asked, the state department spokesperson repeatedly reiterated Israel's right to defend itself.

The U.S. agency also had difficulty answering a question on proportionality, as to whether Israel's response was proportionate to the firing of rockets, none of which have killed or seriously injured anyone (Two Israeli soldiers were lightly wounded by a rocket on Thursday).

Following is a transcript of the press briefing during the exchange on the questions of self defense and proportionality:

QUESTION: Remaining on the message theme, so you think that all Israel is doing is sending a strong deterrent message and that's all there is, and that remains within the accepted proportion or whatever, proportionality?

MS. PSAKI: I don't think that's what I stated, Said. There is obviously a range of circumstances on the ground right now, as you all know. There are the unfortunate recent deaths of the three teenagers. There are, there is the kidnapping and then the beating of the other teenager.

QUESTION: Right.

MS. PSAKI: There is violence and back-and-forth. I don't have to repeat for you. You know exactly what's happening on the ground.

QUESTION: I know. I understand and you don't have to repeat for me. But you feel that sort of the Israeli air raids, like maybe hundreds of them so far this day, are proportionate to the rockets?

MS. PSAKI: That's not  I wouldn't validate the accuracy of that number, but I would say, Said 

QUESTION: Okay. Well, the sorties  there are hundreds of sorties.

MS. PSAKI: I would say, Said, that I don't think any country would be expected to allow rockets to come in and threaten the lives and health and well-being of the citizens in their country, and Israel has the right to defend themselves.

QUESTION: Okay. Do you believe that the Palestinians in Gaza have the right to defend themselves?

MS. PSAKI: I think  I'm not sure what you're getting at, Said.

QUESTION: I am asking you: Do they have the right to defend themselves against Israeli aggression?

MS. PSAKI: What are you specifically referring to? Is there a specific event or a specific occurrence?

QUESTION: Do they have the right to respond to Israeli rocketing and bombing their homes, their houses, their areas, their schools?

MS. PSAKI: We're talking about attacks from a terrorist organization, Said. I don't think you're 

QUESTION: No, but there is also a population 

MS. PSAKI:  we're having a conversation about what's happening here.

QUESTION: I mean, you agree that there is a civilian population in Gaza that is also subject to 

MS. PSAKI: Certainly, and the threat, as I mentioned earlier, to civilian populations is of great concern to us. And that's one of the reasons why we're so focused on encouraging all sides to de-escalate.

QUESTION: Are you calling on someone like Egypt to intervene, perhaps, that can bring about some sort of quiet?

MS. PSAKI: We've, again, been in touch with countries from the region. I'm not going to get into any greater level of specificity.

QUESTION: Have you gotten a response from the Egyptians that they are willing to intervene or perhaps broker 

MS. PSAKI: I'll let countries speak for themselves. 

Secretary of State John Kerry has shown no interest in going to the Middle East. It is unlikely hostilities will end soon. ""No country can accept rocket fire aimed at civilians and we support completely Israel's right to defend itself against these vicious attacks,"" Kerry said Thursday.

UK Prime Minister David Cameron, in a telephone call to Netanyahu  told the Israeli prime minister ""Britain strongly condemns the appalling attacks being carried out by Hamas against Israeli civilians."" He ""reiterated the UK's staunch support for Israel in the face of such attacks.""

On Wednesday Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper spoke to Netanyahu.

""Prime Minister Netanyahu provided Prime Minister Harper with an update on the situation in Israel, including the steps Israel has taken to defend itself against the continued attacks by Hamas,"" a statement from the prime minister's office said.

""Prime Minister Harper reiterated Canada's steadfast support for Israel and its right to defend itself against these terror attacks. Both agreed that Hamas must end its targeted attacks on Israeli citizens,"" the statement said.

Ambassadors in Israel are being briefed on the ongoing offensive by Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman. 

""Israel had shown great restraint prior to this operation,"" Liberman wrote in a letter to foreign ministers in other countries on Wednesday. ""Our intention was to restore the calm without a major military operation. However, Israel's repeated efforts to achieve calm were met with increased rocket fire by what is becoming a Hamas terrorist state. Although we are not interested in escalation, we will do whatever is necessary to defend our citizens.""

Liberman said Hamas, which runs Gaza, has been labeled a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Japan and Egypt.

He accused Hamas of committing ""war crimes"" by ""deploying weapons and command centers in densely populated areas and operating from residential areas, thus turning Palestinian civilians into human shields, while deliberately targeting Israeli civilians.""

Liberman said Israel is ""operating with utmost care to avoid civilian casualties.""

""Israel is focusing on targeting Hamas and other terrorist organizations, their operatives and infrastructure, and giving repeated warnings to civilians to vacate areas they are about to target, using pinpoint technologies to hit only the targeted infrastructure,"" Liberman said.

As of Thursday 81 people had been killed, about half of them being civilians, including women and children.

850 bombing targets had been hit by Israeli warplanes and artillery fire, while 400 rockets had hit Israel. 

Nowhere in the narrative has there been given any attention to the Israeli assassinations, the raids, the arrests of 450 people, mostly Hamas members, and the deaths of several Palestinians during an aggressive search of the West Bank during the disappearance of the 3 Israeli teenagers, and the escalation of air raids over Gaza following the discovery of their bodies on June 30, which largely triggered the rocket attacks which had in-the-main been non-existent since the Egyptian brokered ceasefire in 2012.

Nowhere in the narrative is the fact that Gaza is an impoverished, prison-like enclave which has been subject to a blockade for 7 years, cut off from regular food and medical supplies and building materials. Air, sea and land access are controlled by Israel, which renders under international law the obligation of an occupying power to protect civilians. Nowhere in the narrative is the fact that Gaza's 1.5 million population, according to figures obtained from the United Nations, include some 850,000 children. 

Certainly Israel has the right to defend itself - but from an enclave that has no army, no air force, no navy, and its citizens have no bomb shelters, no air raid warning system, and no Iron Dome missile interceptors? And does it take massive air raids (850 bombing targets hit so far) and now an army threatening to swarm this tiny strip of land (41 kilometres (25 miles) long, and from 6 to 12 kilometres (3.7 to 7.5 miles) wide) that is so densely populated with children in particular? 

All because rockets have been fired for the first time in two years, none of which have killed anyone or caused any damage?",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/739760436084381/?type=3,2014-07-10 15:58:14,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_739234952803596,"TEL AVIV - In a dramatic escalation Israel has stormed the Gaza Strip with war planes hitting 550 targets since Monday. At least 53 Palestinians have been killed so far and more than 500 injured, Palestinian medical sources and Health Ministry officials told CNN.

Seven Palestinians, including 2 children under five, were killed and 25 wounded in an Israeli Air Force attack on Tuesday on a house in the Gaza Strip, Gaza medical and the Palestinian Interior Ministry told Ynet. 

Hafez Hamed, a commander in the armed wing of the Quds Brigades, was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beit Hanoun on Tuesday night, along with five members of his family.

Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida said Israel had violated the Egyptian-brokered truce that ended hostilities in 2012.

Israel is deliberately targeting civilians according to the head of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza, Raji Sourani. ""There is no safe haven in this place and Palestinian civilians are once again in the eye of the storm and are paying heavily. Israelis are trying to pressure militant groups through targeting civilians,"" he told the BBC.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, is targeting Hamas which he blames for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers. His concern follows the recent unity deal Hamas did with the Palestinian Authority.

Hamas, which denies any involvement in the kidnapping and murder of the Israeli teenagers, has been blamed from the outset by the Israeli prime minister. As soon as news filtered through of their disappearance he said he was holding Hamas responsible.

Over 450 people were arrested,  several were killed and dozens injured in aggressive searches, and raids, of the West Bank following the boys' disappearance on June 12. Following the discovery of the Israeli teens' bodies on June 30 Israel stepped up its bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip. Hamas responded with rocket fire but, according to Israeli sources, the rockets have caused no casualties or damage.

Gaza, which houses around 850,000 children among its 1.5 million population, has been under a blockade for seven years, limiting food, medical supplies and building equipment, and largely defenceless but for its sporadic, and largely useless rocket fire, and children throwing stones. On Wednesday, according to Israeli military sources, 72 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel. Fourteen were intercepted by the Iron Dome interception system, none of the others caused any casualties or damage.

Calling its current campaign ""Operation Protective Edge,"" Israeli army spokesman Brig.-Gen. Moti Almoz confirmed the deployment of Artillery Corps troops along the Gaza border, and the calling up of 40,000 reservists from the Central and Southern Commands.

""In the past weeks, residents of southern Israel were forced into an unbearable reality, a situation they haven't encountered in these scales since November 2012. In light of these circumstances, the IDF commenced operation 'Protective Edge'. We are determined to lay a significant blow on Hamas' terror capabilities and infrastructure, eliminate any threat on Israeli sovereignty emanating from the Gaza Strip and restore stability to the southern region. Terrorists perpetrating the aggression against Israel have a personal price to pay and will bear the consequences of their actions,"" Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli army spokesman said Tuesday.

Seven Palestinians were wounded in an Israeli army attack in Khan Younis. Two Palestinians were killed and several wounded in an Israel Air Force attack in Gaza City, reported Ynet.

The families of the murdered Israeli and Palestinian teenagers have condemned any form of revenge and vengeance. 

Palestinian-American Wadha Abukhdair, cousin of the murdered Palestinian boy Mohammed Abukhdair told Al Arabiya News on Sunday, ""Mohammad was an innocent boy, he was a 16-year-old boy, he was barely 90 pounds, he wouldn't hurt anyone."" 

""He had nothing to do with the kidnapping or death of those three Jewish teens. No one in his family had anything to do with it, no one in the vicinity had anything to do with it, and yet he's paid the price for their death,"" said Wadha.

""Their death caused his death here because the Israeli government and Netanyahu continuously spoke of vengeance, they incited their people to riot and into a frenzy and some of them wanted blood. This is what happened; a vigilante act against my cousin and he had nothing to do with it.""
 
The Palestinian teenager was allegedly beaten before being burnt to death in an apparent act of revenge for the kidnapping and murder of the Israeli teenagers. Israel has detained six people, 3 of them believed to be minors, in connection with the attack.

Prime Minister Netanyahu responded angrily to the Israeli teenagers murder. On Tuesday he met with military officials and gave directions to carry out a ""systematic, continuous, deep and strong operation in Gaza,"" saying the time had come to ""take off the gloves.""

""Hamas chose this escalation, and will pay a heavy price,"" he said, According to The Jerusalem Post he told the security establishment to ""be prepared to go all the way,"" including moving ground troops into Gaza. To that end, Netanyahu and Ya'alon approved the call-up of 40,000 reservists, the 'Post reported.

Netanyahu said he was not targeting Palestinian civilians, however the crammed-in population will hardly be protected from the onslaught. The Palestinians do not have the bomb shelters, warning sirens and Iron Dome missile interceptors that Israel has. Its 1.5 million population, of which more than half are children, are completely exposed to the warplanes, artillery fire, tanks , and troops that will ultimately storm their narrow strip of land.

Israel however is getting support for what is shaping up to be its biggest offensive in the Gaza Strip in two years. ""We strongly condemn the continuing rocket fire into Israel and the deliberate targeting of civilians by terrorist organizations in Gaza,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a Tuesday press briefing. ""No country can accept rocket fire aimed at civilians, and we certainly support Israel's right to defend itself against these attacks.""

Canada also issued a statement Tuesday saying Israel had the right to defend itself.  Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the rocket attacks by Hamas. These  ""prove that Hamas continues to target innocent civilians,"" he said, describing the rocket fire as ""belligerent acts of terrorism.""

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas took a different line, calling the Israeli offensive ""collective genocide.""

""This war is not against Hamas or another political party but it is against the Palestinian people,"" he said Wednesday. ""What do you call this crime? What is this crime known under international law? To kill entire families, is this collective punishment? No, this is called collective genocide.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/739234952803596/?type=3,2014-07-09 16:07:22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to the Laurel Leader-Call newspaper, Victoria Wilcher and her grandmother never visited the KFC location. Victoria Wilcher's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, claimed that an employee at a KFC in Jackson said the little girl's face was disturbing other customers and asked them to leave. Wilcher's face is badly scarred after three pit bulls attacked her. The story quickly went viral and the family reportedly took in more than $100,000 in donations online. KFC also pledged $30,000 toward Wilcher's medical bills. A third-party mediator was brought in to investigate the situation and an unnamed source claims that neither Wilcher nor her grandmother could be seen on surveillance tape from either of the KFC restaurants in Jackson. There is also no transaction that matches the order that Wilcher's grandmother described -- mashed potatoes and sweet tea. ""We have never ever, ever run off anyone, and we have seen some really, really sick people come to the restaurant from the hospital,"" the source said. ""We've had people come in who were shot in the face. We've had them with tubes and wire sticking out. We never have asked anyone to leave.. It just didn't happen."" Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, KFC will honor the commitment it made to assisting Wilcher with her medical bills. ""We continue to take this report seriously, and of course have great sympathy for Victoria and her family. Since we have so far not been able to verify the incident in our internal investigation, we have also hired a third-party consultant to conduct an independent investigation to help us resolve this matter,"" Jackson KFC franchise owner Kirk Hannon said in a statement to WJTV. ""We have always prided ourselves on respect for all people and we will continue to emphasize this to all our employees,"" Hannon continued. ""In addition, regardless of the outcome of the current investigation, KFC Corporation has committed $30,000 to assist with Victoria's medical bills. Along with the KFC Corporation, we are determined to get to the truth and address the situation appropriately.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/731303136930111/?type=3,2014-06-24 14:06:04,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The jury found Brooks not guilty of hacking voicemails, two counts of conspiracy to pay public officials and two counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. But News of the World editor Andy Coulson was found guilty for conspiring to hack phones and is awaiting a verdict on two other charges.

Brooks and Coulson were among seven defendants facing various charges including phone hacking and perverting the course of justice, with Coulson being the only one convicted.

The verdict comes after nearly a week of deliberations by the jury, in what has been a lengthy trial looking into the scandal involving Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Allegations of phone hacking surrounded the British tabloid, News of the World, since 2006 but came to the fore in 2011 when a private investigator hired by the tabloid intercepted voicemails of missing British teenager Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered.

Amid public backlash and a withdrawal of advertising, News International, run by Rebekah Brooks, announced the closure of the paper July 2011. The tabloid has also been accused of hacking the phones of families of British service personnel killed in action and the British royal family.Ananth Baliga",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/731293360264422/?type=3,2014-06-24 13:46:17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

SEOUL, South Korea - Two unmanned drones have crashed in South Korea in the last week, allegedly fired by North Korea, prompting security officials in Seoul to seek advanced surveillance and air defense.
Military experts say that the discoveries point to North Korea's aerial capabilities and raise questions about South Korea's air defense expertise.

According to South Korea's semi-official Yonhap news agency, a drone was found on Baengnyeong Island, located just south of the western maritime border, Monday.

The two Koreas had earlier exchanged artillery fire across the sea boundary during a live-fire drill by North Korea.
A similar drone was discovered in Paju, south of the demilitarized zone last Monday.

SANTIAGO, Chile A powerful 8.2 magnitude earthquake hit parts of Chile Tuesday night, leaving a trail of destruction amid small landslides, severe power cuts and leaving at least six people dead. 

The mighty quake also raised tsunami warnings that were later lifted for Chile's coastline.
The quake struck about 8:46 p.m. Tuesday, some 100 km northwest of Iquique, a port city in northern Chile, with a population of more than 200,000.

The US Geological Survey said it had a depth of around 24 kilometres. The government declared a state of emergency in the earthquake hit region with President Michelle Bachelet in a late-night address urging citizens to stay calm. ""Appropriate measures have been taken to protect their lives and their belongings. And the government will continue to work all the time that is necessary to confront this emergency and protect our citizens,"" the president said. 

""The fact is we will know the extent of the damage as time goes by and when we inspect the areas in the light of day The country has faced these first emergency hours very well."" The quake triggered small tsunamis after Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued several tsunami warnings. But the warnings were canceled by early Wednesday.

109808052412959_673830656010693,"When at least two passengers with stolen identities boarded Malaysia Airlines MH 370 flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, they were fortunate not to have been discovered and nabbed.

Technology and a database listing all passports stolen in the world are maintained by Interpol and are freely available to governments, airlines, hotels, and anyone dealing with global travellers.

The tragedy is virtually no one, but a handful of governments are taking advantage of the technology.

There has been a rising trend of people exploiting globalization to assume identities of law-abiding citizens so they can avoid detection when planning or committing crimes and terrorist attacks.

Samantha Lewthwaite, the so-called 'white widow' of a London July 2005 suicide bomber, is currently wanted internationally by Kenya for possession of explosives, after using a fraudulent identity document to travel abroad, obtain employment, sign leases and secure loans, all in the name of the unsuspecting person whose identity she assumed.

It is not known the purpose or even the identity of the two passengers, one with a stolen Italian passport, and the other with a stolen Austrian passport, who boarded the Malaysia Airlines flight. The fact they were travelling with stolen documents is only one factor in the puzzle of the missing airliner, and may in fact have nothing to do with the plane's disappearance.

Nonetheless it has exposed the enormity of the problem of identity theft. 

INTERPOL's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database currently contains 40 million records from 167 countries. Though it was searched more than 800 million times in 2013, with the United Arab Emirates alone making one in every eight searches as the third largest user, Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said not enough countries are making use of this critical global policing tool.
 
""The bad news is that, despite being incredibly cost effective and deployable to virtually anywhere in the world, only a handful of countries are systematically using SLTD to screen travellers,"" he said.
 
""The result is a major gap in our global security apparatus that is left vulnerable to exploitation by criminals and terrorists."" 
 
To identify criminals using fraudulent documents before they try to cross a border or board an airplane, INTERPOL has developed I-Checkit  an initiative which will allow private sector partners in the travel, hotel and banking industries to screen documents against the SLTD database when customers book a plane ticket, check into a hotel or open a bank account.
 
""Yet, we all know that today an even greater threat related to identity looms not from the person beside you in a plane, hotel or bank, but rather from someone unseen and unknown to you who could be halfway around the world,"" said the INTERPOL Chief, who was speaking at an international forum in Abu Dhabi last month.
 
In the future, Mr Noble said, 'more and more criminals will be connected and anonymous.'",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/673830656010693/?type=3,2014-03-08 15:59:45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
109808052412959_673829129344179,"Two passengers who boarded the missing Malaysia Airlines flight early on Saturday morning were not who they represented to be.

Foreign ministry officials in Italy and Austria have confirmed the nationals named as having being on board are in fact alive and well, and accounted for in their own countries.

A common denominator between the two is that both have recently had their passports stolen.

While nothing had been ruled out when the aircraft first disappeared over the South China Sea two hours after take-off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41am on Saturday, a major focal point for investigators is now the identity of the two passengers and whether the plane has been targeted as a terrorist attack. It should be stressed however that at this point there is no evidence the identity theft of any passengers are linked to the plane's disappearance.

Meantime late Saturday a Vietnamese search plane reported oil slicks several miles long have been seen about 90 miles south of Tho Chu Island. Vietnam's official news agency is reporting that it is believed the slicks are from the missing airliner.

239 passengers were on board the plane, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which was bound for Beijing.

Air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane at approximately 2:41am Malaysian time Saturday. Airline officials made it clear they had no clue as to the whereabouts of the plane or what had caused it to stop communicating. 

Fears were held the plane, a Boeing 777-200, had met with an instant, catastrophic event, which would have prevented the crew from getting off a distress call. 

A massive search involving maritime vessels and civil and military aircraft from Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, and Singapore swung into action early Saturday morning. Seven ships and 17 aircraft scoured parts of the South China Sea throughout Saturday. While the aircraft ceased searching when nightfall fell, the ships continued the search through the night. Planes were expected to be back in the air at first light Sunday.

Malaysia Airlines has stepped up its concern for families and friends of the 239 passengers and crew on board. ""We are dispatching all information as and when we receive it. The situation in Beijing is also being monitored closely. As many families of passengers are in China, we have deployed our ""Go Team"" to Beijing with a team of caregivers and volunteers to assist the family members of the passengers,"" the airline said in a statement in the early hours of Sunday morning.

""Immediate families of passengers are advised to gather at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Travel arrangements and expenses will be borne by Malaysia Airlines. Once, the whereabouts of the aircraft is determined, Malaysia Airlines will fly members of the family to the location.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/673829129344179/?type=3,2014-03-08 15:58:42,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
109808052412959_673828616010897,"A jet airliner with 239 people on board has gone missing over Asia.

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 which left Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41am Saturday was due to arrive in Beijing at 6:30am Saturday.

The 3,700 kilometre (2,300 mile) flight involving a Boeing 777-200 went missing two hours after take-off. Malaysia Airlines says it has lost contact with the aircraft and has ""no idea"" of its location. The plane disappeared without warning. There was no distress call or any hint of any concern with air traffic controllers along the route. When contact was lost the plane was flying over the South China Sea. A huge air and sea search is now underway to locate the missing plane.

The airline said it had tried to contact the plane through a variety of means but had been unsuccessful. After fifteen minutes of no contact the airline is required to alert aviation authorities which is what occurred.

Airline officials have confirmed that reports that the plane had landed at an airport in China are untrue. Malaysia's Operations Manager said Saturday the airline ""does not have a clue"" as to the plane's whereabouts.

The plane, around 12 years old and one of fifteen in Malaysia Airline's inventory, is carrying 227 passengers and twelve crew members. The airline says the passengers on board represent fourteen different nationalities. There were 152 Chinese plus one infant on board, 38 Malaysians, 12 Indonesians, 6 Australians, 3 French citizens, 3 from the United States plus one infant, 2 New Zealanders, 2 from Ukraine, 2 Canadians, 1 Russian, 1 Italian, 1 Taiwanese, 1 Dutch citizen and 1 Austrian. The captain of the flight is Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a Malaysian aged 53, who joined the airline in 1981 and has had 18,365 hours flying experience. The first officer, Fariq Ab.Hamid, also a Malaysian, aged 27, joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007 and has 2,763 flying hours experience.

""Malaysia Airlines is currently working with the authorities who have activated their Search and Rescue team to locate the aircraft,"" the airline said in a statement released early Saturday morning local time. 

""The focus of the airline is to work with the emergency responders and authorities and mobilize its full support,"" the statement added.

Anyone seeking information on family or friends on board the aircraft can telephone 603 7884 1234 for further information. Next-of-kin based in Kuala Lumpur can go to the Support Facility Building at KLIA's South Support Zone.

109808052412959_672431046150654,"News Corp newspapers in Australia have reignited their attack on former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

On Wednesday The Australian, Rupert Murdoch's flagship national newspaper, reported Rudd had flown to Russia in the wake of the crisis in Crimea. A digitally-altered imaged showed Rudd wearing a fur lined ""Ushanka"" Russian hat. Kevin Rudd has always said he's ""here to help,"" is the line News used to weld Rudd into some sort of mediation role in Russia. ""It is understood that diplomats suspect he may be trying to ""deal himself"" into the crisis as a self-appointed special envoy,"" says the article. 

An almost-full page story followed in Thursday's top-selling Daily Telegraph ridiculing the ex-PM's visit to Russia describing him as a ""self-appointed peace envoy"" in the Crimea crisis. It again uses the line ""here to help,"" notwithstanding it was not a Rudd quote, but a News Corp invention.

The crux of the story is that Rudd is in Russia as the Crimea story and the crisis in Ukraine is unfolding. 

""Mr Rudd is engaged in a Harvard Kennedy School Project on China's future role in the global order,"" a spokeswoman for the former prime minister's office said Wednesday. ""He is meeting with think tank officials in Europe including the UK and Russia on this and other broader foreign policy interests."" Rudd's office confirmed his trip to Russia was planned well before the crisis blew up in Ukraine.

Nonetheless Patrick Lion, a national political reporter based in the press gallery in Canberra has written the near-full page piece portraying Rudd as having inserted himself in the midst of the Ukraine crisis as some sort of a peace negotiator or an international mediator of world crises. The headline of Lyon's article is ""I'm Kiev-in and I'm here to help."" The story features five photographs with a smiling Kevin Rudd inserted in each of them, with arms around world despots in world trouble-spots North Korea, Syria and Zimbabwe. Another photo-shopped image is of a smiling Rudd with his arms around Joseph Stalin and Franklin Roosevelt in the company of Winston Churchill and others at the Yalta peace conference in 1945 embedded with the quote ""If only they had called Kiev-in to the Yalta peace conference in 1945 we may have avoided the Cold War."" 

The clearly-orchestrated attack on Rudd was supported with an editorial which makes the point that the U.S. has Dennis Rodman while Australia has Kevin Rudd. ""Welcome to the world of deluded diplomacy,"" says the editorial.

The piece says Rudd now sees himself as a ""supreme negotiator.""

""So it's off to Russia to solve the tricky dilemma of how to tone down President Vladimir Putin's sabre rattling and extract Russian troops from the Ukrainian-owned Crimean peninsula. Rudd is either suffering from an acute case of relevance deprivation, or he is making a play for the coveted Nobel Peace Prize. Probably both,"" says The Daily Telegraph article.

""Where was he when the Central African Republic imploded into civil war and mass killings? Certainly nowhere near Bangui where there isn't an Australian diplomatic official available to pick him up and take him to a non-existent Hilton.""

""Why wasn't Rudd hosting talks in Damascus when the evil al-Assad regime began systematically killing his own people?"" asks the Telegraph.

""Kevin Rudd has always been about Kevin Rudd. And now he is on the fast track to national embarrassment. Memo to Russia: You can keep him.""

The renewed attack on Rudd, follows a gap since the election result in September last year when Rudd's government was replaced by Tony Abbott's.

The election followed a relentless six year campaign by News Corporation which resulted in a number of hatchet jobs on various Labor leaders including Rudd, his successor and predecessor Julia Gillard, and a host of former ministers. The campaign would have unseated the Labor government in 2010 however a hung parliament resulted as Gillard managed to win a similar number of votes to Abbott. Newspoll kept track of the News Corp activity, and polls after each demolition job led to leadership challenges and bitter rows that eventually divided the Labor party and ultimately the electorate.

Since Rudd and associates have been driven from power the Abbott government has been battling to live up to the image News Corp painted. While Murdoch's army has been championing or protecting Abbott from an immense number of blunders and broken promises many say he has brought, the polls, including the News Corp partly-owned Newspoll, have pointed to a massive swing back to Labor, so much so that if an election was held now Abbott would be swept from office.

News Corporation apparently see a need to be back ridiculing and slamming current and former Labor leaders to get the polls back in Abbott's favour.

On Tuesday of this week The Australian, Murdoch's flagship national newspaper all-but-declared its new stance with a riveting attack on new Labor leader Bill Shorten.

""There are many reasons why at last year's federal election Labor recorded its lowest primary vote in more than 100 years,"" the editorial opened. ""Disunity, fiscal incompetence, weak leadership and poor processes loom large. With two-thirds of voters emphatically rejecting the ALP's style of governing over two terms, the message from the electorate should be obvious to the remnants of its Canberra delegation: don't make the policy mistakes of the Rudd-Gillard years. Yet six months after its heavy defeat, Labor is stuck in a dead zone, locked into failed positions and carrying the baggage of the lamentable Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard years.""

After a lecture on how the Labor opposition should be responding to the Abbott government, the editorial takes direct aim at the opposition leader. ""Mr Shorten is oddly wedded to Ms Gillard's failed workplace legacy, even though he was instrumental in removing her from the leadership. The Opposition Leader has proven himself weak in not demanding an apology from Stephen Conroy after the latter accused Lieutenant General Angus Campbell of participating in a political cover-up via his military role in combating people-smuggling. Mr Shorten also displayed poor judgment over a weekend trip to honour troops in Darwin. These missteps are avoidable for an able politician. But Mr Shorten is not looking anything like a modern Labor leader, one in touch with the concerns of voters or with the best reforming traditions of his proud party.""

Let the games begin.....again.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/672431046150654/?type=3,2014-03-05 19:50:57,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
109808052412959_672317052828720,"In the early days of the Syrian uprising-turned civil war three years ago, the writing on the wall of it becoming an intricate regional and international conflict was there for all to see. Despite their many differences, there are two common denominators that unite all the parties involved in the Syrian conflict. One is that they are all contributing, directly or otherwise, to the killing of Syrians with unmitigated impunity, savageness even. And, two, in the same breath, they all pose as defenders of the Syrian people. It is not a puzzle, but the nature of dirty conflicts. 

Yet all the 'defenders' of the Syrian people, with no exception, are now scarred. No media campaign, hearty speech or amount of money could alter this reality. The regime of Bashar al-Assad can make all sorts of claims, but there is no changing the fact that the Syrian army has killed thousands of innocent Syrian civilians. The same logic applies to the opposition and their allies, some hastily declaring 'Islamic states' and emirates on conquered territories. 

The Syrian people can never peacefully co-exist with the current power structure in Damascus, nor with those offering themselves as the alternative. 

Outside parties are equally culpable. Iran, Iraq, Turkey, various Lebanese forces, including Hezbollah, Russia, the EU, the US, and of course, Gulf countries, have done more than a fair share of damage. They often meet in whichever political forum they have concocted to save the Syrian people, yet somehow, their actions  selective and utterly self-involved  seem to achieve the opposite outcome. 

Where are the 'friends of Syria'  of all the parties above  as Syrian children continue to die from the cold in refugee camps within or outside the borders of Syria? Why are the refugees being treated with absolute neglect, if not revulsion in some Arab countries bordering Syria to the extent that some elect to flee back to the war inferno at home? 

Arab media oftentimes suppress reports of abuse of Syrian women in refugee camps based in countries to which the refugees fled for protection. Some are kidnapped and sold for prostitution; others are raped with no consequences. It is strange how sensitive some are regarding women's honor, yet nothing is done to bring their dishonoring to an end. 

As for the children, one can never overstate the horror of a child dying from cold, hunger or bullet wounds, without having a basic conception of who is inflicting such terror or why. The Syrian survivors among this generation will grow up very angry, and rightfully so. The consequences are likely to be as severe as the resultant from the anger that brewed following the US invasion of Iraq over a decade ago. Iraq is now caught in an endless fury.

For Palestinians, anger is compounded. There is the destruction of Syria, a country that despite its many deficiencies, once hosted the 'axis of resistance'  the last battle front for those standing up against Israeli militancy and US hegemony. Regardless of the justification behind their intervention, they have all been discredited. A young Syrian man told me about his cousin, who left Lebanon to fight in Syria and was killed by Hezbollah. ""Yes, I cried,"" he said. ""My brother urged me to 'have faith', but I don't see why crying is a sign of lacking faith."" One could have hardly imagined a scenario in which Hezbollah, once celebrated as the liberator of Arab land, be used in so miserable a context. The cards are getting more and more mixed up by the day, and, once more, all are tainted, and none are innocent. 

Then, there is the siege of Yarmouk, a large refugee camp for Palestinian refugees and working class Syrians located on the outskirts of Damascus. The hermetic siege will be remembered by historians along such infamous memories like that of Deir Yassin, Sabra and Shatilla, Jenin and Gaza. This time, Israel is hardly a direct factor in the starvation, killings and humiliation of tens of thousands of Palestinians undergoing one of the most suffocating sieges in the modern history of warfare. Yes, Yarmouk's residents became refugees because of Israel's ethnic cleaning of Palestinians in 1948, but there can be no justification to the current disgrace experienced at the hands of Arab armies and militias. 

Whenever a rumor goes around that a few bags of food have somehow made their way to the camp, thousands of people run around in complete desperation, begging for crumbs. Most of them go back empty handed, often greeted with gunfire. Scores have starved to death since the siege was imposed on Yarmouk last year. The Syrian government blames the rebels, the latter blame the government. Evidence emerging from the camp suggests they are both liable. 

""An old woman arrived as we finished distributing whatever aid we managed to bring into the camp,"" Laila, a Luxembourgian friend who bravely went to Syria along with some others told me. ""We had none left, but the woman kept on begging and talking about her grandchildren dying from hunger,"" she said as she fought her tears. ""Suddenly, one government soldier attacked her with so much brutality, beating her up over every part of her body. We were so shocked and terrified by the scene, we could do nothing as the skinny old woman wailed in pain."" 

Yet, not a single Arabic news channel or publication ever takes a break from championing the cause of Palestine, and, now Syria. Arab leaders oftentimes wear Palestinian traditional scarves (kuffiyas) as gestures of solidarity. They pay respect to the Palestinian flag at every opportunity, and once in a while, with much fanfare, announce a large financial contribution to build a mosque or a hospital that naturally carries their name. Official Syrian channels still speak of the looming battle to liberate Jerusalem. Yet, Arab fingerprints are all over much of the misery that has befallen Palestinians, whether in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria or elsewhere. 

Syrians need to remember the Palestinian experience that has lasted 65 years and counting, in that of ethnic cleansing and military occupation. With all the self-proclaimed 'liberators' that have come and gone, all the slogans, conferences, press statements, poetry, mass prayers, generous announcements of aid and all the rest, most Palestinians in the Middle East continue to live in squalid refugee camps. They are the subject of numerous books, articles and documentaries, yet few come to their rescue as they are forced to eat the few homeless dogs and cats in their refugee camps to survive. Yarmouk is a testament to that despondent legacy, which many continue to ignore, while continuously speaking of 'Arab brotherhood' and 'Arab solidarity'. 

Syrians need only to reflect on the collective Palestinian history of destitute to predict their own future if they don't take charge of their own destiny, independent from all the parties that declare undying love for Syria and its people.

Israa (not her real name) was arrested by US and Iraqi forces in 2010. She was tortured to the point of confessing to terrorist charges she didn't commit. According to HRW's ""No One is Safe"" - a 105-page report released last week  there are thousands of Iraqi women in jail being subjected to similar practices, held with no charges, beaten and raped.

In Israa's case, she received most degrading, but typical treatment. She was handcuffed, pushed down on her knees, and kicked in the face until her jaw broke. And when she refused to sign the confession, it was then that electric wires were attached to her handcuffs. 

Welcome to the 'liberated' Iraq, a budding 'democracy' which American officials rarely cease celebrating. There is no denial that the brutal policies of the Iraqi government under Nouri al-Maliki is a continuation of the same policies of the US military administration, which ruled over Iraq from 2003 until the departure of US troops in December 2011. 

It is as if the torturers have read from the same handbook. In fact, they did. 

The torture and degrading treatment of Iraqi prisoners  men and women  in Abu Ghraib prison was not an isolated incident carried out by a few 'bad apples.' Only the nave would buy into the 'bad apples' theory, and not because of the sheer horrendousness and frequency of the abuse. Since the Abu Ghraib revelations early in 2004, many such stories emerged, backed by damning evidence, not only throughout Iraq, but in Afghanistan as well. The crimes were not only committed by the Americans, but the British as well, followed by the Iraqis, who were chosen to continue with the mission of 'democratization.' 

""No One is Safe"" presented some of the most harrowing evidence of the abuse of women by Iraq's criminal 'justice system'. The phenomenon of kidnapping, torturing, raping and executing women is so widespread that it seems shocking even by the standards of the country's poor human rights record of the past. If such a reality were to exist in a different political context, the global outrage would have been so profound. Some in the 'liberal' western media, supposedly compelled by women's rights would have called for some measure of humanitarian intervention, war even. But in the case of today's Iraq, the HRW report is likely to receive bits of coverage where the issue is significantly deluded, and eventually forgotten. 

In fact, the discussion of the abuse of thousands of women  let alone tens of thousands of men  has already been discussed in a political vacuum. A buzzword that seems to emerge since the publication of the report is that the abuse confirms the 'weaknesses' of the Iraqi judicial system. The challenge then becomes the matter of strengthening a weak system, perhaps through channeling more money, constructing larger facilities, and providing better monitoring and training, likely carried out by US-led training of staff. 

Mostly absent are the voices of women's groups, intellectuals and feminists who seem to be constantly distressed by the traditional marriage practices in Yemen, for example, or the covering up of women's faces in Afghanistan. There is little, if any, uproar and outrage, when brown women suffer at the hands of western men and women, or their cronies, as is the situation in Iraq. 

If the HRW report remerged in complete isolation from an equally harrowing political context created by the US invasion of Iraq, one could grudgingly excuse the relative silence. But it isn't the case. The Abu Ghraib culture continues to be the very tactic by which Iraqis have been governed since March 2003. 

Years after the investigation of the Abu Ghraib abuses had begun, Major General Antonio Taguba, who had conducted the inquiry, revealed that there were more than 2,000 unpublished photos documenting further abuse. ""One picture shows an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee,"" reported the Telegraph newspaper on May 2009. 

Maj Gen Taguba had then supported Obama's decision not to publish the photos, not out of any moralistic reasoning, but simply because  ""the consequence would be to imperil our troops, the only protectors of our foreign policy, when we most need them, and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan."" Of course, the British, the builders of security in Afghanistan, wrote their own history of infamy through an abuse campaign that never ceased since they had set foot in Afghanistan. 

Considering the charged political atmosphere in Iraq, the latest reported abuses are of course placed in their own unique context. Most of the abused women are Sunni, and their freedom has been a major rallying cry for rebelling Sunni provinces in central and western Iraq. In Arab culture, dishonoring one through occupation and the robbing of one's land comes second to dishonoring women. The humiliation that millions of Iraqi Sunni feel cannot be explained by words, and militancy is an unsurprising response to the government's unrelenting policies of dehumanization, discrimination and violence. 

While post-US invasion Iraq was not a heaven for democracy and human rights, the 'new Iraq' has solidified a culture of impunity that holds nothing sacred. In fact, dishonoring entire societies has been a tactic in al-Maliki's dirty war. Many women were ""rounded up for alleged terrorist activities by male family members,"" reported The Associated Press, citing the HRW report. 

""Iraqi security forces and officials act as if brutally abusing women will make the country safer,"" said Joe Stork, deputy MENA director at HRW. It was the same logic that determined that through 'shock and awe' Iraqis could be forced into submission. 

Neither theory proved accurate. The war and rebellion in Iraq will continue as long as those holding the key to that massive Iraqi prison understand that human rights must be respected as a precondition to a lasting peace.

109808052412959_657103351016757,"Property portal www.realestate.com.au has had a stunning turnaround after being on the brink of bankruptcy in 2000.

Established in 1995, the portal was listed on the stock exchange in 1999 but by 2000 was haemorrhaging cash. It was then prominent property broker Johnathon McGrath, who remains a director today, took Lachlan Murdoch for a drink to see if he would rescue the company. Within a day a deal was done for News Corp to inject $2.25 million in cash and $8.5 million in contra advertising from its Australian newspapers, which in reality were rivals to the website. The mechanics of the deal, a watershed for both the fledgling portal, but also for News, was apparently Lachlan Murdoch who disregarded News executives concerns and phoned New York himself to get the go-ahead. The deal was done, with News Corp also underwriting  the site's bank debt. News Corp executives were sceptical of the deal, particularly as it was at a time when the .com bubble was unravelling, but Murdoch urged them to get on board.

Whilst www.realestate.com.au would take profits away from the company's newspaper classifieds advertising, the reality was if this site didn't, then somebody else's site would. In other words, Murdoch was reported to have said, ""If www.realestate.com.au doesn't eat our lunch, then someone else will.""

News Corp took a 44.2% stake in the company for its outlay, and took an option to increase its stake by a further 10 million shares. In 2005 the company made a full takeover bid, even taking out James Packer's 4.85% holding. Packer was later quoted as saying, ""With the benefit of hindsight, Lachlan got the better of me on that one.""

Fast-forward to this week, with the company re-flotated the-then $2 shares hit $44.95, an all-time record. With approximately 131.7 million shares on issue, the company's capitalisation hit $5.9 billion.

Lachlan Murdoch should take a bow. Not only did he save the company, but he took News Corp's $10.75 million investment to a value of $3.65 billion. (News Corp through subsidiary News Limited currently owns approximately 81 million shares or near-on 62% of REA Group, the re-named www.realestate.com.au).
 
REA Group, which also operates www.realcommercial.com.au, acquired software and website attico.it, an Italian real estate site in November, and last month picked up 1form.com, an Australian rental application storage site. The company also began beta testing of a portal for Chinese investors in Australian real estate, www.myfun.com, last month.

The company's Australian sites attract 22.5 million unique visitors per month.
 
This week REA reported a 37% increase in net profit to $70.7 million for the six months to December 31.

109808052412959_646551395405286,"Tens of thousands of American men and women who served for their country in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are now living on the streets.

Tens of thousands more are enrolled in programs aimed at keeping them off the streets.

While presidents, vice presidents, defense secretaries and military leaders line up one after the other for their lucrative book deals and speaking engagements, the men and women they praised so lavishly for their service now have nowhere to go.

While the United States spent trillions of dollars waging war in Iraq and Afghanistan, enriching companies like Halliburton by hundreds of billions of dollars, the veterans of those wars re being tossed peanuts.

At least the number of peanuts has been enlarged. The Veteran Affairs budget for dealing with ex soldiers has gone from $60 million to $300 million a year. Distributed amongst the huge volumes of soldiers covered in its various programs however, the funds are a mere drop in the ocean.

U.S.  military personnel who have returned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are  homeless in ""almost unimaginable numbers,"" says Gordon Duff, senior editor at  Veterans Today.

American  veterans are returning to the United States ""where our economy is in total  shambles, where we have massive unemployment in the non-veteran work force,"" he said in a phone interview late last month.

""Despite our  lowered unemployment figures, a large percentage of those are people that are no  longer even bothering to look for work because there is no work in the U.S.,"" he  added.

As revealed by the Department of Veterans Affairs on Thursday, nearly 48,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans were either homeless or in a federal program designed to keep them off the streets during 2013, almost triple the number in 2011. 

Advocates for the homeless say many of the estimated 2.5 million Americans who served in the two wars went into combat zones on multiple deployments, something many veterans of previous conflicts never had to endure, USA Today reported in an article published Friday.

""They're coming home to a bad economy. The country is different. Their families are different. They are different. Plus they are dealing with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and other issues around mental health,"" says Gregory Scott, president of New Directions For Veterans, a non-profit assistance group in Los Angeles.

""We don't know what the long-term impacts will be on the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans,"" John Driscoll, president and chief executive officer of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans was quoted as saying.

VA spokeswoman Victoria Dillon told USA Today writer Gregg Zoroya the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans struggling with homeless issues has grown because the department has expanded efforts to identify and assist them. The department has programs throughout all 50 states, working with community groups to target homeless veterans, and as a consequence, a more accurate picture of the number of these veterans is emerging.

A lack of affordable housing has contributed to veteran homelessness, the VA says.

This week, the department announced it will continue to fund, at a record annual level of $300 million, a program that places a priority on finding immediate shelter for veterans or helping those at risk of homelessness to keep their homes.

The program, said the USA article, began with $60 million in 2011 and grew to $300 million in 2013. The department recently announced it was locking in funding at $300 million for each of 2014 and 2015.

""Those who have served our nation should never find themselves on the streets, living without hope,"" VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said in announcing the funding.

The money is in the form of grants to more than 300 community groups that target homeless veterans or those at risk of becoming homeless. It provides a range of services to help veterans keep their homes, including mediation with property owners, assistance with rent and utilities, moving expenses, child care and transportation, the VA says.

Driscoll says consideration should be given to increasing the grants to $500 million annually because the ultimate extent of homelessness among veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars is unknown.

""We don't know what the need for services long-term is going to be,"" he says.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/646551395405286/?type=3,2014-01-18 12:47:30,1,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_643071842419908,"Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has died from complications associated with a massive stroke he suffered eight years ago. He was 85.

Israeli news reports say Sharon died Saturday at a hospital near Tel Aviv.

Sharon served as prime minister from 2001 until 2006, when a stroke left him hospitalized and in a coma.

A week ago, medical officials said his kidneys and other vital organs had begun to fail.

As a soldier, Sharon was known for his daring heroics on the battlefield in the decades following the creation of the State of Israel, most notably during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. In a brilliant tactical display, he led Israeli troops across the Suez Canal, cutting off Egypt's third army.

He was also known to many for being reckless and brutal. In 1982, he led an invasion of Lebanon that resulted in the massacre, by Lebanese militias, of hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut.

Dennis Ross, a former U.S. Middle East negotiator, says the military shaped Sharon.

""He certainly came to believe that the only way peace would be possible would be for Israeli strength to be respected."" he said.

As a politician, Sharon was also controversial. As a cabinet member, he promoted the establishment of Jewish settlements throughout the Palestinian territories.  

Palestinian scholar Shukri Abed says this won him further hatred among Arabs.  

""To say the least, not trusted, and probably hated by many of them, because of his strong positions, because he was an advocate of  building settlements,"" Abed said. ""He was the father of building settlements.""

As head of the opposition in 2000, Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount, or Haram al-Sharif, in Jerusalem sparked anger among the Palestinians and triggered the uprising known as the Second Intifada.  

He became prime minister in 2001.

His government suppressed the uprising within a few years, and began work on the security barrier that now separates Israelis from Palestinians.

While Sharon is remembered as a tough leader who spared no action to defend his people, he was also one who could take difficult steps.  

In 2005, he oversaw Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, pulling Israeli settlers and soldiers out of the enclave in the hopes of achieving peace with the Palestinians. 

""The relocation of the settlements will be in order to draw an efficient security line that will create a disengagement line between Israel and the Palestinians,"" Sharon said at the time.

He left the hawkish Likud party to form the centrist Kadima party which subsequently engaged in intense but unsuccessful peace talks with the Palestinians, aimed at establishing a separate Palestinian state.

In 2006, Sharon suffered a series of strokes and slipped into a coma. He was replaced by Ehud Olmert as prime minister.
    
In a vegetative state, the former prime minister spent the next few years at a hospital near Tel Aviv before being transferred to home care at his ranch in southern Israel.  

Sharon dedicated his life to building a strong Israel. His efforts to bring peace remain a work in progress.

Israel's current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said there is ""deep sorrow"" in the Jewish state over Sharon's death. Sharon says the former leader will live forever in the nation's heart.

Omri Ceren is a senior adviser at The Israel Project, a pro-Israel nonprofit group in Washington. He told VOA Sharon is a figure of ""overarching importance"" in Israel's history for his role in reshaping the country's civil and military sectors.

""Sharon was both a military hero - at times, arguably one of the country's greatest military heroes in the aftermath of particular wars - but also a political giant,"" Ceren said. ""He, in the military context, was thought to have been critical to winning - to literally, quite literally, winning - entire theaters during wars like the Yom Kippur War, the 1973 war. And politically, he quite literally redrew Israel's electoral map.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/643071842419908/?type=3,2014-01-11 11:26:50,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_624977690895990,"Former South African President Nelson Mandela is dead at the age of 95. Mandela, known to South Africans as Madiba, passed away at his Johannesburg home on Thursday. He had been ill for some time with a lung infection. Mandela became the country's first black president, after he was freed from apartheid prisons where he spent nearly three decades of his life. 

He was considered a terrorist by Britain and the United States for his opposition to the apartheid government. Surprisingly he was not removed from the U.S. terrorists list until July 2008. Each time he visited the United States, prior to then, a whole set of special arrangements and conditions had to be agreed to. 

""Fellow South Africans, our beloved Nelson Rohlihla Mandela, the founding president of our democratic nation, has departed,"" South African President Jacob Zuma said in a nationally televised address on Thursday night.

""Our people have lost a father. Although we knew this day was going to come, nothing can diminish our sense of a profound and enduring loss. His tireless struggle for freedom earned him the respect of the world. His humility, passion and humanity, earned him their love,"" he added.
  
Flags at government buildings throughout South Africa have been lowered to half-mast, while the organization of a state funeral has been set in motion. 
  
Mandela came from nowhere to take on South Africa's apartheid government. In the early days he supported armed resistance to the brutal regime, but was quick to promote reconciliation and forgiveness when apartheid began to crumble, and elections were held.

In 1993, a year before he was elected president, Mandela, in company with F.W. de Klerk, the white Afrikaner leader, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1994 he became South Africa's first black president. He was greeted around the world by kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers. He was as popular abroad as he was at home.

He worked tirelessly to break down racial discrimination, resentment, and prevent revenge against the country's former rulers.

He established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which investigated apartheid crimes. He served only one term insisting the job of president was for someone younger. He stepped down in 1999.

While he continued his work in retirement, advocating an end to AIDS and promoting South Africa's interests abroad, he gradually wound his hectic activities schedule down. In 2010 he attended a World Cup match at a stadium in Soweto where 90,000 fans gave him a thunderous ovation. It was his last public appearance.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/624977690895990/?type=3,2013-12-05 18:23:39,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_624445827615843,"On Tuesday afternoon Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott stepped in front of the cameras and reflected on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's reporting of the Indonesian phone tapping revelations. ""I think the ABC were guilty of poor judgment in broadcasting that material which was obviously difficult for Australia's national security and long-term best interests,"" he said.

It was an extraordinary comment for the prime minister to make about the editorial decisions of a public broadcaster independent of government interference and concerns. But perhaps not a surprising one. Abbott's words echoed those of his communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who has earlier labelled the ABC's co-operation with Guardian Australia over material about Australian intelligence targeting the mobile phones of the Indonesian president, his wife and their inner circle ""a shocking error of judgment"".

The ABC's managing director, Mark Scott, seemed forced to take to one of his own stations to defend the broadcaster from a barrage of criticism about its involvement in the story. ""I think in a sense there is some ideology behind some of the critics,"" he told ABC News 24.

Many would agree with him. On the same day Scott was fighting for ABC independence, and Abbott and Turnbull questioned the ABC's editorial judgment, in the Coalition party room critics were airing old grievances: that the public service broadcaster hurts commercial media players, has too many TV channels, costs far too much.

On Wednesday morning, the Liberal backbencher Cory Bernardi called for the ABC's online news service to be curtailed because it competed with Fairfax Media and News Corp. ""We could perhaps cut the ABC budget and allow the commercial media operators to compete more effectively,"" he told Radio National.

These are many of the arguments also made in the Australian, the News Corp national daily which has been mounting a sustained campaign to undermine the ABC. On Tuesday, among other things, it described Scott as being in a ""bromance"" with the Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger.

It is hardly news that politicians and commercial rivals find the public service broadcaster an irritant. It wouldn't be doing its job if they didn't. But despite Coalition promises not to cut the ABC's funding, the noise coming from News Corp and the Coalition government is unsettling those who believe in a stronger rather than weaker public broadcaster. 

The ABC's opponents are baying for blood. ""The case for a major review of public broadcasting is overwhelming and it will be surprising if the Abbott government does not announce one in its first term,"" wrote the Australian columnist Nick Cater this week. 

But what case? Is political reaction to a story going to be used as an excuse for overhauling the broadcaster? And what does that say for the future of independent reporting in this country? The ABC is not an arm of government; it is independent. It exists to serve the people of Australia and not the government of the day. 

The ABC is not just a news and current affairs department and a single TV station. It serves the community on every level, from emergency services to community information to reflecting and nurturing Australian culture. There are five radio networks including local stations which serve regional and rural areas and are a lifeline for isolated communities. It provides commercial-free programs for children and innovative dramas such as Redfern Now which challenge and confront.

The corporation has been a leader in catch-up TV, online news and podcasts, and mobile services. In a country dominated by one media corporation, a vital independent public broadcaster is essential for democracy. 

Inside the ABC there is consternation that the current barrage of criticism will be used as justification for paring the organisation back. Media commentators outside the corporation are wondering why members of the government are instructing the independent ABC on how or what to report.

""Is Malcolm Turnbull wanting the ABC to be the equivalent of Pravda, just a ministerial mouthpiece?"" asks the academic Jenna Price. ""Australians want a free, fair and frank broadcaster responsible to its citizens, not to its government. That's what protects us.""

The former ABC chairman Mark Armstrong eloquently explained the antipathy politicians feels towards the public broadcaster. ""Politicians are in the business of managing information to make themselves look good,"" he said. ""No commercial outlet is as turbulent, as investigative or as critical as the ABC. Why should the politicians feed the mouth that bites them? 

But first the prime minister – ""I think it's fair enough for people to question the judgment of the ABC"" – and now his communications minister have attacked the broadcaster, deflecting attention from the details of and government reaction to the Indonesia story on to the governance of their troublesome public broadcaster.

Turnbull's quote on Tuesday morning – ""I thought it was an error of judgment on their part to publish that material"" – reported in the Australian, is just the latest in a long line of anti-ABC stories from the Murdoch-owned paper.

Emboldened by obtaining a substantial package of payroll information, mistakenly released by the ABC in a shocking blunder, the paper has published more than a dozen news stories, editorials and columns on that subject alone. It is a juicy story, but coverage was overegged and drawn out interminably; the relatively low salaries of ABC presenters not compared to their commercial equivalent in any meaningful way.

The ABC's reporting on the Indonesian spy story with Guardian Australia has also been a favourite subject – along with a shopping list of sins. Little wonder Scott came out to publicly address his critics on Tuesday.

""We have come under concentrated attack from News Corp,"" he said. ""Some aspects seem quite obsessed by us and I think there are some who have an ideological opposition to public broadcasting. I think there are some who think they would make more money if the ABC wasn't what it is today.""

With those remarks Scott got to the heart of the issue. The newspaper is ideologically opposed to a public broadcaster. It believes the ABC is taxpayer-funded competition for an already stretched commercial media, and has expanded far beyond its original remit with ABC Online, digital channels, a 24-hour news channel and an overseas channel, Australia Network, which should – News Corp believes – rightly be run by Sky News.

As a media writer for the Australian for many years, I reported on the ABC. I was at times an annoyance to managing directors, including Mark Scott. I wrote about cuts to foreign bureaus and programming, the cost of outsourcing TV, staff redundancies and the exploits of one MD who was eventually to be sacked by the board, Jonathan Shier. But I never advocated that the ABC should be stripped of funding, reined in or prevented from reporting stories that may hurt the government.

Attacks from News Corp papers, in particular from the Australian, are now so frequent that there can be no pretence the paper is running anything but a campaign. Where anti-ABC material once might have been found on the comment pages, now it seems to be reported as news, despite some stories having little news value.

Monday, for example, saw the paper arguing the ABC should not be promoting Twitter and Facebook on its programs – even while the Australian's story featured the button for sharing on social-media platforms attached to every story.

The leaking of the salaries of the ABC's on-air talent and management has given the paper the ammunition it has been craving. Kerry O'Brien – the subject of a long-term vendetta from News Corp editors – was attacked for daring to be paid at all for his interview series with Paul Keating, after his salary was not disclosed because he left the corporation.

The Australian has been trying to find out how much O'Brien is paid for a very long time. His critics believe that he was overpaid because he only worked ""part time"" when he was hosting The 7.30 Report, which was national four nights a week only. It explains the glee behind the leaking of the ABC payroll. 

The payroll was the worst thing News Corp has been able to find on the ABC in its many years of trying. It came at the same time as the broadcaster decided to publish with Guardian Australia, creating a perfect storm. The same could be said for the government. This is opportunism at its most naked – two organisations ideologically opposed to the public broadcaster, manufacturing an opportunity to demand its overhaul.

109808052412959_624077094319383,"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Education Minister Christopher Pyne have betrayed the trust of the Australian electorate, The Sydney Morning Herald said in an editorial on Tuesday.

The daily newspaper was taking aim at the duo over their handling of educational reforms, or schools funding, put in place by the previous government. The Herald said Abbott and Pyne had betrayed the Australian electorate, ""on the Gonski reforms at every twist and turn.""

""Having been caught out once more, they have made yet another political backflip to limit the damage,"" the editorial said referring to the announcement on Monday that the government would in deed honour its election promise of matching Labor's funding commitments.

""Australians are not stupid."" said the Herald. ""They know the Gonski plan is a chance to ensure every child has an equal opportunity to reach his or her potential.""

The newspaper does however warn its readers to be cautious about what it describes as the government's ""political backflip.""

""There are no guarantees in the Abbott government's latest commitments. Much remains unknown. What's more, in its half-hearted reversion to a watered down and cut short Gonski-lite, the government has jettisoned most of the trust and goodwill of voters on education policy and far beyond,"" the newspaper's editorial said.

""The cynicism behind the government's betrayal could hardly be greater.""

""Voters can trust us in a way they could never trust old billion-dollar Bill [Shorten] over there,"" Abbott told Parliament on Monday. 

""Education is about the future of our children. It is not a political plaything. Yet for months Abbott has bobbed and weaved on Gonski to the extent that it is hard to know which of his comments to take seriously; which ones he expects voters to take ""absolutely as the gospel truth"" and which ones are just thought bubbles in ""the heat of verbal combat,"" said The Sydney Morning Herald.

""Abbott has said he does not believe the current school funding system is broken - in effect accepting its unfair skewing towards wealthier schools. Pyne has said Gonski is a 'con-ski'.""

""Each deliberately reversed their position to win over voters during the election campaign,"" said the Herald editorial. ""They promised that Labor and the Coalition were on a ""unity ticket"". They committed to match four years of Labor's six-year deals with NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.""

""When in government, the Coalition reverted to hype. Pyne claimed Labor had left Gonski as a shambles. He cut the commitment to one year and vowed to go back to the drawing board. He disrespected the Gonski panel and played down its research - it has even been erased from departmental websites. He applauded the discredited Howard-created model of school funding,"" reported the Herald.

""Pyne and Abbott claimed teacher quality and empowering principals were more important than money. This was a deliberate attempt to misrepresent Gonski, which in fact ties funding to performance benchmarks on those issues.""

Abbott expressed preference for a ""flatter"" funding model - code for less weighting based on need. He even tried to blame voters and the media for his broken promise: ""We are going to keep the promise that we made, not the promise that some people thought that we made, or the promise that some people might have liked us to make.""

As the public backlash grew, however, the government reverted to the four-year funding commitment - knowing full well that the vast majority of the Gonski benefits begin to take effect between years five and 10, said the Herald editorial.

""Abbott's no-yes-no-maybe record on Gonski is just the sort of bad policy approach about which the Coalition complained during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. The ideological thrust behind the arguments of Abbott and Pyne betray a reluctance to accept evidence.""

""There are serious doubts about the government's commitment to fair schools funding.""

""It's time Abbott stopped playing games with education and put children first,"" argued the Herald.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/624077094319383/?type=3,2013-12-03 20:16:43,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_621693017891124,"For Iranians the news is all bad. Take for example this story on Big News Network today courtesy of Spengler: Many commentators, most eloquently Bret Stephens at the Wall Street Journal, draw a parallel between the appeasement of Hitler at Munich in 1938 and the appeasement of Iran at Geneva. 

There is another, more chilling parallel: Iran's motive for proposing to annihilate the Jewish State is the same as Hitler's, and the world's indifference to the prospect of another Holocaust is no different today than it was in 1938. It is the dead's envy for the living.

Dying civilizations are the most dangerous, and Iran is dying. Its total fertility rate probably stands at just 1.6 children per female, the same level as Western Europe, a catastrophic decline from seven children per female in the early 1980s. Iran's present youth bulge will turn into an elderly dependent problem worse than Europe's in the next generation and the country will collapse. That is why war is likely, if not entirely inevitable.

Source: UN ""Low Variant""

The table above is drawn from United Nations projections. It probably underestimates Iran's predicament: the UN's ""low variant"" puts the country's total fertility rate at 1.9 children as of 2015, but it already has fallen to just 1.6. This means in simple arithmetic that a generation hence, there will be two elderly dependents for every three workers, compared to seven elderly dependents for every 93 workers today. That is a death sentence for a poor country, and at this point it is virtually irreversible.

As the United States Institute of Peace wrote in its April 2013 ""Iran Primer"":

    Iran's low fertility rate has produced a rapidly aging population, according to a new UN report. The rate has declined from 2.2 births per woman in 2000 to 1.6 in 2012. This has pushed the median age of Iranians to 27.1 years in 2010, up from 20.8 years in 2000. The median age could reach 40 years by 2030, according to the U.N. Population Division. An elderly and dependent population may heavily tax Iran's public health infrastructure and social security network.

In 2005 and 2006, I was the first Western analyst to draw strategic conclusions from this trend, the steepest decline in fertility in the history of the world. Iran must break out and establish a Shi'ite zone of power, or it will break down.

Iran's theocracy displays the same apocalyptic panic about its demographic future that Hitler expressed about the supposed decline of the so-called Aryan race. Unlike Hitler, whose racial paranoia ran wild, Iran's presentiment of national death is well founded on the facts.

That is not to understate Iran's paranoia. In 2013 Iran's vice president alleged that Jews ran the international drug trade. In a June 2013 Facebook post earlier this year, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei wrote, ""US President is being elected [sic] only from two parties while Zionist regime is controlling everything from behind the scenes."" That captions a cartoon showing fat men with moneybags for heads under a Star of David. Iranian officials routinely threaten to ""annihilate the Zionist regime"".

109808052412959_621053207955105,"The latest punishment of Gaza may seem like another familiar plot to humiliate the strip to the satisfaction of Israel, Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority, and the military-controlled Egyptian government. But something far more sinister is brewing. This time, the collective punishment of Gaza arrives in the form of raw sewage that is flooding many neighborhoods across the impoverished and energy-chocked region of 360 km2 (139 sq mi) and 1.8 million inhabitants, of which 55% are children according to the UN. Even before the latest crisis resulting from a severe shortage of electricity and diesel fuel that is usually smuggled through Egypt, Gaza was rendered gradually uninhabitable. A comprehensive UN report last year said that if no urgent action were taken, Gaza would be 'unlivable' by 2020. Since the report was issued in August 2012, the situation has grown much worse.

Over the years, especially since the tightening by Israel of the Gaza siege in 2007, the world has become accustomed to two realities: the ongoing multiparty scheme to weaken and defeat Hamas in Gaza, and Gaza's astonishing ability to withstand the inhumane punishment of an ongoing siege, blockade and war. 

Two infamous wars illustrate this idea: The first is Israel's 22-day war of 2008-9 (killing over 1,400 Palestinians and wounding over 5,500 more) and the second is its more recent war of Nov 2012 - eight days of fighting that killed 167 Palestinians and six Israelis. In the second war, Egypt's first democratically-elected president Mohammed Morsi was still in power. For the first time in many years, Egypt sided with Palestinians. Because of this and stiff Palestinian resistance in Gaza, the strip miraculously prevailed. Gaza celebrated its victory, and Israel remained somewhat at bay – while of course, mostly failing to honor its side of the Cairo-brokered agreement of easing Gaza's economic hardship. 

In relative terms, things seemed to be looking up for Gaza. The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt was largely opened, and both Egypt and the Hamas governments were in constant discussions regarding finding a sustainable economic solution to Gaza's many woes. But the ousting by General Abdel Fatah al-Sisi of President Morsi on July 3 changed all of that. The Egyptian military cracked down with vengeance by shutting down the border crossing and destroying 90 to 95 percent of all tunnels, which served as Gaza's main lifeline and allowed it to withstand the Israeli siege. 

Hopes were shattered quickly, and Gaza's situation worsened like never before. Naturally, Cairo found in Ramallah a willing ally who never ceased colluding with Israel in order to ensure that their Hamas rivals were punished, along with the population of the strip.

Citing Gaza officials, the New York Times reported a week ago, on Nov 21, that thirteen sewerage stations in the Gaza Strip have either overflowed or are close to overflowing, and 3.5 million cubic feet of raw sewage find their way to the Mediterranean Sea on a daily basis. ""The sanitation department may soon no longer be able to pump drinking water to Gaza homes,"" it reported.

Farid Ashour, the Director of sanitation at the Gaza Coastal Municipalities Water Utilities, told the Times that the situation is 'disastrous'. ""We haven't faced a situation as dangerous as this time,"" he said. But the situation doesn't have to be as dangerous or disastrous as it currently is. It has in fact been engineered to be that way. 

Gaza's only power plant has been a top priority target for Israeli warplanes for years. In 2006 it was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike, to be opened a year later, only to be destroyed again. And although it was barely at full capacity when it operated last, it continued to supply Gaza with 30 percent of its electricity needs of 400 megawatts. 120 megawatts came through Israel, and nearly 30 megawatts came through Egypt. The total fell short from Gaza's basic needs, but somehow Gaza subsisted. Following the ousting of Morsi and the Egyptian military crackdown, the shortage now stands at 65 percent of the total. 

In an interview with the UN humanitarian news agency, IRIN, James W. Rawley, the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, depicted a disturbing scene in which the impact of the crisis has reached ""all essential services, including hospitals, clinics, sewage and water pumping stations.""

Israelis on the other hand, have been doing just fine since the last military encounter with Hamas. ""The past year was a great one,"" The Economist quoted the commander of Israel's division that 'watches' Gaza, Brigadier Michael Edelstein. Due to the massive drop in the number of rockets fired from Gaza in retaliation to Israeli attacks and the continued siege (50 rockets this year, compared to 1,500 last year), ""children in Israel's border towns can sleep in their beds, not in shelters, and no longer go to school in armored buses,"" according to The Economist on Nov 16.

""But Israel's reciprocal promise to help revive Gaza's economy has not been kept,"" it reported. Israel has done everything it its power to keep Gaza in a crisis mode, from denying the strip solar panels so that they may generate their own electricity to blocking Gaza exports. ""In the meantime, Gaza is rotting away."" 

Desperate to find immediate remedies, Gaza Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh issued new calls to Mahmoud Abbas for a unity government. ""Let's have one government, one parliament and one president,"" Haniyeh said in a recent speech, as quoted by Reuters. A Fatah spokesman, Ahmed Assaf, dismissed the call saying it ""included nothing new."" Meanwhile, the PA decided to end its subsidy on any fuel shipped to Gaza via Israel, increasing the price to $1.62 per liter from 79 cents. According to Ihab Bessisso of the PA, the decision to rescind Gaza's tax exemption on fuel was taken because sending cheap fuel to Gaza ""was unfair to West Bank residents,"" according to the New York Times. 

But fairness has little to with it. Reports by The Economist, Al Monitor and other media speak of Egyptian efforts to reintroduce Gaza's former security chief and Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan to speed-up the anticipated collapse of the Hamas government. Al Monitor reported on Nov 21 that Dahlan, a notorious Fatah commander who was defeated by Hamas in 2007 because of, among other reasons, his close ties with Israeli intelligence, had met with General al-Sisi in Cairo. Evidently, the purpose is to oust Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the question is how? Some ""suggest that a Palestinian brigade mustered in al-Arish could march on Gaza and, with Egyptian support, defeat the broad array of Hamas forces created in the last decade."" 

With Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood out of the picture, at least for now, Gaza is more vulnerable than ever. Some of Abbas's supporters and certainly Dahlan's may believe that the moment to defeat their brethren in Gaza is now.

109808052412959_619817491412010,"The new Australian government has overturned the previous government's 'even-handed' policies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, throwing its weight firmly behind Israel. Recently-appointed foreign minister Julie Bishop said Monday she had reversed course on two major issues the subject of UN resolutions this month.

An annual UN resolution condemning the expansion of settlements in Israel, previously supported by the Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard governments, brought an abstention from the new Tony Abbott government. The resolution, which is tabled around this time each year, followed the announcement by Israel late last month that it was building 2,500 new homes, 1,531 of which will be constructed in the settler colony of Ramat Shlomo, which is disputed territory. Three other illegal settlement expansion projects comprising around 1,000 new houses were also approved. Tenders for 1,800 homes were advertised on November 3rd.,

Besides abstaining from condemning the new settlement expansions, Australia also abstained from a calling for the Geneva Convention to apply in the Palestinian territories.

The Australian Labor government had supported the resolution, also an annual occurrence, in recent years. 160 countries voted for the resoilution with only five abstaining including Australia.

""The (Australian) government will not support resolutions which are one-sided and which pre-judge the outcome of final status negotiations between the two sides,"" a spokesman for Bishop said Monday.

""This approach is reflected in the government's position on voting on Middle East-related resolutions in the UN,"" she said.

""Australia stands ready to assist in any way it can to support the efforts of Israel and the Palestinians to achieve lasting peace including supporting Palestinian development as an important contribution to the Middle East peace process.""

Former Australian foreign mininister in the Rugg and Gillard governments, Bob Carr, was disappointed at the change of direction.

""This new Australian stance is not the action of a true friend of Israel,"" told Fairfax Media on Monday.

""Our new position of condoning 'the settlement mission' of expansionist Israelis (opposed by other Israelis) undermines the prospect of a Palestinian state.""

Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek, who had not been advised, let alone contutled on the change in policy, said she was very surprised. ""I certainly didn't hear of any community consultation beforehand,"" she was quoted as saying on the ABC's Insiders program on Sunday.

""We voted yes to a proposition that has suggested that the unlimited building of settlements in land that is considered Palestinian land is not helping with the peace process.""

109808052412959_618327608227665,"Fifty years ago today it was rainy in Dallas but supposed to clear up later that morning. 

Over at Love Field airport, a young Times Herald reporter asked a Secret Service agent whether the clear, weatherproof top on the president's limousine was going to be used or not; the agent checked the forecast downtown and determined that the bubble top could be removed so the president could ride in the open-air.

Thirty-three miles away, John F. Kennedy, the reason for these preparations, woke in his room at the Hotel Texas, put on a dark suit and tie, and went downstairs to give an early speech in a nearby parking lot. Much to the crowd's disappointment, Jacqueline Kennedy, on her first official outing since the death of the couple's infant son in August, hadn't yet joined her husband. ""Mrs. Kennedy is organizing herself,"" the president told the audience. ""It takes her longer, but, of course, she looks better than we do when she does it.""

She would appear at breakfast shortly after, wearing a carnation pink suit and a matching pillbox hat.

The president was in Texas because he needed to be. It was a political trip, shoring up support for the state that had only narrowly elected him in 1960. After the morning in Fort Worth, he was to take a brief flight to Dallas and attend a luncheon at the wholesale Trade Mart. Dallas wasn't sure if it wanted to welcome him: A newspaper previewed his visit with the headline, ""Storm of Political Controversy Swirls Around Kennedy on Visit.""

But this morning was going well. The president's assistant appointments secretary, David Powers, tracked the schedule with a blue pen, crossing through completed events, marking adjustments for time delays. The 8:45 breakfast actually happened at 9, the hotel departure occurred at 10:35, not 10:30.

Shortly before noon, Air Force One touched down at Love Field, where the president and first lady transferred to the 1961 Lincoln Continental that the Secret Service called the X-100. Texas Gov. John B. Connally and his wife, Nellie, rode in the vehicle's jump seats. In another car were Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird. The weather had turned sunny and warm. The top was off.

In Dallas, it was a terrible week for Southern Methodist University fans; injuries incapacitated two of the football team's top three linebackers. Titche's department store had a special going on color televisions: $495, marked down from $725. The motorcade crawled through the downtown, past the Sanger-Harris on Main Street, where the department store's Santa Claus was set to make his first appearance of the holiday season.

Kennedy supporters lined the city streets, several deep. The two couples in the limousine didn't talk to each other much; they didn't want to appear to ignore the crowds. But as the X-100 turned off of Main Street, Nellie Connally, a vivacious woman in a rhubarb jacket, couldn't resist. At 12:29, she swiveled in her seat and buoyantly said to Kennedy, ""Mr. President, you can't say Dallas doesn't love you.""

And then, as crowds cheered and Jackie, enjoying her trip, smiled at them, the president of the United States was hit by his first bullet.

It tore through his flesh above his right shoulder blade, exiting at the base of his throat, and searing into John Connally's back. ""Oh no, no, no, no!"" the governor cried. An avid hunter, he immediately recognized the firecracker sounds that were coming from behind as rifle shots. ""My God, they are going to kill us all.""

A second bullet entered the right side of the president's head. Horrified, Abraham Zapruder, a women's clothing manufacturer who had been filming the procession with his new Bell and Howell Zoomatic, kept his camera on the scene before him and, in frame 313, captured Kennedy's skull exploding in a spray of pink and red.

Mrs. Connally cradled her wounded husband in the jump seat. She heard a Secret Service agent instructing the driver of the X-100 to drive to the nearest hospital. And she heard Jacqueline Kennedy behind her, repeating:

""They have killed my husband. I have his brains in my hand.""

The world had shifted, but nobody knew it yet.

Walter Cronkite brought the first news of the shooting to a national audience at 12:40 p.m. Central time. ""Here is a bulletin from CBS News,"" he read, interrupting a broadcast of ""As the World Turns."" Three shots were fired, he said. The president was reported to be seriously wounded.

In fact, the presidential motorcade had reached Parkland Memorial Hospital two minutes earlier, 8 minutes after the shooting. Doctors ushered Kennedy into Trauma Room 1, performed a tracheotomy, began chest compressions and placed a catheter in the president's arm. But he wasn't moving, his skin was grayish blue, and his head injuries were massive.

Back near the scene of the shooting, half a block behind the motorcade, Marion Baker, a 10-year veteran of the Dallas police, had heard the shots. He looked up to see pigeons flying off the top of the Texas Book Depository, and he sped his motorcycle in that direction.

Inside the warehouse, he noticed a man in a light-colored jacket and yelled, ""Come here!""

The man began to approach, but when Baker asked the building's superintendent, Roy Truly, whether he knew him, Truly affirmed that the jacketed man was a Book Depository employee. Baker let Lee Oswald go.

Upstairs on the sixth floor, police found a sniper's nest: stacked boxes for balancing a rifle, an empty soda pop bottle, and the grease and bones remaining from a fried chicken lunch.

At the hospital, Mrs. Kennedy demanded to be allowed in to the trauma room. Blood caked her stockings, her pink suit, her gloves. She was offered a sedative but refused one. Marion Thomas Jenkins, the chief of anesthesiology, saw her holding something in her hand. It was, indeed, a piece of brain.

Doctors pronounced the president dead at 1 p.m. Central time.

They wanted his body to remain at the hospital for a proper autopsy, but Secret Service agents insisted on removing it, driving it to Love Field where Lyndon Johnson was already aboard Air Force One. For security reasons, he was encouraged to get back to Washington, but he didn't want to leave Dallas without Jackie, who didn't want to leave without her husband's body.

On board, Johnson telephoned Bobby Kennedy. He was the president's brother, but at this point he was needed in a different capacity. When Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy picked up the phone, Johnson asked the stunned man for his legal opinion on whether he should take the oath of office while still in Dallas, and if so, what the exact words were.

Shortly after, Johnson's staff telephoned Sarah Hughes, a twangy-voiced U.S. District Court judge with whom Johnson was friends. She was instructed to come to the airport.

Police found Lee Oswald in a darkened movie theater during a screening of ""War Is Hell,"" where he'd hidden after shooting and killing J.D. Tippit, a 39-year-old patrolman who pulled him over for questioning.

""Well, it's all over now,"" Oswald told arresting officer Nick McDonald.

Twenty-seven people crowded into Air Force One's stateroom to witness Johnson's swearing in, two hours and eight minutes after President Kennedy was shot on Elm Street in downtown Dallas. Lady Bird Johnson stood on Johnson's right, a dazed-looking Jackie Kennedy stood on his left.

He repeated the 35-word oath, in a low, broken voice: ""I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

He and Sarah Hughes both added ""So help me God"" to the end. The new president ordered the plane and its grief home to Washington.

The neatly annotated presidential itinerary of David Powers would continue on through the afternoon, long after the schedule had been irreparably derailed. ""12:36 Carried my president on a stretcher,"" Powers would write in tidy cursive. ""2:15 Carried casket aboard Air Force One.""

A Secret Service agent would mop the blood out of the back seat of the X-100, not thinking of the evidence he was cleaning away or the conspiracy theories he was launching with every swipe. The car would be refurbished and put back into service, until its retirement in 1977.

The Times Herald journalist who had asked about the car's protective covering at Love Field on Friday morning was Jim Lehrer, who would go on to anchor PBS's ""NewsHour"" and who would always wonder what would have happened if he hadn't asked the Secret Service agent about the removal of the bubble top, even though he knew it wasn't bulletproof.

The carnation pink suit worn by the first lady would end up in the National Archives, still spattered with blood, banned from public display. The pillbox hat, last known to be in the possession of Mrs. Kennedy's secretary, would disappear.

On Nov. 22, 1963, she kept it on, through the two-hour flight, into the nighttime hours at Bethesda Naval Hospital for her husband's autopsy, through her pre-dawn return to the White House, where the president's body was placed in the East Room and guarded by servicemen representing each branch of the military.

Several times, people suggested she might like to change out of these clothes.

""No,"" she told them. ""Let them see what they have done.""

It had been 62 years since a presidential assassination. In 1901, William McKinley died eight days after a bullet pierced his abdomen in Buffalo, and what ultimately killed him was infection, not injury. McKinley's death was before the Secret Service became a presidential security detail, before air travel and Air Force One, before on-sale color televisions made it possible for a country to witness itself in mourning, reflected back in moving pictures.

Around the United States, people gathered to pray in churches but they also huddled at home around electronic boxes, finding community in isolation. On screen, dignitaries made pilgrimages to Washington to pay respects, and foreign heads of state expressed dismay from across oceans.

Late Friday at the White House, Caroline Kennedy, four days shy of her sixth birthday, and her brother John Jr., two days shy of his third, hadn't yet known of their father's death. Jackie's mother, Janet Auchincloss, asked her daughter at Bethesda Naval Hospital who should tell them, and Jackie said she could when she got home. Janet decided this was too much for her daughter to bear, and she instructed Maude Shaw, the Kennedys' British nanny, to tell the children herself.

""Please, no,"" Shaw begged on the telephone, keeping her voice low because the children were nearby. ""I can't take a child's last happiness from her.""

Mrs. Auchincloss insisted. In Caroline's room, Maude improvised. ""Your father has gone to look after Patrick,"" she said. ""Patrick was so lonely in heaven. He didn't know anybody there. Now he has the best friend anyone could have.""

In the hours before dawn on Saturday, Jackie returned to the White House and went to the East Room to visit her husband's body. She told the surrounding servicemen that she wanted to see Jack's face.

When the casket was opened, 23-year-old James Felder, an Army sergeant with 57 days left in his service, watched as Jackie snipped a piece of Kennedy's hair. She said, he remembered, ""He looks so waxen.""

The newly former first lady went back upstairs, where she finally managed a few hours of sedated sleep.

Necessary tasks propelled the family and staff through the day. At 9:05, the new President Johnson met with CIA Director John McCone. At 9:20, he met with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, followed by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. He spent two hours with former president Dwight Eisenhower, seeking advice on a proposed tax cut and on the foreign policy of Laos and Cuba. Several of President Kennedy's senior advisers offered to resign, to honor the changing of an administration. Johnson declined.

When Jackie woke, she told her staff to begin packing for the family's inevitable departure from the White House. By the afternoon, her husband's office was empty, save for his desk, two telephones, and a rug. Presumably searching for something with which to occupy herself, Mrs. Kennedy sat down at her writing desk, sketching out the executive residence's capacity to accommodate visitors for the funeral weekend: ""3rd floor 5 Single 2 Double,"" she wrote on a sheet of White House stationery.

Her longtime personal assistant, Providencia Paredes, who had packed the pink suit for the Dallas trip, busied herself in Jackie's dressing room, organizing clothes and accessories. ""I just wanted to be near her,"" Providencia says now, in case she needed anything. But all the first lady accepted that weekend was tea.

Paredes would later go to work for Robert Kennedy, until five years later, when he, too, was assassinated, in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. She would then work for Ted Kennedy, until his involvement in the drowning death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick. And then, after the third bloody tragedy involving a Kennedy brother and good friend, Paredes would take a sedate job in the library division of the U.S. Postal Service, until her retirement in 1992.

On Saturday afternoon, members of the military honor guard, who would double as pallbearers, quietly drove to Fort Myer in Arlington, Va., and unloaded a practice casket.

The team had just rehearsed a presidential funeral, anticipating the death of ailing Herbert Hoover. But Kennedy's mahogany coffin from Gawler's funeral home was much heavier than anyone anticipated; pallbearers wanted to make sure they could maintain their precision as they bore its weight up the Capitol steps and into the Rotunda, where the former president was to lie in state on Sunday.  

They would practice again the next day, this time at Arlington National Cemetery. When the bags of sand they put in the casket didn't seem heavy enough, they improvised again; with two servicemen sitting atop the casket, they carried it up and down the steps of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

From the assassination Friday until after the funeral on Monday, James Felder, who would later go on to become a lawyer, and then a voting rights advocate, and then a state representative for South Carolina, got a total of six hours of sleep. He was too tired to mourn. Seven days after President Kennedy's funeral, Felder received a call from the wife of his commanding officer, Michael Groves. She told him that Michael had died of a heart attack at dinner, and she wanted Felder to be a pallbearer at his funeral. ""That's when it hit me,"" Felder now remembers. ""In 10 days, I had buried the commander in chief and my company commander. And then I cried.""

Emotions were off-kilter on Saturday. Soldiers became numb, and nursemaids were wracked with guilt. The moving images on television never stopped. A heavy mood rolled in and united the nation on the first full day of mourning.

The most extreme manifestation of a general state of anguish hadn't happened yet, but it would, the next day, at 11:21 a.m.

Lee Oswald had been held in a cell in the Dallas city jail, but he was scheduled to move to County on Sunday morning. Detectives and FBI agents questioned him several times after his arrest on Friday. Even when confronted with evidence, he never confessed to shooting the president or J.D. Tippit. Police found him smug and smirking, telling obvious lies with ease.

Across town in his apartment, Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner with a grandiose sense of self-importance, opened the Sunday Times Herald. He saw a letter beginning ""My Dear Caroline,"" addressed to the president's daughter and written by a local father. Another article mentioned that Mrs. Kennedy might have to return to Dallas for Oswald's trial. Ruby had adored Kennedy, and he was filled with rage at this final insult, at the thought of another burden placed on the man's widow.

He drove to the city jail, stopping first at the nearby Western Union to send a money order to one of his employees, and then walked to the exit ramp of the jail where police had said they would bring Oswald through for his transfer.

At 20 minutes after 11, Oswald appeared, in a borrowed black sweater, flanked by Detectives L.C. Graves and James Leavelle. The media swarmed the area, television cameras ready to broadcast his face to the country. Ruby blended in - he was on a first-name basis with a lot of police officers, who frequented his club. He had a .38-caliber Colt Cobra in his pocket, and now he grabbed it and reached for Oswald's torso.

""You killed my president,"" he said, and pulled the trigger.

Oswald was taken by ambulance to Parkland Memorial, where he died at 1:07 p.m. Central time in Trauma Room 2. Medical staff hadn't wanted to put him in Trauma Room 1. That's where they had attended to President Kennedy 48 hours before.

At the White House, some members of the president's casket team watched Oswald's slaying on television from their makeshift headquarters downstairs but couldn't stay to witness the aftermath. Instead, they had to move John Kennedy's body from the White House's North Portico to a caisson waiting outside to begin the procession to the U.S. Capitol.

The casket team, well practiced from its session at Fort Myer, passed an estimated 300,000 people lining the streets. They arrived at the steps of the Capitol, followed by Jackie, Bobby and the two children. President and Mrs. Johnson were also there. The Navy band played a solemn rendition of ""Hail to the Chief.""

At 1:52 p.m., Jackie Kennedy, who in the course of a weekend had insisted on wearing her bloody pink suit as a message to the nation, who had resolutely made the funeral plans, who had mapped out bedroom logistics for visiting guests, heard the opening notes of this presidential tune, bowed her head to her chest, and sobbed.

At the end of the ceremony, after President Johnson laid a wreath, waiting crowds were allowed to file into the Capitol Rotunda and past the president's closed casket, two lines moving at an average of 35 people per minute.

The Capitol was supposed to close at 9 p.m., but by that time, visitors were still lined up in near-freezing temperatures all the way to D.C. Stadium, two miles away. Officials decided to extend visitation hours through the night.

People drove from Richmond and Connecticut, hundreds of miles, for the public viewing. Thirty-six nuns from New Jersey arrived on a rented bus; two teenagers arrived on foot from Baltimore, a 35-mile walk away; the famous heavyweight boxer Jersey Joe Walcott quietly appeared and waited in line like everyone else.

The death of President Kennedy was already becoming a narrative of the nation, a story it told about itself. A blend of minute factual detail and epic myth. Months after the funeral, when Kennedy family friend William Manchester would begin work on his book ""The Death of a President,"" he would find that people claimed to remember things they couldn't possibly have seen, or personally visited places that had only been shown on camera.

The ownership of the gun used by Jack Ruby would become the source of a bitter rift among his heirs, long after Ruby died of cancer in 1967, at Parkland Memorial Hospital.

President Johnson would ride home from Sunday's events at the Capitol under a new dawn of security, with a police officer ordered to monitor every building he passed for snipers.

The United States would never stop telling this story, as a loss of innocence, as a time of unity, as a rote memory.

More than 200 officials from more than 100 countries attended the president's state funeral, the apex of official mourning. Ten prime ministers. Twenty-two presidents. Kings and queens and emperors. It was 42 degrees in Washington, four degrees cooler than average for that day, and windy. Everybody walked, in the open air, from the White House to St. Matthew's Cathedral, seven-tenths of a mile away.

The funeral caisson was followed by Black Jack, the riderless horse symbolizing the fallen master. Black Jack was generally known to be calm and settled. During his career, he participated in more than 1,000 funerals. On Monday, he bucked and misbehaved through the entire procession, at one point kicking the foot of Arthur Carlson, the 19-year-old Army private who was his handler. Carlson thought his foot was broken. He spent the rest of the day in poker-faced throbbing pain, thinking about how angry he was at his horse and about how he could not show it to the hundreds of thousands of people lining the route.

""I'm from Mobile, Alabama, and I've been to a lot of Mardi Gras parades,"" remembers Carlson, now a retired oil rig worker. ""Whenever we have a parade there, people are noisy. It's a big party."" As he walked the route from the Capitol to St. Matthew's to Arlington Cemetery on Monday, lined by an estimated a million people, he said: ""I've never seen that many people be that quiet. It must have been eight or 10 people deep, the whole way, and they were all as still as statues.""

In Dallas, seven hundred uniformed police officers arrived at the Beckley Hills Baptist Church to mourn J.D. Tippit, the policeman who was killed on the same day as the president.

In Dallas, no one aside from immediate family arrived for the burial of Lee Harvey Oswald, not even the Lutheran minister who had originally agreed to officiate at the ceremony. He was buried in the only cemetery that would take his body. His casket was carried to its grave site by the reporters who had shown up to cover the funeral.

In Washington, Caroline Kennedy and Maude Shaw produced a toy helicopter and a picture book, and sang ""Happy Birthday"" to John, who was turning 3.

Bishop Philip Hannan, participating in the president's funeral service at St. Matthew's, read five passages of scripture and then read Kennedy's inaugural address as a testament to the man. Three years earlier, Kennedy, a friend, had asked Hannan after the inauguration what he thought of the speech. The bishop told him the words were good but that Kennedy hadn't read it slowly enough. Now, inside the packed and emotional cathedral, Hannan read it slowly.

At 1:30, the funeral procession left St. Matthew's and proceeded to Arlington, where the burial site had been prepared by Clifton Pollard, a gravedigger who normally dug nine or 10 graves in a day, but for this occasion had spent several hours perfecting one.

Jackie had requested an eternal flame for the grave site. She'd seen one at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and found it moving; this one in Arlington was constructed by military engineers. Cardinal Richard Cushing had been asked to bless it and, after some research, determined there was no special blessing for an eternal flame.

After the Marine Band played the hymn ""Eternal Father,"" he chanted the general benediction ad Omnia - to all - over the torch's copper tubing.

The burial completed, the Kennedy family returned to the White House for a reception.

President Johnson went to a budget meeting.

Cardinal Cushing went to the airport to catch a flight.

Black Jack, once again docile and well behaved, returned to his stable.

Shortly before midnight at the White House, once Charles de Gaulle had left and the Duke of Edinburgh had left - once everyone had left, Bobby Kennedy turned to Jackie and asked, ""Should we go visit our friend?""

Jackie took some lilies of the valley from a cup on a hall table, and the brother- and sister-in-law drove back to Arlington, which was now empty and dark. As Monday ended, Jackie, who would later become Jacqueline Onassis, who would later become Jackie O, who would die in 1994 of non-Hodgkins lymphoma after returning to the White House only once in her life despite repeated invitations, left the bouquet next to the eternal flame.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/618327608227665/?type=3,2013-11-21 21:36:24,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_614401165286976,"In an initially pointless exercise that lasted nearly an hour, I flipped between two Palestinian television channels, Al Aqsa TV of Hamas in Gaza and Palestine TV of Fatah in the West Bank. 

While both purported to represent Palestine and the Palestinians, each seemed to represent some other place and some other people. It was all very disappointing.
 
Hamas' world is fixated on their hate of Fatah and other factional personal business. Fatah TV is stuck between several worlds of archaic language of phony revolutions, factional rivalry and unmatched self-adoration. The two narratives are growingly alien and will unlikely ever move beyond their immediate sense of self-gratification and utter absurdity.
 
It is no wonder why Palestinians are still struggling to tell the world such a simple, straightforward and truthful story. Perhaps it is now out of desperation that they expect Israel's New Historians, internationals who make occasional visits to Palestine or an unexceptionally fair western journalist to tell it.
 
But what about the Palestinians themselves? This is rare because factionalism in Palestine and among Palestinians in the Diaspora is also destroying the very idea of having a common narrative through which they can tell one cohesive story, untainted by the tribal political mentality which is devouring Palestinian identity the same way Israeli bulldozers are devouring whatever remains of their land.
 
Even if such a narrative were to finally exist, it would likely be an uphill battle, for Israel's official narrative, albeit a forgery, is rooted in history. On May 16, 2013, Shay Hazkani, described in a detailed Haaretz article the intricate and purposeful process through which Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion rewrote history. ""Catastrophic thinking: Did Ben-Gurion try to rewrite history?"" was largely based on a single file (number GL-18/17028) in the State Archives that seemed to have escaped censorship. The rest of the files were whisked away after Israel's New Historians – Benny Morris, Avi Shlaim, Tom Segev, Ilan Pappe and others – got their hands on numerous documents that violently negated Israel's official story of its birth.  
 
""Archived Israeli documents that reported the expulsion of Palestinians, massacres or rapes perpetrated by Israeli soldiers, along with other events considered embarrassing by the establishment, were reclassified as 'top secret',"" Hazkani wrote in the Israeli paper. But GL-18/17028 somehow survived the official onslaught on history.
 
The lone document spoke of the ""evolution of the Israeli version of the Palestinian Nakba (The Catastrophe) of 1948."" That evolution took place under the auspices of Ben-Gurion himself between the years 1960-1964, where he assigned one scholar after another to basically fabricate history, which they surely did. Zionist leaders were at least astute enough to understand the power of collective memory, and its possible impact on international public opinion. So they tailored their own versions of history very early on so as to counter future generations of Palestinians.

Salman Abu Sitta is one of Palestine's foremost historians. The man has done more to preserve and document Palestinian historical records than any other historian alive. In an interview with Lebanon's Al-Akhbar newspaper on August 5, 2012, Abu Sitta was, of course, fully aware of the Israeli attempts at restyling history. ""The Israeli maps of the 1950s were nothing more than the British survey of Palestine maps overwritten in Hebrew,"" he said. ""From 1960 onwards, the Israel survey department started to issue maps devoid of all these original Palestinian names, and replaced them with Hebrew ones.""
 
The reference to 1960 retrospectively corroborates Hazkani's story based on the enduring file GL-18/17028.
 
Six and a half decades later that fight continues, between Israel's attempts to erase the history of Palestine, while Palestinians, through independent efforts (no thanks to the warring factions) try to preserve their own. ""The war runs along several fronts, not only militarily, but it is also a battle over the minds of people…We are not trying to obliterate any other history – we are trying to say that we will not allow you (Israel) to erase ours,"" Abu Sitta explained.
 
Yet Israel's effort at abolishing Palestinian history never ceased, starting with the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages and expelling their populations in 1947-48, to rewriting maps, to changing names of towns and streets, to manufacturing alternate histories, to more recently, outlawing Palestinian memory. Yes, precisely that.
 
In March 2011, the Israeli Knesset (parliament) passed what is known as the ""Nakba bill"". It financially penalizes any organization or institution that perceives and commemorates Israel's founding as a day of mourning for Palestinians. The law, officially known as ""Budget Principles Law (Amendment 39) - Reducing Budgetary Support for Activities Contrary to the Principles of the State,"" was as a continuation of Ben-Gurion's project of physically erasing Palestinians, severing their rapport with their own land, and presenting a construct of history to the rest of the world - a history that was deliberately misconstrued by few individuals following official instructions.
 
Alas, a largely invented history that is so focused and well-funded seems to trump genuine history that is mostly distorted by the incompetence of its owners. True, there are other Abu Sitta type historians, who see Palestinians through the transparency of the collective, not the distorted prisms of individuals or factions. Their voices however are muffled and trounced by overwhelming odds – the Hamas vs. Fatah vs. the rest, the division of the national identity based on geography, politics and funds, among other factors. 

The current generation of Palestinians is yet to have a fully comprehensive, well-funded, long-term national Palestinian project that spans limited group interests and geography; one that is manned by qualified, well-trained Palestinian historians, spokespersons and scholars, so that a broad and unswerving Palestinian narrative can be presented throughout the world. All such efforts remain the responsibility of single individuals and small organizations with limited means, thus with narrowed outreach. But without such a unifying platform, it will be immensely difficult for the Palestinian narrative to reach the critical mass needed to overpower the fictitious Israeli version of Palestinian history which continues to define mainstream thinking in many parts of the world, especially in the West.
 
The work of Israel's New Historians has been immensely valuable, although one cannot compare the compassion of such historians as Pappe, with the harshness of Morris. The hundreds of other accounts offered by outsiders are also important, for they help in creating frames of references to which their specific audiences around the world can relate. But without a unified Palestinian narrative, massive in its magnitude, striking in its consistency, and all-inclusive in its presentation, the Israeli story, as fallacious as it is, will continue to define the mainstream understanding of history for years to come.

109808052412959_604702256256867,"Less than 50 days on the job, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has angrily attacked his predecessors in an extraordinary interview published by The Washington Post. 

""I thought it was the most incompetent and untrustworthy government in modern Australian history,"" Abbott told 'Post interviewer Lally Weymouth.

""They made a whole lot of commitments, which they scandalously failed to honor. They did a lot of things that were scandalously wasteful and the actual conduct of government was a circus,"" the newly-elected Australian prime minister said. ""They were untrustworthy in terms of the carbon tax.They were incompetent in terms of the national broadband network. They were a scandal when it came to their own internal disunity. They made a whole lot of grubby deals in order to try and perpetuate themselves in power. It was an embarrassing spectacle, and I think Australians are relieved they are gone.""

The standing convention by most politicians around the world not to criticise their government overseas, and the second convention of newly-won governments not to overly criticise their predecessors seemed to have been forgotten. In the United States even President Obama shows respect to the widely unpopular George W. Bush who preceded him. 

Abbott however was having none of it. He weighed into the former Labor government providing The Washington Post's American audience with a close-up blow-by-blow narrative of everything he thought was wrong with the way the previous government went about their job.

He even described the popular NBN (National Broadband Network) as ""wacko.""

Surprised that the former government was building the NBN, the interviewer asked how it came about.

""It's a government-owned telecommunications infrastructure monopoly, which was proceeding at a scandalous rate without producing any commensurate outcomes. We are changing the objective from fiber to every premise in the country to fiber to distribution points, and then we will use the existing infrastructure to take the broadband to individual premises,"" Abbott replied.

""Is that cheaper and more efficient?,"" asked Weymouth.

""Vastly,"" said Abbott.

""But Labor wanted to extend fiber to every household? , queried The Washington Post interviewer.

""Welcome to the wonderful, wacko world of the former government,"" Abbott responded.

The Australian prime minister took aim at climate-change believers, particularly those linking the current spate of bushfires in New South Wales to climate change. ""I'm not one of those people who runs around and says every time there's a fire or a flood, that proves climate change is getting worse. Australia has had fires and floods since the beginning of time. We've had much bigger floods and fires than the ones we've recently experienced. You can hardly say they were the result of anthropic global warming,"" he said.

""This argument has become far too theological for anyone's good. I accept that climate change is a reality. And I support policies that will be effective in reducing emissions, but I do think there is too much climate-change alarmism."" 

Australia's new leader also weighed into the ex government on its asylum-seekers policy.

""This is a massive illegal immigration racket, which the former government summoned into existence by changing policies that had been put in place,"" he said. ""They abolished offshore processing of illegal boat arrivals, and they abolished the temporary-protection visas that illegal boat arrivals were placed on. Their changes meant that if you got here, you could stay here. Traffic, which had been stopped, started up again. A trickle became a flow, and a flow became a flood. In July of this year, we had illegal arrivals by boat at an annual rate of 50,000, which is a massive influx. Now the numbers have slowed dramatically, particularly since the election.

Asked if Australia can't support a bigger population, Abbott replied, ""Of course we can support a bigger population, but people have to come in the front door, not the back door.""

Asked if the carbon tax would be abolished this year, an election campaign promise by the Liberal National Party coalition, Mr. Abbott said ""As soon as possible. If the Labor Party wants to give the people of Australia a Christmas present, they will vote to abolish the carbon tax. It was damaging the economy without helping the environment. It was a stupid tax. A misconceived tax.""

The Washington Post interviewer noted The Australian PM in his victory speech had announced Australia was open for business again, asking if he thought the previous government was unfriendly to businesses.

""I said Australia is under new management and is once again open for business. The previous government would often say the right thing but it would invariably do the wrong thing when it came to business,"" he replied. ""There was an explosion in red tape and green tape. There was a whole thicket of new restrictions in the labour market. There were big new taxes. It was a government which thought that there was no problem that more public servants, higher taxes and further regulation couldn't fix.""

""So you're reversing that?"" Weymouth asked Abbott.

""We will do our damnedest to shrink the public service and have a bonfire of red tape and unnecessary taxes,"" he replied.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/604702256256867/?type=3,2013-10-26 17:56:17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sheldon Adelson, described by Forbes magazine as the 12th richest American, made his estimated $34 billion in IT and subsequently by purchasing and building casinos. On Tuesday night this week though he was giving his views on Iran and its nuclear energy program. Participating in a forum at Yeshiva University he ridiculed American efforts to negotiate with the Iranians and suggested the U.S. military should drop a nuclear bomb in the desert parts of the country as a warning shot, with a threat to repeat the exercise in Tehran if the Iranians refused to negotiate. Adelson, who is Jewish, publishes the Israeli daily newspaper Israel HaYom. Born in Boston, Massachusetts, the magnate came to fame in 1979 when he and his associates inaugurated the  computer trade show COMDEX for the then-burgeoning computer industry. Less than a yera later he headed a bid to buy the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Today as Chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation he oversees substantial casino operations in Las Vegas and Macau, including the Venetian casino resorts, and the multi-billion dollar Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. At Tuesday night's forum the billionaire was asked by moderator Rabbi Shmuley Boteach what he thought about the currently mooted negotiations between the U.S. and Iran. ""What are we going to negotiate about,?"" Adelson replied. He then put forward his proposition that an Iranian official be contacted and told to ""watch this,"" while the U.S. military dropped a nuclear bomb in the Iranian desert. ""Then you say, 'See. The next one is in the middle of Tehran. So, we mean business. You want to be wiped out? Go ahead and take a tough position and continue with your nuclear development. You want to be peaceful? Just reverse it all, and we will guarantee you that you can have a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes, energy purposes',"" he said. ""So a tremendous demonstration of American strength?"" Boteach asked. ""So that they would get the message? It's the only thing they understand,"" Adelson responded. ""And do you see the current negotiations as a sign of weakness?"" Boteach queried. ""Absolutely,"" Adelson said. ""It's the worst negotiating tactic I could ever imagine, my entire life. Because you can't get anything. He's not saying to them, roll back your entire program and show that you're willing to be peaceful. So, roll it all back and we'll roll back the sanctions.

109808052412959_603199006407192,"The warm waters of the Gulf look quiet from where I am sitting, but such tranquility hardly reflects the conflicts this region continues to generate. The euphoria of the so-called Arab Spring is long gone, but what remains is a region that is rich with resources and burdened with easily manipulated history that is in a state of reckless transition. No one can see what the future will look like, but the possibilities are ample, and possibly tragic.

In my many visits to the region, I have never encountered such a lack of clarity regarding the future, despite the fact that battle lines have been drawn like never before. Governments, intellectuals, sects and whole communities are lining up at both sides of many divides. This is taking place to various degrees everywhere in the Middle East, depending on the location of the conflict.

Some countries are directly engulfed in bloody and defining conflicts - revolutions gone astray, as in Egypt, or uprisings turned into most-destructive civil wars as in Syria. Conversely, those who are for now spared the agony of war, are very much involved in funding various war parties, transporting weapons, training fighters and leading media campaigns in support of one party against another. No such elusive concept as media objectivity exists anymore, not even in relative terms.

Yet in some instances, the lines are not drawn with any degree of certainty either. Within the ranks of Syria's opposition to the Ba'ath regime in Damascus, the groups are too many to count, and their own alliances shift in ways that few in the media seem to notice or care to report. We arbitrarily write of an 'opposition', but in reality there are no truly unifying political or military platforms, whether it be the Supreme Military Council, the Syria National Council or the Syrian National Coalition. In an interactive map, formulated by Al Jazeera mostly on what seems like wholesale conclusions, the military council ""claims it commands about 900 groups and a total of at least 300,000 fighters."" The claim of actual control over these groups can be easily contended, and there are numerous other groups that operate based on their own agendas, or unified under different military platforms with no allegiance to any political structure, not those in Istanbul or elsewhere.

It is easy however to associate perpetual conflict with the supposedly inherently violent Middle East. For nearly two decades, many warned that American military intervention in Iraq would eventually 'destabilize' the entire region. The term 'destabilize' was of course a relevant one, since Israel has done more than its fair share to destabilize several countries, occupy some and destroy others. But the prospects of political destabilization were much more ominous when the world's most powerful country invested much of its might and financial resources to do the job.

In 1990-91, then again in 2003, and once more in 2006, Iraq was used as a giant field of experimentation for war, 'state building' and US-provoked civil war. The region had never experienced such division to accommodate sectarian lines as it did then. The discourse that adjoined the US war was brazenly sectarian of the Shia-majority oppressed by the Sunni-minority. They rearranged one of the most complex political landscapes in the world within a few weeks, based on a blueprint imagined by Washington-based 'experts' with little real life experience. Not only was Iraq torn into shreds, but it was remade repeatedly to accommodate America's inept understanding of history.

Iraq continues to suffer, even after the US purportedly withdrew its military. Thousands have perished in Iraq in recent months, with victims labeled as members of one sect or another. But the Iraqi ailment has now become a regional condition. And like the US when it invades sovereign countries and rearranges political borders, groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) operate wherever they find their calling with no respect for geographical borders. Formed in Iraq in 2006 as a platform for various Jihadi groups like al-Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS has been a powerful component of the savage war underway in Syria. Despite its bad reputation, it seems to have little problem finding access and resources. Worse, in parts of Syria it actually operates a somewhat stable economy that gives it greater privilege than homegrown Syrian groups.

Such groups would have never existed in Iraq, or move with relative ease to other countries, if it had not been for the US invasion. They operate like private armies, divided into smaller bands of battle-hardened fighters that are capable of navigating their way through borders and taking control over entire communities. Al-Qaeda, once a barely known group 12-years-ago, has now become a stakeholder in the future of entire Middle Eastern countries.

For countries that are not undergoing the type of upheaval being experienced in Syria and Iraq, they however understand that it is too late to play the role of the spectator. It is an all-out war in the making, and there is no time for neutrality. Worrying predictions of the changing physical landscape of the region are well underway and few countries seem to be spared.

Robin Wright's recent piece in the New York Times, ""Imagining a Remapped Middle East"" is a typical speculation made by American political and media elites about the Middle East. They applied it in earnest before and after the US invasion of Iraq, where they carved the Arab country into whatever amalgamation that suited US interests, in a typical divide and rule formula. This time however, the prospects are frighteningly serious and real. All the major players, even if ostensibly opposing one another, are in fact contributing to the plausible division. According to Wright, not only could countries become a few smaller ones, some of the carved territories could tie into the cut pieces of neighboring countries. 

Even ""city-states - oases of multiple identities like Baghdad, well-armed enclaves like Misurata, Libya's third largest city, or homogeneous zones like Jabal al-Druze in southern Syria - might make a comeback, even if technically inside countries,"" he wrote. The accompanying info-graphic was entitled: ""How 5 Countries Could Become 14.""

Whether such events will ever actualize, the prediction is itself telling of the undeniably shifting nature of conflict in the Middle East, where countries are now embroiled in war. The new battle lines are now sectarian, carrying symptoms of Iraq's relentless civil war. In fact, the players are more or less the same, except that the 'game' has now been spread to exceed Iraq's porous borders into much wider spaces where militants have the upper hand.

From here, the warm waters of the Gulf look quiet, but deceptively so.

109808052412959_599531906773902,"Interesting article by Ramzy Baroud about the situation in Yemen is appearing on Big News Network today:

On Oct 12, tens of thousands of Yemenis took to the streets of Eden in the South of the country, mostly demanding secession from the north. 

The date is significant, for it marks the 1967 independence of South Yemen, ending several decades of British colonialism. But for nearly five decades since then, Yemen is yet to find political stability, a semblance of economic prosperity, and, most importantly, settle the question of its national identity.

It has been two years and nine months since a large protest has occurred in the Yemeni capital. Sana'a initiated what was quickly named the Yemeni revolution and ignited media frenzy that Yemen had officially joined the so-called Arab Spring. Seeing Yemen as a member of the 'Arab Spring' club, as opposed to appreciating the Arab country's own unique historical and political circumstances, was a media shortcut that failed to explain the vast majority of events that followed the early Yemeni youth protests on Jan 27, 2011.

One of the most significant dates of the massive protests against the 33-year role of now deposed President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family's strong hold over state institutions was Feb 3rd. It was then that both Sana'a and Eden stood united under one banner. It was a momentous day because both cities once served as capitals of two warring countries. The youth of Yemen were able to fleetingly bridge a gap that neither politicians nor army generals managed to close despite several agreements and years of bloody conflicts. But that collective triumph of the Yemeni people was only felt on the streets of the country, overwhelmed by poverty and destitution, but also compelled by hope. That sentiment was never truly translated to a clear political victory, even after Saleh was deposed in Feb 2012.

Since then a National Dialogue Conference (NDC) was convened with representations from various political parties, major tribes, youth movements and delegates representing South and North. Its job was to usher in the process of drafting a constitution by organizing a referendum and general elections. Sep 18, 2013 was recognized as a deadline for these major tasks to be accomplished, but that date slipped away. Even worse, deep divisions began showing between all parties involved. Initially, the dialogue attempted to explore commonalities between delegates representing the ruling General People's Congress (GPC) and the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP), representing the opposition. However, conflict soon ensued between members of the JMP themselves.

JMP is made of several opposition parties, including the Islamic-leaning Yemeni Congregation for Reform (Islah) whose core supporters are based in the North, and the secularist Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), based in the South. These two parties hail from entirely different ideological schools of thought, and were not always united by their wish to defeat Saleh's ruling GPC. There was a time in which the Islah, seen as Yemen's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, allied with Saleh to defeat socialists. ""The socialist expansion emanating from the South bolstered the Brotherhood's alliance with Saleh's regime during the wars for the central regions (1978-1982) against what they called the communist tide,"" wrote Farea al-Muslimi for Al-Monitor.

In those years, today's Republic of Yemen was two different countries: a Marxist-Leninist South Yemen, and North Yemen. After years of conflict in which both sides were used to channel regional rivalries and an international Cold War, they became united on May 22, 1990. Soon after the union, a process of democratization, elections, wealth sharing and more was initiated, but quickly fell apart. Southern leaders began speaking of a conspiracy to deprive their less populated, yet wealthier southern and eastern parts of the country of its resources by the tribal-dominated North. In 1994, political conflict quickly descended into civil war where the South was defeated and thousands of its leaders and military men fled. Efforts at reconciliation fell short. The sense of injustice that southerners continue to feel towards the dominant North is a notion that is challenged by many. But it is real and has never been seriously discussed, let alone resolved through a transparent political medium overseen by a democratic leadership.

The current Yemeni Socialist Party is composed by remnants of the dissolved leadership of South Yemen. Although the Yemeni revolt of Jan 2011 ignited much national fervor throughout the country, talks of succession began resurfacing later on, when Yemenis, especially in the South, began losing faith in the political transition and the National Dialogue Conference. Another contributing factor is the state of utter security chaos experienced throughout Yemen, some of which is al-Qaeda-lead or inspired violence, much of which targets southern towns and activists. Some in the South accuse Sana'a of facilitating or allowing such violence to perpetuate to achieve political ends.

Moreover JMP, which was slated as the united front of the opposition, became a major source of tension, for the socialists deeply mistrust the Islah, and the latter, which strongly objects to any division of the country, is equally suspicious of its supposed political ally. When the Egyptian military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi, Islah's supporters protested in fury, while the socialists celebrated with utter delight. Trust, indeed, was at an all-time low.

Not that the South is united, for the Southern Movement Hiraak, which advocates a two-state federalism followed by a referendum on the future of the South, is marred by division. Hiraak is composed of many political parties and factions and is torn by competing leaderships. That division was displayed on Oct 12 during the marking of South Yemen's independence. Some participating factions carried pictures of Egyptian military general Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, who overthrew Morsi, while others waved flags of Lebanon's Hezbollah. The political divide soon erupted in bloody clashes in Parade Square, in central Eden, where some were reportedly injured.

On Oct 8, only a few days prior to the Eden rallies, President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who was installed following the ouster of Saleh, declared the country's national dialogue was about to bear a long anticipated result. In fact, it was only ""a few days away"" from establishing a ""united and federal Yemen"", a language so carefully used as to sway both sides of the divide. But his anticipated breakthrough seemed irrelevant in the face of compellingly discouraging facts, lead amongst them is that factions affiliated with the Southern Movement are boycotting the talks. Also, the signing of any accords ""has been put off as the two representatives of Saleh's General People's Congress walked out and the GPC suspended its participation, rejecting any bid to 'harm the unity of the homeland,'"" reported Arab News.

Even if such an accord is ever signed, the National Dialogue Conference cannot enforce any agreement that lacks a clear mandate and popular approval. Uniting a 'homeland' around similar ideas as a rebellion continues to brew in the North, a secessionist movement gathers steam in the South, an unending US drone war carries on, rampant militancy moves ahead, and punishing poverty thrives throughout the country, is no easy task. We must ask if under these circumstances, it is even possible at all.

109808052412959_588578744535885,"Ramzy Baroud has taken issue with the New York Times in a piece on Big News Network today. Here's the story:

Mark Landler is a White House correspondent for The New York Times.

Under the title ""Through Diplomacy, Obama Finds a Pen Pal in Iran"", Landler wrote of President Barack Obama's deep ""belief in the power of the written word,"" and of his ""frustrating private correspondence with the leaders of Iran."" (NYT, Sep. 19)

What is also frustrating is the unabashed snobbery of Landler's and the NYT's narrative regarding Iran: that of successive US administrations trying their best and obstinate Iranian leaders stereotyped and derided - who always fail to reciprocate. This is all supposedly changing though since the new Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, who they present as different and approachable, and has decided to break ranks with his predecessors.

This is of course hardly an appropriate framing of the story. While a friendly exchange of letters between Rouhani and Obama is a welcomed development in a region that is torn between failed revolutions, civil wars and the potential of an all-out regional conflict, it is not true that it is Rouhani's personality that is setting him apart from his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Rouhani's 'charm offensive' as described by the Times is a 'process' that 'has included the release of 11 prominent political prisoners and a series of conciliatory statements by top Iranian officials.' It is natural then, we are meant to believe, that Obama would make his move and apply his writing skills in earnest. Israel was not mentioned in the story even once, as if the fact that Israel's decade-long advocacy of sanctioning and bombing Iran has not been the single greatest motive behind the deteriorating relations between Washington and Tehran, long before Ahmadinejad was painted by US media, NYT included, as the devil incarnate.

Dominant US media is unlikely to adjust its attitude towards Iran and the rest of the Middle East anytime soon: the perceived enemies will remain enemies and the historic allies as in Israel only will always be that. While that choosy discourse has been the bread and butter of US media from elitist publications like the NYT to demagogues like Fox News that one-sidedness will no longer suffice as the Middle East region is vastly changing in terms of alliances and power plays.

Iran's internal politics is multifarious, and the country's location in a geopolitically complex region makes it impossible, needless to say unfair, to confine the country's existence to the US whims and expectations. It is US impulses, not the Iranian's leader lack of letter writing skills that made the relationship extremely difficult since the breakup 34 years ago. Since then, it has been one pretense after the other. At the heart of the US argument is Israel's security a doctrine that simply means total Israeli military domination over its neighbors. US insistence to rule over a region it perceives as its domain since the fading of British and French influence in the oil-rich region has its many, violent at times, implications. But there were also many wasted opportunities that could have assured both the US and Iran that mutual respect and cooperation were a possibility worth exploring.

Former Iranian President Mohammed Khatami (in office 1997-2005) was a reformist, and he too was seen as 'different'. In fact, he did try to reach out to the US, but aside from a few symbolic gestures involving both parties, to no avail. The balances of power were extremely skewed in favor of the US, and politicians with sinister ambitions understood well the danger of reciprocal diplomacy with Iran.

The Obama administration is not particularly keen on peace for its sake, but is realistic enough to understand that the balances of power are constantly shifting. If the US continues with intractable attitude, it will leave the space open for its opponents to gain ground, and could find itself mired in new conflicts with dangerous consequences. Russia, whose political lot in the Middle East has grown to an unprecedented extent, delivered a masterful stroke when it capitalized on US Secretary of State John Kerry's apparent gaffe regarding Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. On Sep 14, Moscow's proposal to avert war, turned into an agreement, and in record time the mood had completely shifted from one geared towards an imminent war, to one with ample possibilities.

Of course, while the current civil war is tearing Syria to shreds, Iran and its allies as well as its enemies - have been key players in the conflict. Now that an agreement has been reached regarding Syria, Tom Curry, a National Affairs Writer with NBC News reported that Obama is hoping the Syria agreement ""could point the way to a diplomatic solution to the problem of Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions.""

Preparing for all possibilities, Rouhani began a quest to fortify his country's own alliances. In the recent 13th Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Kyrgyzstan, Rouhani showed willingness to resolve problems surrounding its perceived nuclear weapons ambition. Empowered by the dissipating chances of war against Syria, and Russia's growing fortunes as a diplomatic arbitrator, Iran sees an opportunity for a dignified solution.

Evidently, Israel and its Washington allies are not happy. To offset a backlash, Kerry selected Israel as his first destination after the signing of the Syria chemical weapons agreement on Sep. 14. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had warned that Rouhani was no different than his predecessor, must now find a way to restate his country's relevance, and will continue to find ways to push for war. Republican Senator John McCain's tireless advocacy for military action is not bearing fruits. His song 'bomb, bomb, bomb Iran' couldn't even deliver a limited strike against Syria. Pro-Israel lawmakers such as Ted Deutch and Peter Roskam are merely urging their government to double its efforts to prevent Russia's arming of Iran with advanced S-300 air defense systems.

Too little too late. Russia knows well that any turning back on its Iranian ally will not bode well for its longer term interests in the region. Andrei Arashev of the leading Russian think tank Strategic Culture Foundation is calling for ""strategic alliance"" with Iran, a sentiment echoed elsewhere. To achieve that alliance, but also to ease tensions with Washington, the Russian Kommersant reported that Moscow might offer Antey-2500, an alternative air defense system with equal efficiency. But there is more as ""Russia is ready to execute the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project, ignoring the US sanctions on Iran,"" reported Pakistan's The New International on Sep. 19, citing a Russian minister's comments in a meeting with Pakistan's petroleum minister in Islamabad.

It really matters little whether Obama is a true pen pal or not, the same way that his oratory skills have long been disregarded as extraneous. The issue here has much to do with the political landscape in the Middle East, the failed attempt at war in Syria and Iran's own alliances, starting with Russia. Obama's alleged morally-driven expectations from Iran's leaders and his supposed need for a trustworthy Iranian pen pal is all but mere fiction promoted by The New York Times. This strange logic begins and ends there.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/588578744535885/?type=3,2013-09-25 15:14:07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_584721794921580,"Many US media commentators were fairly accurate in labeling some of the language used by Russian President Vladimir Putin in a New York Times article as ""hypocritical"". 

But mainstream US media should be the last to point out anyone's hypocrisy as it has brazenly endorsed every military intervention unleashed by their country since World War II.

Putin's statement ""we must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement,"" merits serious scrutiny. Considering that violence has been a readily available option in Russia's own wars from Afghanistan, to Chechnya and Georgia, the language of dialogue and civilized political settlements have been rarely exercised.

However, independent from that context, Putin was surely correct in his assessment of US behavior. It was indeed difficult to point out any palpable inaccuracy in Putin's NYT's article published on the 12th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

""It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States,"" Putin wrote. ""Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan 'you're either with us or against us."" (Interestingly, this was the same conclusion reached by the China Daily in its editorial the next day.)

Putin's statement was not just true, but precise, highlighting the very essence that has defined US foreign policy since the end of the US-Soviet Cold War, and the US-led military campaign against Iraq in 1990-91. The model of ""cobbling coalitions together"" was used then as the US emerged as the lone superpower. This allowed it the space to reconfigure the world's geopolitical scene in any way it deemed necessary and suitable to its own, but also Israeli interests. It had done so repeatedly and with little hesitation. Its invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the pinnacle of that model. Millions of people were left dead and maimed while millions more were forced to franticly run for their lives.

The US-invited horror was hardly mentioned when Western ""liberal"" commentators cleverly called attention to all of Putin's and Russia's perceived failures. Simon Tisdall tried to take Putin to task on his piece in the British Guardian on September 12 by offering readers selected ""translations"" of the Russian president's text.

Using an intellectually demeaning approach of ""translating"" what could be obviously understood by any average reader of world affairs, Tisdall even contended with Putin's statement that ""it is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation … We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal"".

""Translation: this passage takes the biscuit for sheer chutzpah,"" Tisdall wrote. But what is Tisdall's view on the very ""sheer chutzpah"" of invoking American exceptionalism at every turn by the US' own leaders - from warmongers like George W Bush to Nobel Peace Prize winners like Barack Obama. Hasn't American exceptionalism cost the world so dearly? A lethal assortment of shocks and awes and unmanned drone warfare is all being sold in the name of human rights, democracy, and of course, in the name of God.

Putin is not exactly a peacenik, but his country has indeed succeeded in breaking, at least for now, a predictable pattern of American military interventions in the Middle East which are mostly aimed at ensuring Israel's military and political supremacy and suppressing its foes or potential enemies. This is in addition to safeguarding US energy supplies and keeping economic contenders at bay.

For this reason it was of little surprise that the first country that US Secretary of State John Kerry planned to visit following his talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on September 14, was Israel. Kerry and Lavrov met to discuss, and later agreed to the details of the dismantling of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, which was understood as the only viable way to avert a US military strike.

The proposal was fully Russian, hence Putin's public relations campaign, and his New York Times article. The US, alienated after years of warmongering, had to accept the Russian proposal. Any other option would have had unpredictable, but likely catastrophic outcomes.

Tellingly, Kerry opted for a meeting to debrief Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before conversing with his European Union allies. Of course, Israel will now try to influence the pursuit of Syria's chemical arsenal the same way the US and its Western allies manipulated the UN inspectors' work to dismantle Iraq's non-existent nuclear weapons program.

It must have been a major disappointment for Israel's neo-conservative friends and lobbies in the US that neither war nor ""surgical strikes"" are in the offing. It goes without saying that the lives of 100,000 Syrians or the plight of six million refugees are not a factor in their discontent. Middle East expert and author Jeremy Salt had a lot to say about the ""carefully crafted (and) deceitful campaign,"" unleashed by the Israeli lobby.

In ""Israel's Lobbyists Pushing Hard for another War in the Middle East,"" and after a careful examination of their public statements, Salt explains the new approach used by the Israel lobby, which carefully avoided any reference to Israeli interests. The major point of the campaign is that this war is ""not about Israel (but) about America's national interest (and) about punishing a government which has used chemical weapons on its own people"".

Israel has killed too many Arabs to worry about the death of some more, and the brutality of the Syrian government or its opposition has never been a concern to Israel and its lobby. For them, another American war is yet another opportunity to knock down an old adversary, engender further chaos and bask in the glory of being ""the only democracy in the Middle East"" among a sea of tumultuous, unruly neighbors. However, lack of appetite for intervention has thwarted the plan for now, leaving the US and Israel searching for new options to maintain their relevance in a region of quickly shifting balances.

The anger directed at Putin's article has a lot less to do with Putin's own legacy as a leader, and much more to do with the frustration that new players in the Middle East are now successfully involved in a ""game"" that has for decades been dominated by if not reserved for Western powers and their allies.

109808052412959_581665481893878,"It was 12 years ago Wednesday. Historians will register that, according to the official narrative, 19 Arabs armed with box cutters and minimal flying skills pledged to a transnational Terror Inc turned jets into missiles to attack the US homeland, fooling the most elaborate defense system on Earth.

Fast forward to 2013. Here's a 15-second version of the President of the United States (POTUS) address on Syria, one day before the 12th anniversary of 9/11:

""Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake. The United States is ""the anchor of global security.""

""Although the United States military ""doesn't do pin pricks"", we still carry the burden to punish regimes that would flout long-held conventions banning the use of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. That's why I have decided to pursue an unlimited, targeted military strike against Washington DC."" 

For countless global citizens, this alternative version predictably sounds as far-fetched as the official version of what happened 12 years ago. The fog of war obscures in mysterious ways. But the fact remains that the current, ""reluctant"" (farcical) Emperor continues to stake his - and his nation's - ""credibility"" on a ""limited"", ""kinetic"" operation to reinforce his self-defined red line against chemical weapons.

In theory, the Russian plan of having Damascus surrender its chemical weapons arsenal works because of its inbuilt Chinese wisdom; nobody loses face - from Obama and the US Congress to the European Union, the UN and the even more farcical, the ""Arab"" League, which is essentially a Saudi Arabian colony.

Although Obama is on a media blitzkrieg stealing the credit for it, Asia Times Online has confirmed that the plan was elaborated by Damascus, Tehran and Moscow last week - after a visit to Damascus by the head of the national security committee of the Iranian Majlis (parliament), Alaeddin Boroujerdi. US Secretary of State John Kerry's now famous ""slip"" provided the opening.

So, essentially, it's this ""axis"" - Damascus, Tehran and Moscow - that is helping Obama to crawl out of his self-inflicted abyss. Needless to say, that is absolutely unbearable for the plutocrats in charge of unleashing the new Syria (lethal) production. A brand new propaganda/manufactured hysteria campaign must be unfurled to justify war. And that's exactly what the Anglo-French-American axis is working on.

No wonder the French proposal for a new UN Security Council resolution falls under the UN's Chapter 7 - which would explicitly allow the use of force against Damascus in case of non-compliance. As it is, this resolution will inevitably be vetoed by Russia and China. And that will be the new pretext for war. The (farcical) emperor may easily invoke plausible deniability, stress he made ""every effort"" to avoid a military conflict, and then convince skeptics in the US Congress this is the only way to go.

And to think that a perfectly sound development of the Damascus-Tehran-Moscow plan is at hand. Syria's chemical weapons may be transferred to Russian - or European - supervision. Syria joins the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and ratifies the Chemical Weapon Convention (CWC). OPCW inspectors start working in coordination with the UN. Every expert knows the whole process will take years.

Damascus has already declared it's ready to join the OPCW and abide by the CWC. So Damascus does not need a UN Security Council resolution forcing it to do what it wants to do. Any serious, comprehensive UN resolution on chemical weapons across the Middle East would have to include Israel's chemical weapons. Note that nobody, absolutely nobody, is talking about Israel's vast arsenal of chemical, not to mention nuclear weapons.

The sound path, though, will not be followed - because Washington and its barking poodles afflicted with Sykes-Picot wet dreams, London and Paris, are already blocking it.

There are no signs that the Obama administration is prepared to even reconsider the yo-yo ""Obama doctrine"" all across the Middle East. This would imply dumping the Saudi-Israeli axis and making a concerted effort for the success of the Geneva II conference, the only possible diplomatic solution for the Syrian tragedy.

I have argued before that the (farcical) emperor is just a paperboy - a docile employee. Those who are paying for the upcoming lethal production, as in the House of Saud, or cheering in the sidelines, as in the Israel lobby, simply won't give up.

The House of Saud wants regime change, now. The Israel lobby/AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and its masters in Tel Aviv want a massive spillover of the Syria war into Lebanon to entangle Hezbollah. Financial Masters of the Universe, significant sectors of the industrial-military-security Orwellian/Panopticon complex, and Western-propped petro-monarchies want an independent, secular Arab republic profitably integrated in their monopoly.

The problem is the unilateral ""kinetic"" whatever may be too ""limited"" to satisfy the Saudi-Israeli axis and most of all the financial Masters of the Universe, and illegal enough to qualify as a war crime.

At least there is a counter-power. Asia Times Online has confirmed that an outstanding meeting will take place later this week in Kyrgyzstan, during the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Picture Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani together, in the same room, discussing their common position on Syria. Iran is an SCO observer - and may soon be admitted as a full member. This is what the Anglo-French-American axis is up against.

And that brings us back to 12 years ago - and the myth that aluminum jets are able to penetrate the thick steel perimeters of the Twin Towers and kerosene is capable of instantaneously melting steel perimeters and steel cores into fluffy steel dust. Check this out and draw the necessary conclusions.

As for that ""evil"", transnational Terror Inc, it didn't even have a name when Jihad International hopefuls were being recruited in the early 1980s by assorted Islamic charities, and then trained and funded by the CIA and Saudi Arabia. One day the database was finally named - by the US - as ""al-Qaeda"". Or, more appropriately, ""al-CIAeda"". They were elevated to Ultimate Evil status. They did 9/11. They reproduced like rabbits from Mali to Indonesia. Now the CIA works side-by-side with them - as it did in Libya. And eagerly they await the US Air Force to clear their road to Damascus. Hey, it's just (war) business. Allahu Akbar.

109808052412959_579753582085068,"Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has conceded defeat after the Federal Elections on Saturday which have resulted in the Opposition Liberal and National Party Coalition winning a comfortable majority.

Tony Abbott, who will now become prime minister, thanked Rudd for his service. The Australian Labor Party, with Rudd at the helm, swept into power in 2007. ""Australia is under new management, and we are now open for business,"" he told an enthusiastic crown of supporters as he claimed victory at Sydney's NLP headquarters, the Four Seasons Hotel.

At the start of the campaign the two parties were running neck-and-neck but with Abbott's party expected to win narrowly. The polls however were bobbing up and down, buoyed by the return of Rudd to the ALP leadership after being ousted by Julia Gillard in 2010.

While the 2013 campaign has been dominated by concerns about the economy, asylum seekers and climate change, the real difference was the unprecedented support by Rupert Murdoch's newspapers which represent two thirds of newspapers sold in Australia. Murdoch had been running negative stories about the ALP and its two leaders, Gillard and Rudd, for five years. The campaign was beefed up just prior to the election being called and thereafter it went into overdrive bombarding the ALP with negative headlines, stories, editorials, and characterisations of Rudd as a psychopath, in Nazi dress, and as a bumbling, incompetent with serious personality issues.

Rudd's popularity and that of the ALP plunged.

With voting in Australia being compulsory more than 14 million people were estimated to have votet. News polls predicted a wipeout for Rudd and the ALP, particularly in Rudd's home state of Queensland. News Corp newspapers even predicted Rudd would lose his seat, as would Treasurer Chris Bowen. Not only were those predictions wrong, the ALP retained every seat it had in Queensland, every seat held by Cabinet members, and every seat held by the ALP executive.

Nonetheless the defeat was profound and the party will have to rebuild. To put the Gillard Rudd era behind it and provide a fresh start Rudd has announced he will not recontest the leadership.

Abbott has served in the Howard ministry and will have a competent team behind him as he takes over when the Governor General swears him and his ministry in, in about a week's time. The first order of business will be the abolition of the unpopular Carbon Tax. A dismantling and rejigging of the popular NBN (National Broadband Network) will be next on the agenda.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/579753582085068/?type=3,2013-09-07 08:59:44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_579262398800853,"Israel has come out into the open to lend its weight to Barack Obama's plan to attack Syria.

Israel wants the U.S. president to act but not decisively. The Jewish state is happy to see the turmoil continue despite the slaughtering of innocent civilians as it weakens a traditional enemy of Israel. Similarly events in Egypt, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon appear to be amenable to Israel. 

A New York Times article this week says Israelis have increasingly argued that the best outcome for Syria's two-and-a-half-year-old civil war, at least for the moment, is no outcome.

""For Jerusalem, the status quo, horrific as it may be from a humanitarian perspective, seems preferable to either a victory by Mr. Assad's government and his Iranian backers or a strengthening of rebel groups, increasingly dominated by Sunni jihadis,"" the Times article said.

""This is a playoff situation in which you need both teams to lose, but at least you don't want one to win — we'll settle for a tie,"" Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York (pictured), was quoted by The New York Times as saying. ""Let them both bleed, hemorrhage to death: that's the strategic thinking here. As long as this lingers, there's no real threat from Syria.""

Israel's national security concerns have broad, bipartisan support in Washington, and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the influential pro-Israel lobby in Washington, weighed in Tuesday in support of Mr. Obama's approach. The group's statement said nothing, however, about the preferred outcome of the civil war, said the Times report. 

In fact to the contrary, the AIPAC statement made much of the suffering of civilians to justify its support for limited U.S. air strikes. ""The civilized world cannot tolerate the use of these barbaric weapons, particularly against an innocent civilian population including hundreds of children,"" the AIPAC statement said. ""Simply put, barbarism on a mass scale must not be given a free pass.""

The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations also endorsed U.S. air strikes but more as a punishment rather than to curtail the violence. ""Those who perpetuate such acts of wanton murder must know that they can not do so with impunity,"" a statement from the conference said. 

Matthew Levitt, who studies the region at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told The New York Times Jerusalem and Washington essentially agree that ""right now, there's no good way for this war to end.""

Israeli leaders ""want Assad to be punished; they'd like it to be punishing enough that it actually makes a difference in the war but not so much that it completely takes him out,"" Mr. Levitt said. ""The Israelis do not think the status quo is tenable either, but they think the status quo right now is better than the war ending tomorrow, because the war ending tomorrow could be much worse. There's got to be a tomorrow, day-after plan.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/579262398800853/?type=3,2013-09-06 08:15:05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On September 6 last year Packer's Crown Limited lodged an Unsolicited Proposal with Barry O'Farrell's NSW State Government seeking approval to establish a casino and hotel at Sydney's Barangaroo which would cost $1 billion. 

On September 5 last year, the day before the Unsolicited Proposal was lodged and became public, Crown's shares were trading at $8.79. Shares of Echo Entertainment, the operator of Sydney's casino, Star Casino, which would lose its exclusivity if Packer's proposal was successful, were trading at $4.05.

O'Farrell's government has all but obliged the Packer camp with a process that has fast-tracked without tender the application which is now in its final stage of approval.

It has been a whirlwind run for Packer with the securing of a license all but certain. Crown's share have soared in the past year. The day before the Unsolicited Proposal was announced the groups' shares traded at $8.79. On Friday they closed at $15, an increase of more than 70%.

109808052412959_579100862150340,"The assassination of Australia's Labor government by the Murdoch press is probably the slowest demolition on record. 

It has taken more than five years, and began within a year of some, not all, Murdoch newspapers endorsing the Labor Opposition in 2007.

The Australian's support of Kevin Rudd's ALP came the day before the 2007 election, in an editorial published November 23 of that year.

By 2008 the knives were out. They were sharpened in 2009 and by 2010 the polls were so bad for Rudd he was removed from the leadership. Murdoch was half-way there. Next came the job on Julia Gillard. It took much longer but the tenacity of the News Corp papers blasted Gillard's reputation to tatters, so much so that a hate frenzy against Gillard by the public soon emerged, the ferocity of which has not been since that waged against Lindy Chamberlain, which too was orchestrated by the Australian media.
 
Two of News Corporation's major daily newspapers, The Daily Telegraph The Courier Mail, as well as The Australian backed Rudd the day before the 2007 election. The Herald Sun and The Advertiser endorsed John Howard's Coalition.

The Australian, Rupert Murdoch's national newspaper had long been considered a cheerleader of the Howard government, as indeed it was. It backed a Labor government in 1972 again when a Labor victory looked inevitable. Within 3 years however Murdoch had disowned Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and worked tirelessly for Malcolm Fraser's Liberal-National Party Coalition. As with the current campaign, The Australian's headlines, and stories were manipulated to bias the LNP, so much so that all 109 journalists with The Australian went on strike.
 
In 2007 the tables were turned, albeit the day before the election. ""Mr Rudd has offered himself as a man of the future,"" said the editorial in The Australian. ""Mandarin-speaking and married to a very successful businesswoman, Mr Rudd has campaigned to help take Australia into the 21st century, offering to provide the infrastructure and tools to complete the transition into the digital age.""

""To boost his credentials as a candidate for the future, Mr Rudd has made building a high-speed broadband network and the provision of a computer to all senior high school students a centrepiece of his campaign. On climate change, Mr Rudd has promised the largely symbolic gesture of ratifying the Kyoto protocol but mirrored the Government's core position that any post-Kyoto agreement must include China and India. He has promised a carrot-and-stick approach to forcing state governments to improve health services or lose responsibility for them and a razor gang to cut the fat from what he says is a bloated public service.""

""The Australian is particularly interested in Mr Rudd's desire to modernise the federation, something for which we have long campaigned,"" editorialised the Murdoch-owned newspaper. "" Mr Rudd claims his background as a senior public servant with the Goss government in Queensland and the network of state Labor administrations will be an advantage to his reform plans.""
""If he wins, Mr Rudd must deal with the high expectations of the union movement. This remains our biggest reservation about the possibility of a Labor government,"" said The Australian. ""Mr Rudd says unions will get no special treatment from him and we would expect him to honour his word. More than anything, we would wish Mr Rudd to be a true reformer for Labor in the mould of former British prime minister Tony Blair. On balance, we think the introduction of a fairness test has weakened the reform credentials of Mr Howard's Work Choices package, which was designed to keep pressure off wages and improve workplace flexibility. On the other side, Mr Rudd has successfully moved his party towards the centre on IR, agreeing to keep individual contracts for high-paid workers and limit the influence of unions. The big difference is Labor's plan to return unfair dismissal laws for small business, which could have a negative impact on employment growth.""

""While we are mindful of the economic dangers posed by a resurgent trade union movement, we do not believe Mr Rudd poses an obvious threat to Australia's financial wellbeing. We are encouraged by his determination to pick his own cabinet.""

""Mr Rudd's attention to process, including a determination to push ahead with plans to improve the living conditions of indigenous Australians, is impressive. So too is his pledge to make sure his ministers and bureaucrats keep in touch by meeting regularly outside of Canberra,"" said The Australian.

""The truth is we are not so interested in one side of politics or the other. We advocate a set of principles that have motivated us for 40 years: an open economy, markets, international engagement, reform of the federation and labour market deregulation. With the caveat of industrial relations, Mr Rudd shares many of our reform ideals. We believe it is a new century and that Australia deserves a leader who reflects Australia's character and position in a rapidly changing world and fast-growing region.""
As Australia's economic centre of gravity shifts north to reflect the mining boom and the rise of Asia, it is fitting that the new Labor leader comes from Queensland, editorialised The Murdoch-owned newspaper. ""We believe this is a great advantage. ALP leaders from Queensland and Western Australia, more than the southeast of the nation, are attuned to the concerns and aspirations of middle Australia. We believe the incumbent Government has been a good manager but has not done much with the prosperity with which the nation has been blessed during its watch.""
 ""We recognise that no change is free of risk, but we recommend a vote for Mr Rudd.""

Flash forward to 2013. The Murdoch press is rooting for Rudd's opponent Tony Abbott. ""He has identified his own weaknesses and sought to eliminate them; he has reached out to working women, for example, like no political leader in recent history. The Sunday Telegraph believes Mr Abbott is ready to lead Australia,"" said News Corp's flagship Sunday newspaper.
 
""It is a job Mr Abbott has wanted for much of his life. He has dedicated himself to the fight, shaping a philosophy of government that is both economically conservative and socially responsible,"" said the Murdoch-owned newspaper. ""Mr Abbott has also demonstrated himself to be a decisive and compassionate leader. Despite the relentless and often deeply unfair goading of his detractors, Mr Abbott has avoided the street-fight and embraced a calm appeal to Australians' better judgment. He has committed himself to finding solutions for some of our most seemingly intractable problems, from indigenous disadvantage to business stagnation and labour productivity.""

""It seems an understatement to observe that the Labor-led government of the past six years has been a grave disappointment. Labor's fragile grip on parliamentary majority has created a shambolic, often comically inept administration that routinely undermines its own achievements and credibility,"" said the Murdoch press of the government it so enthusiastically supported in 2007.

""Much has been written lately about media coverage of the Rudd government - but let's cut through the spin,"" said The Sunday Telegraph editorial.

""This isn't about party politics. It is about bad government. And this is a bad government. For much of the past six years, Labor has been its own opposition. It has been a crying shame to witness the waste of ideas, the triumph of shallow self-interest over sense, and the contemptuous disregard for the great privilege of being granted power by the Australian public.""
""It started with squandering the surplus on ineptly administered ""stimulus'' measures during the GFC. It got worse with the bizarre, back-of-the-envelope mining ""super-profits'' tax that Labor expected resource companies to simply accept,"" said the editorial.

""In 2010 the panicked execution of Kevin Rudd brought to a national stage the worst of NSW Labor's obscene obsession with power and delivered us a leader in Julia Gillard who was beholden to cheap factional alliances instead of the national good. The revelations that were to follow during ICAC hearings about the corrupt practices of NSW Labor further eroded the confidence of voters in this state.""

""After the 2010 election, the introduction of a carbon tax with no mandate, the cheap deals with crossbenchers, the ham-fisted attempts at media regulation and the botched reintroduction of offshore processing compounded the Government's sins,"" said the Murdoch newspaper.

To put a nail in the coffin of the Labor party's chances at the election next Saturday, the widely circulated newspaper adds: ""Another three years of Labor would be an unmitigated disaster.""
The Sunday Telegraph in crafting its editorial to promote its endorsement of Tony Abbott in fact spends its entire piece attacking Rudd. It does however in conclusion talk of Mr Abbott's awaiting destiny, and adds some words of wisdom on the Sunday Telegraph's ""critical voice for our readers.""
 
 ""But declaring ""this is a bad government"" is not enough,"" the editorial reads. ""Poor performance by one side is not enough for us to endorse the entrusting of Australia's future to a new force, unless the opposition and its leader have demonstrated themselves capable, competent and ready to lead.""

""Tony Abbott and the Coalition have done that. Mr Abbott's destiny awaits. And, as always, The Sunday Telegraph will be here as a critical voice for our readers. We are not, and have never been, cheerleaders for any one side of politics. We have consistently railed against incompetence.""
""We will continue to advocate for the public interest, to hold governments to their promises and to do everything we can to protect and promote an Australia blessed with free thinking, free markets and free people.""

Murdoch's Melbourne newspaper The Herald Sun, said, ""Australia cannot afford to keep the most dysfunctional and inept government in its history"" It said Mr. Abbott ""will be an outstanding prime minister.""

Without doubt Tony Abbott will indeed take over as prime minister. Will he be doing any favors for the Murdoch press in response to the unprecedented support he has enjoyed?

""Absolutely not, absolutely not,"" he told ABC TV's 730 on Monday.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/579100862150340/?type=3,2013-09-05 21:23:39,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_578864365507323,"The Australian Liberal-National Party Coalition has released the remainder of its costings, one-and-a-half days before the Federal election, outlining a plan to fund an A$11.5 billion infrastructure package by cutting foreign aid growth by $4.5 billion.

The fiscal budget impact of coalition policies, signed off by the Independent Costings Review panellists, Geoff Carmody, Len Scanlon and Peter Shergold, says it has an additional A$9 billion in savings that will improve the budget line by A$6 billion over the four years and reduce government debt by A$16 billion.

As expected, the Coalition will cut the public service by 12,000 through natural attrition to save $5.2 billion. It has already previously outlined savings by abolishing the carbon tax and mining tax that will help pay for its $9.8 billion paid parental leave scheme.

In the costings released Thursday, the Coalition pledged to increase its proportion of joint road funding to 80%, with a 20% contribution from the states, up from its current rate of 50/50 and outlined a list of significant road and rail projects.

The Conversation called on its experts to respond:

Fabrizio Carmignani, Associate Professor, Griffith Business School at Griffith University:

After announcing $31 billion in savings earlier in the campaign, the Coalition on Thursday announced a further $9 billion saving package. According to shadow treasurer Joe Hockey, the fiscal plan of the Coalition will lead to an improvement of $6 billion in the budget balance and a reduction of $16 billion in Australian debt. Hockey also announced a significant boost to investment in infrastructure development, while stating that there will be no cuts to education and health.

There are two considerations that I believe are relevant. First, the announcement of today seems to confirm that the Coalition disregard cyclical fluctuations in designing its fiscal policy. This is a mistake in view of the fact that fiscal policy multipliers in Australia are significant. Fiscal policy should be run counter-cyclically, as the Labor governments have done.

I expected some sort of acknowledgement of this basic principle, but instead Hockey seems to be more concerned about balancing the budget, as if a balanced budget were in itself an objective of fiscal policy. Hockey spoke about a ""budget crisis"", therefore implying that the increase in deficit observed since 2008 is intrinsically bad. As I have written previously, I think that this interpretation of what constitutes good fiscal policy is plain wrong.

It was instead a good thing for Australia that the Labor government used the budget to sustain the economy at a time of global crisis. If the deficit had not increased in the aftermath of the GFC, Australia would have not avoided the recession. Conversely, the increase in deficit helped avoid the recession and maintain a positive rate of employment growth. In other words, the deficit was a sign of good fiscal policy.

Second, among the various measures announced Thursday, one that particularly stands out is the $4.5 billion cut in the growth of foreign aid. It will be embarrassing, to say the least, for Tony Abbott  if elected prime minister  to chair the G20 next year after having won the election with a platform that has in cuts to foreign aid one of its key points.

John Quiggin, Professor, School of Economics at University of Queensland

It's unsurprising that the Coalition costings have been concealed until the last possible moment. It would not stand to more than a day or two of scrutiny, but it doesn't have to. Among the obvious problems are the failure to cost key policies, the effective abandonment of the 5% emissions reduction target and bogus assumptions about an economic dividend from the removal of the carbon price. The endorsement of this deeply flawed process by Peter Shergold, Geoff Carmody and Len Scanlan is a disgrace.

Roy Green, Dean of UTS Business School at [University of Technology, Sydney

The release of the Coalition's final tranche of policy costings and commitments will provide grounds for cautious optimism on the part of those with an interest in the development of Australia's innovation system and innovative businesses. While there are spending reductions for the Automotive Transformation Plan, Manufacturing Technology Innovation Centre and ICT Centre of Excellence, and a ""reprioritising"" of Australian Research Council funding, there are also further, albeit more modest, commitments to the expansion of Export Marketing Development grants and a Manufacturing Transition program. There are also increases planned for Rural RD Corporations, understandably given the National Party's priorities, and it is to be hoped that these increases are for genuine RD rather than marketing and consultancies.

Most importantly, it would appear that the major innovation and business improvement programs have been spared major reductions, though of course there may be some reconfiguration of these programs and they may have fewer staff to run them. The programs to survive at this stage, unless we hear to the contrary, include Enterprise Connect, Commercialisation Australia and the newly announced Innovation Partnerships.

For the last, it may be a stay of execution until the Commission of Audit as shadow minister Sophie Mirabella has indicated an intention to scrap the partnerships as they are currently constituted. Needless to say, anything to do with a clean energy future has gone the way of the carbon tax, subject of course to the balance of power in the Senate.

There are inevitably mixed views in the Coalition about the efficacy of innovation programs, but it may be that significant industry commitment and momentum, reflecting the demonstrated success of these programs, will ensure their continuity. This would be good news for the growth and transformation of businesses across Australia, for their workforces and for the economy as a whole, and augurs well for a more bipartisan approach to these critical policy areas. The Coalition will have cause to be grateful to the Labor government for taking some of the hard decisions for them, in particular the cuts to funding for higher education and research infrastructure.

Sinclair Davidson, Professor of Institutional Economics at RMIT University

The long-awaited Coalition costings were released Thursday afternoon  one and a half days before election day. Apparently in previous elections the ALP had released their costings at 5pm on election eve  so somehow that condones the Coalition being tardy.

That really sums up the whole ""costings"" exercise  everyone gets to play ""gotcha"" and silly-buggers and avoids the important questions. The really important question is whether it all really matters that much? How much detail do we really need? I suspect not much.

What voters do need to know is whether the entire package of promises are financially plausible  not whether each and every cent of spending is accounted for. We know full well that the government's plans are going to change depending on the composition of parliament after Saturday (and especially after July next year) and as economic circumstances change. That is true irrespective of whoever wins government.

For example, we know that the Palmer United Party does not have a financially plausible package  it is promising massive tax cuts while also promising massive spending increases.

So the test to my mind is whether the numbers are broadly consistent with the story. More or less, the answer is ""yes"".

The model the Coalition used this in election of having an Independent Costings Review Panel is a good idea and ensures that the public can have confidence that some serious scrutiny has occurred. That is probably the best that can be done from opposition and I suspect the ALP will adopt that model when they are next in opposition.

In short, given the limitations of opposition the Coalition have done as best they can, and the best that can be reasonably expected on the process.

Within the process, however, there are still policy choices that can be discerned and criticised.

The Coalition had already announced that the carbon tax and the mining tax would go and some of the associated expenditure would be cut as well. That is sensible, but that does raise the question why all the associated expenditure wasn't cut.

What is new is that the rate of growth in foreign aid expenditure would be cut. So foreign aid isn't being cut per se or even frozen. This will cause some consternation; but I suspect most Australians would be somewhat indifferent to this reduction in proposed expenditure.

I've also seen some discussion about reducing waste  especially around ARC research grants. Joe Hockey was asked about this repeatedly in his press conference. This will cause howls of outrage from the university community  but it is only $103 million over four years. This is an argument the universities can't win  there are elements within Treasury and the Department of Finance who would want make deeper cuts into the ARC.

Then there is lazy policy  another efficiency dividend (directed at the public service). I am not a fan of efficiency dividends  what ends up happening is that fewer people do more work. What needs to happen is that specific functions and activities should be targeted and discontinued. The notion of efficiency dividend assumes that good government can be delivered on the cheap.

This latest efficiency dividend relates to a reduction of government advertising. Yes  we've heard this one before. The Coalition proposes to cut $220 million in 2016/17 just in time for the next election. No, I don't believe it either.

Then are the things that a Coalition government will do that should be undertaken by state government, or even local councils. Drowning is a terrible thing  but I'm not sure the Commonwealth should be spending $10 million on it. $20 million for a marriage voucher trial? Really?

The biggest problem with the costings, to my mind, is the $1 million set aside for the National Commission of Audit. This is the promised audit of all government spending that the Coalition have promised will be established to do a thorough analysis of all government spending. They are just not serious if all that is being budgeted is $1 million. The Henry Tax Review had a budget of $10 million.

To my mind the National Commission of Audit is one of the most important initiatives the Coalition has proposed  they will need to spend much more than $1 million to get it done.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/578864365507323/?type=3,2013-09-05 09:30:47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_578231745570585,"An editorial in Rupert Murdoch's widely circulated The Sunday Telegraph newspaper has been attacked by its readers. 
 
The editorial followed a general theme seen throughout the election campaign, and in the years leading up to it. On day one of the campaign The Daily Telegraph's front page was dedicated to an editorial titled 'Kick this mob out.' Sitting Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has been derided, portrayed as a Nazi, a psychopath, and an incompetent that has been running a ""dysfunctional"" government. The extensive negative coverage by the Murdoch media has seen a dramatic swing in the polls against Rudd's government, one that will see him hurled from power on Saturday.

""Terrible editorial. How dare you tell us who we should vote for. Give us the facts and leave it at that,"" wrote Hayden Johnson in a comment on The Sunday Telegraph website.

""Another article from the order of Rupert Murdoch,"" David C wrote. ""Your paper is an absolute disgrace and it's best use is not to read it but to wrap up fish and chips with it. I love how you try and make yourself sound impartial- claiming you backed Labor in 2007. It was probably on the last day where a Labor win was a forgone conclusion. The truth is news limited were very damaging to Labor during the mining tax row. The Australian ran 13 out of 14 front pages in the space of two weeks- most of the coverage negative towards Labor. I would describe news-limited like a bully that is undermining our democracy. Who has the abused their power with their right wing inflammatory propaganda. I find it astounding that Murdoch who has not live in our country for 20 years and yet he can choose our government from his porch at his winery in California by a simple phone call.""

""This reminds me why I so willingly left the ranks of ""journalism"" . A disgusting piece of dribble which reads like a press release,"" posted AJT of the Sydney suburb of Parramatta. ""…. Want to be a voice for your readers? How sweet. Except, that's never been a media products job. You should be providing balanced, fair and complete information so people can make informed choices. I'm sickened to my stomach by this embarrassment to the industry.""

Patrick of Sydney suburb Ryde wrote, ""In my opinion for the sake of Australia Tony Abbott should never be Prime Minister as he is simply not up to the job which now Australia will need to find out the hard way.""

""Tony Abbott and the Coalition have done have demonstrated themselves capable, competent and ready to lead"" - sure, I'll believe it just because you said so!"" JB posted.

Robert Martin of Selby described the Telegraph's actions as shameful. ""The actions of the Daily Telegraph, not just in the election campaign but over the past 3 years stands condemn it as a hysterical partisan broadsheet,"" he said. ""We are not, and never have been, cheerleaders for any one side of politics"" is probably the most dishonest line I have ever read. Shame telegraph shame!""

""So glad to see the majority of comments are against your absurdly biased journalism. Regardless of who you vote for this is simply wrong,"" commented Jo Kiernan.
 
Karen of Morningside in Queensland penned, ""The Daily Telegraph really does set the standard in journalism. Responsible political journalism is about holding the relevant parties to account. Mr Rudd said on commercial television that it wasn't about ""negativity but accountability""...and this is exactly what the Telegraph is delivering.""

""I'm shocked that the Sunday Telegraph would support Tony Abbott. I did not see this coming at all. Not one iota,"" posted Jason Dean.

AJ commented, ""So you didn't even have the gall to put a name to this? Staff Writers indeed. The constant negativity towards a government that has done more for infrastructure in seven years than the combined Liberal governments of the past twenty is a disgrace. It's negativity matched only by a poisonous opposition. We certainly deserve the government we're about to get because the greater masses are brainwashed by the hatchet job performed by the Murdoch papers. For shame.""

""Your reporting has been an unmitigated disaster of such profound bias that thinking people feel embarrassed about it,"" said Tony Fitzsummons. ""Everything written has been one sided but this is no surprise as your close cousin Fox News US has called itself 'fair and balanced' for years. Your credibility as a newspaper that delivers news has been damaged beyond repair. It is completely shameful.""

Peterin Sydney of Sydney posted, ""Abbott will be the biggest disaster as Prime Minister the country has ever had. Australians will will regret their decisions very very soon.""

You have written wise words in this article. Abbott has ""grown"" over the past 7 years and I think Abbott will be a responsible, measured PM. Plus he will manage the economy very well. In a way, I must say, I really think we can trust Abbott to do what he says he will do and also feel he is a good family man with political integrity and boy do we need integrity and ethics back in Australian politics! Roll on September 7

Very Very Very well said. I just really hope that the average voters think the same and Mr Abbott is our next Prime Minister for the good of the country. The ALP is only interested in one thing: remaining in power for their own self interest and ego's. Tony Abbott, Julie Bishop and Joe Hockey will bring back a bit class to government, and we can all wake up in the morning and not worry about what disaster the government has caused the country over night.

If only our politicians would have the courage to embrace, trust and develop policy for an ""Australia blessed with free thinking, free markets and free people"", rather than seek out petty political point scoring, rampant self-interest and endless spin. Maybe then we would have a government that truly represented the great and noble people that collectively are proud to call themselves Australians.

I'm glad to see that you have acknowledged that your 2007 recommendation to vote for Labor was a mistake as many of your readers knew it was.

Your support of the Rudd led opposition in 2007 will go down in the annals of editorial idiocy ! The changing of government to the Rudd and Gillard led shambles will be seen as the largest weakening blow to this country in its history. It was change for change sake at its worst. At least in 2013 you have gone some distance in remedying that. My main concern though is that down the track of our political history there will NOT be a lesson learned and once again the VERY short memories of journalists and voters will mean that the ALP are once more put into government ...and once more the country will suffer. Hopefully I will have shuffled off this mortal coil by then!!!

I am appalled! And it terrifies and saddens me to think that the 'free thinking people of Australia' either need or want the absolute bias demonstrated here. This editorial pretends that opinions such as 'this is a bad government', are facts, and readers who do not think for themselves simply take this on and start parroting it as fact also. Advocating for the public interest? I do NOT want the Sunday Telegraph advocating for me - I would like to the retain the right to hear the FACTS and think for myself!

Great article - you nailed it. I'm glad you mentioned that in 2007 you endorsed Labor as it means Labor supporters can not cry foul.

I couldn't agree more, we need to vote Labor out & the Coalition in & Tony Abbott as PM. Labor, & Kevin Rudd have wasted Billions & Billions of tax payers money, they have mismanaged & are a incompetent Government. Now Rudd is desperate & spending money like if he is picking money off the trees?? We are in debt & paying a huge interest daily on our debt, it will be our children & their children having to pay the debt off. Labor has not put all their costings out, but goes on about the Coalition hasn't yet put their costing out, WHY hasn't Labor? Labor didn't until the last day before the last Election & that was at 5 pm. We heard how Rudd, Bowen & Penny Wong lied saying that Treasury & Finance had found the Coalition costings wrong & this was a shameless desperate act on the part of Labor, well done to the Treasury & Finance for saying this was NOT true, certainly proves we cannot trust Labor!

Well, I sincerely hope that this time next Sunday I will be sitting writing a congratulatory email to Mr Abbott and a 'good bye and good riddance' one to Rudd and every single one of his Labor sycophants, the shambles of a government that has brought Australia to where it is at this time. But, what an uphill battle the Liberals are about to start to get the ship back on an even keel and I can bet that right from the moment Rudd admits defeat, the ABC and all the true believers and of course, the elitists and the latte set will start their constant screeching at that terrible Mr Abbott and his Liberals. Sadly for them though, their bleating will just be music to many voter's ears.

•	Eddy of Western Sydney Posted at 9:37 AM September 01, 2013 
My vote may also reflect the poll result at the moment which gives 53-47 to the Lib. On that note, if I vote for the Lib, it is because Labor has performed a chaotic administration over the last six years, not only in policies but also in leadership and party's characteristics. So, my vote is not driven by the Lib has presented better policies over the campaign. It is because of Labor's problem that has led to incompetent administration. Having said that, I do expect the Coalition is really ready to manage the country, given they have experienced team members. Otherwise, we are going from one disappointment to another.

Congratulations for reaching the lowest possible point in journalistic history! The only good point is that at least you are not even bothering to hide your political bias. If you think that supporting an Abbott victory you are doing Australians a major service, think again. If Abbott wins and that, unfortunately, seems likely, millions of Australians will actually suffer. The unemployed, the aged, people on low incomes, health care, education and the environment will also suffer and go backwards. Electricity prices will not decrease. The people who will be 'rewarded' will be those people/ groups who supported the Coalition and their rewards will be a direct result of cut-backs to essential services. Maybe that is your idea of good government, but is not mine. Pray that I am wrong and that if Abbott wins and talks about governing for all Australians, that he actually means it, and remember these words if my prophecies come true!

Many believe 3 years of Abbott would be an unmitigated disaster. Who says you get to decide for Australia? What gives you the right to try and influence the vote? Who are you ""Staff writers""? You ignore people who disagree with you and manipulate public perception of policies (fast broadband was Rudd's idea, not Gillards as you claim). Will this comment even get published?

Australia simply cannot afford another three years of the present government. We'll be bankrupt and unrecognisable as a country by then. Something has to be done to put us back on track. Let's hope Mr. Abbott and his party are up for the task.

When are Labor going to learn basic maths? Reports are that Rudd will offer a tax write off ($3,000) for purchases up to $10,000 for the estimated 3.2 million small businesses with turnover of less than 2 million and will only cost $200 million over 4 years. My calculations are that if all the estimated 3.2 million small businesses took that up it would cost $9.6 Billion not a mere 200 million. 3,200,000 (3.2 million) x 10,000 = 32,000,000,000 (32 Billion) * 30% = $9.6 Billion What happens where there are more than one business owned by the same people operating out of the same address, are all those trading businesses entitled to that deduction and what would stop others from registering more businesses to claim it?

I have never NEVER in my 62 years, seen a more disgracefully biased reporting from a newspaper. I know that you guys are under orders by Rupert to print this garbage, but don't you guys feel the least bit of shame? I am not a Rudd fan or in fact a Labour supporter. But your daily biased and negative campaign against Rudd has convinced me to vote FOR Rudd. Your paper has disgraced itself in this campaign so much so that I have stopped buying the Telegraph. If this is the way you report the election, it certainly makes me wonder the accuracy of all the other articles you publish.

This editorial lacks sufficient substance to be taken with respect and credibility. To reason why someone should become the next PM as ""it is a job Mr Abbott has wanted for much of his life"" being the very first important point of the article sets the article up poorly beyond an immediate feeling of pure selfishness ... or exacerbating the electorates view that ""politicians are only out for themselves"". Editorials of this nature should be avoided, as you blindly place faith in an individual who is yet unproven for this role (even with a resume of an opposition leader or a minister in a by-gone previous government) does not provide ""the"" foundation for why they should be a PM - as previous history has reconciled. I would have preferred to read an editorial comparing why a Coalition party should be elected over a Labor party purely on assessment of policy that excludes the mention of a leader which as we have seen can be easily removed (from all parties). It is the party that we have to actually deal with, having to wait upto three years before we have the opportunity to keep em, or get rid of em. The leader to an effect, is only the product's used salesman.

In my understanding this is ILLEGAL! You didn't even have the foresight to label your front page with the words OPINION or EDITORIAL. I would be very surprised if Mr Murdoch doesn't cop it over this. There is already an ocean of backlash on social media. Do you think the Australian people are this stupid?

See all the rusted on Labor voters here demonstrating their own extreme bias - regardless of what conspiracy theory you have about Murdoch, the fact still remains whether is said by the Tele or the ABC or Fairfax - This government is a disaster and incompetent and divided. You can plainly see half the ministers are leaving rather than serve under Kevin and most do not participate in the campaign. You can plainly see Kevin Rudd losing it and the chaos and disfunction that follows him with policy on the run and his own campaign team have contempt for him. If this was the case in the Coalitions campaign where ministers were openly hostile and not willing to serve under Abbott you would never hear the end of it on every paper and news story in the country. The fact you people think a paper reporting these facts is wrong says more about your own bias than Murdochs.

'The Gillard government oversaw the smallest increase in cost of living of any Australian government for at least 25 years despite the introduction of the carbon tax, a new study has found. Moreover, Australian households have seen real incomes - disposable income minus cost of living increases - rise 15 per cent since just after Labor took office, giving the average household a $5324 a year boost, or $102 a week. The results of the survey by the University of Canberra's national centre for social and economic modelling go much of the way to answering the question Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has asked repeatedly throughout the election campaign: ''Are we better off than we were six years ago?'' The answer, at least in terms of family incomes, is an emphatic ''yes'' according to the centre's research. Since Labor took power, the ''standard of living'' - the centre's term for rises in disposable income subtracted by cost of living increases - has risen 2.6 per cent a year, the exact same average annual increase as during the 11 years of the Howard government.'

I notice only three comments on what would be a very popularly read article (and not for any good reason). How about you just go back to reporting the news facts, in an objective manner and leave the judgement about who should be PM to voting individuals. As a LNP supporter I found your 2007 endorsement, under your Editor's name (married to a Labour Party Minister no less) a shameful disgrace. How did that recommendation go for you? Kevin Rudd wreaked more damage on Australia that an 'out-of-ideas' Coalition ever would have.

Please don't take our penalty rates, please don't take money of the pensioners to pay for your baby bonus, please don't allow employers to have a free pass to use 457 workers and put there lives at risk with poor safety conditions and minimal wages. Why not put thought into reopening our steel mills so when huge companies from overseas want to build gas plants etc, they have to use Australian steel instead of inferior poor quality steel from overseas, when we have a prime minister that stops fruit and veggies from being imported from o/s, a prime minister that will reopen out textile industry, a prime minister that will re invigorate our building industry and increase the wages of apprentice's so the young are encouraged to get a trade, when we have a prime minister that has the intestinal fortitude to carry out these types of things, then we will see Australia truly come to the fore of economic grow and have a population that will benefit on equal footings from strong committed leadership.

The really sad thing is that the one's who believe the BS and lies you have written will be the ones who will be most disadvantaged if Abbott should win and it will have a terrible effect on their and our lives! I only hope that the number of people who are informed enough to see through Murdoch's lies and those who are offended by some American billionaire trying to influence our vote is higher than the number of people stupid enough to believe this dribble and those who are uninformed or just don't care.

Woooooooo, is that why my income under labor was less than during the Howard era.

But it would be better if no one knew what has happened to the minority groups. All those that I have spoken to ( not part of child support) are in the same boat. Less money under Labor. When Gillard changed the law on single parent payment no one knew that others like myself would be paying the difference to cover her reduction in payments.

What is it with all those protesting the Telegraph taking a position? This is a privately owned newspaper, right? Don't like it? Don't read it, buy another, start your own, get on the Internet web site of the ABC or switch to ABC24 TV for bias the other way. Privately owned newspapers are not required to be unbiased. They never were. Balance comes from having freedom of expression, equal opportunity to present alternate views, and having multiple outlets providing all manner of views. If all you people whinging about media bias towards the Coalition bought more of the Fairfax newspapers, or the CP publications (Communist party in case you wondered), then perhaps you would get more media leaning towards Labor. But who in the right mind can possibly lean towards Labor nowadays? Nobody seems to care too much about Labor leaning media and YOU whingers have sent Fairfax broke by yourselves by not being willing to pay for a newspaper with your world viewpoint. Start your own newspaper, or buy the one you identify with, and stop whinging.

We have had the fear campaign, then the smear campaign, and now we have the feigned disgust from the labor underlings who have been ordered to comment on this article by their masters. The same masters who can see the gravy train coming to a stop, where all the corrupt and incompetent labor staff get kicked off the train. Even your moaning and groaning is not going to save you, or influence anybody else.

""I will bet my leftie, that no household will have a cheaper power bill once the carbon tax is removed"" The Carbon Tax has been removed by the current Labor government, so this argument is useless in the comparison of both parties. I will not be voting for either party, based on views that have not been shoved down my throat by the 'media'. The greens present the best policies and stick to their own philosophy in a way that no other party has and it makes me sad that not many people will even give them a chance when both major parties are flawed and hypocritical.

Extreme bias, can we believe anything else you have published? Clearly there's a political agenda at play here - hopefully the majority of Australia isn't blinded by all this. If the liberals win we are sunk, a recession and hostilities with our country's neighbours will be on the cards with them at the helm...

This article and the cover of today's paper disgusts me. How can this country 'need' a racist, homophobic, sexist man as their leader. A man who wont even tell us how he is going to 'fix' the budget and wont release policies until the eleventh hour. A man who is willing to invest more money in roads than education and a man who by his own admission says things that he doesn't mean. I will never buy this paper again. How can you seriously say ""We are not, and have never been, cheerleaders for any one side of politics."" VERY POOR Journalism.

Judging by the majority of comments made so far it seems that all the Labor lovers are unable to accept the fact that Labor should be subject to any criticism of its performance over the last six years. The polls to date would seem to support the view of the Telegtaph. Also, the same people seem to resent any attempt by a FREE press (not one restricted by Conroy) to offer its opinion on a government's performance. It's simple - if you don't like what the Telegraph writes then don't buy the paper. Finally, it seems certain Abbott will be Prime Minister come Sunday regardless of all the wingeing and whining listed here. Suck it up, you Labor lovers!

To the author of this article: What a load of absolute tripe. Not one word of this rubbish has any truthful basis. How can you play down some of the most important (and popular) reforms in history as ""Bad Government""? The rest or your article has no logical argument. There was more legislation passed in the last 6 years than ever under a minority government. Where is your evidence? Where is your critique? Call your self a journalist? You should be ashamed. Good luck with your career as a cheerleader. Your hypocrisy is nauseating and you've eared your title well.

Labor made a big mistake to change the leadership from Julia Gillard to Kevin Rudd by the internal coup. After 3 times, the Kevin Rudd's rivalry got it, but they have to pay the price in the election on September 7, 2013. The big gun in Labor is Bill Shorten, also known as PIE MINISTER who turned the face too quick, it was just a half then Kevin Rudd became the Recycled minister, that rarely happens in the Australia political history. A painful lesson to be learnt for Julia Gillard about the betrayal of her sisterhood Penny Wong. If Julia Gillard still remains her top job, the poll would be better than Kevin Rudd, because she could be endorsed by female voters, actually she could drop some tears in debate. However, Mr. Kevin Rudd doesn't, nevertheless he was lost the people's trust on asylum seeker policy, carbon tax. Mr. Kevin Rudd couldn't be trusted, he has changed the face and promised for his purpose, but after then he will do different. As example, recently, he supports the same sex marriage, but before he didn't Do not trust anything Mr. Kevin Rudd said, let's see he did. Hoa Minh Truong.

The Telegraph is only agreeing with what the majority of Australians want and that's to see the end of probably the worst Government in our history. As they wasted money and did their sleazy deals to stay in power they forgot about Australians, it was all about them and they treated us like fools and still are as Rudd runs a scare campaign to try and fool voters once again. It's over Rudd and Labor, maybe you will learn your lesson when hopefully you lose, but I doubt it.

Those at ABC/ Fairfax believe that any leader of the Labor Party is worthy to rule- doesnt matter who it is at all!! It is inconceivable that Labor have it right every year, every leader, every policy! We have seen enough damage over the years to back this. This cycle the credos go to Liberals/ Abbott hands down!

In the corridor, a bearded man begins to cough like a wounded seal. It sounds like an animal is dying.

What an appallingly blatant promotion of the Liberal Party. This isn't news it is very deliberate ""encouragement"" of a specific political agenda. This despite your arrogant and disreputable ""this isn't about party politics"" comment, I say that your Sunday paper is nothing more than a free to the Liberal Party how to vote magazine for the ill informed, ignorant and inept. A thorough analysis of this countries politics is sorely needed, clearly your paper lacks the integrity, professionalism and journalistic integrity for that role though. Today's ""editorial"" goes well beyond the pail and is a complete abuse of the much vaunted freedom of the press. At least the frequently lambasted by the myopic ABC provides both sides of an argument for analysis, I know many do not understand that because of being saturated with articles like this one. It'd be nice to see some serious calling out of both the primary parties who have miserably failed the interests of broader Australia. Arguably any vote for the two primary parties is a waste.

After listening to the labor campain launch, I'M convienced that Kevin Rudd should not be ellected as prime minister. Iwas wondering if therese was trying to help Tony Abbott instead of her husband. whene she described Kevin as a reakless money waster She said that she needed a single candle,but when Kevin returned he had bought a ladder an electrical cord and another half a dozen items that where not needed, and he never bought the candle. .Thats Kevin Rudd alright ,always wasteing money on any thing but the right things. And i was also discusted at Anthony Albanese when as he tried to put down Tony Abbott by saying that if you want a prime minister that jumps true tyers then vote for Tony Abbott Albanese wasn't just putting Tony Abbott down, but the whole Australian defence force, by saying that all that they are good for is to jump true tyers. No wonder that labor doesn't have any confidence in the Australian defence forces that they can stop the boats, if thats what labor think about them .that they are only good to jump into tyers. The more these idiots talk the deeper they dig themselves into the whole. They never know whene to stop diging.

All I say to the rest of Australia is you'll get what you vote for.... mark my words Abbott will be as big a disaster as what another term of Labour will be. Have a look at what is happening in the UK and you'll see where we are headed! What is bizarre to me is the very people that will vote Abbott in are the ones that will be screwed over by him. Australia will learn a harsh lesson, no matter who wins the election next Saturday.

109808052412959_576068855786874,"An Israeli human rights organization has called for an investigation into systematic abuse of minors in Israeli police custody.

B'Tselem says dozens of children have been bashed and abused at the Gush Etzion police station after being arrested on suspicion of throwing stones.

Many have been hit with guns and sticks, and have been threatened with rape and sexual assault. Young boys have been told if they did not agree to 'confess' to charges against them their mother or sister would be raped.

B'Tselem, in a report published this week, said it had been documenting cases of abuse since November 2009. During the past three years the organization has received testimonies from dozens of Palestinian residents of the Bethlehem and Hebron districts, most of them minors, alleging they were subjected to threats and violence, sometimes amounting to torture, during their interrogation at the police station at Gush Etzion. The station is located within the jurisdiction of the SHAI (Judea and Samaria) District of the Israel Police. The testimonies describe interrogations in which the minors were forced to confess to alleged offenses, mostly stone-throwing. In almost all cases, the interrogators stopped using violence against the children once they confessed.

""The interrogator made me go into a room. He grabbed my head and started banging it against the wall,"" a 14 year old boy told B'Tselem. ""Then he punched me, slapped me and kicked my legs. The pain was immense, and I felt like I couldn't stand any longer. Then he started swearing at me. He said filthy things about me and about my mother. He threatened to rape me, or perform sexual acts on me, if I didn't confess to throwing stones. His threats really scared me, because he was very cruel and it was just the two of us in the room. I remembered what I'd seen on the news, when British and American soldiers raped and took photos of naked Iraqis.""  

B'Tselem said this week it began receiving reports of violence against Palestinian minors during interrogation at the Etzion police station in November 2009. Until July 2013, B'Tselem field researchers collected 64 testimonies from residents of eight communities in the southern West Bank who reported such incidents. Of the sixty four, 56 of them were minors at the time of their interrogation. The testimonies described severe physical violence during the interrogation or preliminary questioning, which, in some cases, amounted to torture. The violence included slaps, punches and kicks to all parts of the body, and blows with objects, such as a gun or a stick. Some of the victims also reported threats: in twelve cases, they claimed that the interrogator had threatened them or female relatives with sexual assault, such as rape and genital injury. In six cases, children claimed that the interrogators had threatened to execute them; in eight cases, the interrogators allegedly threatened to harm family members; and in five other cases, they allegedly threatened to electrocute the interrogatees, including in a way that would damage their fertility.

In addition, twelve detainees stated that their initial confession had been taken by an interrogator in civilian clothes and that, to the best of their knowledge, at that stage, it had not been recorded. Only after they confessed to stone-throwing, they were transferred to another room, where an interrogator in police uniform asked them to repeat their confession, this time recording them. Later, the interrogators told them to sign a document in Hebrew, a language they do not understand, without knowing what they were signing.

""The interrogator ""Daud"" took me outside with a soldier. They blindfolded me. The plastic cable ties were still on my hands. They put me in a car and started driving. I don't know where they took me,"" a 15 year old boy told field researchers. ""We reached some place outside Etzion and they forced me out of the car. My hands really hurt because of the cable ties. They took off my blindfold. I didn't know where I was. They tied me to a tree, and then they raised my cuffed hands and tied them to the tree, too. It hurt a lot. ""Daud"" started punching me. After a few minutes, he took out a gun and said: ""I'll murder you if you don't confess. Out here, no one will find you. We'll kill you and leave you here.""

B'Tselem says it sent 31 complaints to the Department for Investigation of Police (DIP) on behalf of victims who reported they had been subjected to violence and threats by interrogators at the Etzion station. 

Of the 31 detainees in whose name B'Tselem complained to the DIP, 20 eventually withdrew from their intention to file a formal complaint and give testimony to DIP investigators for fear that it would result in harm to members of the family who had already been interrogated or to other relatives, or because of a general lack of trust in the Israeli justice system. The DIP decided not to investigate any complaints in which the complainant had not personally testified before investigators. Based on replies given to B'Tselem, none of the information sent to the DIP regarding those cases was checked.

The DIP only opened investigations into the eleven cases in which the complainants had personally given testimony. Three of the case files were closed and the investigation of eight, all opened in June 2012 or later, is still under way.

In its correspondence with the DIP, B'Tselem demanded the issue of violent interrogations at the Etzion station be handled systemically, and not just through the investigation of each individual complaint. B'Tselem representatives also presented this demand to officials in the Israel Police and the Ministry of Justice. The DIP replied that a systemic investigation of the matter was under way.

Although B'Tselem says it contacted the Israel Police on this matter repeatedly, no official answer was given to the question whether any steps had been taken to address the phenomenon and, if so, what they were. All the Israeli human rights organization's communications with the police on the matter were met with denial. For example, the organization says, in a meeting held on 7 January 2013, between B'Tselem representatives and the commander of the Hebron Police Division, the police officials denied the phenomenon existed. They refused to comment on the complaints themselves, claiming they could not verify the details of the cases since they were under ongoing investigation by the DIP, and there was a concern of obstructing the investigation. At the meeting, B'Tselem was also informed that the interrogation officer at the Etzion station had been replaced, although it was emphasized that this was unrelated to the complaints made by B'Tselem.

The high number of reports B'Tselem has received regarding violent interrogations at the Etzion station, and the fact that they span several years, gives rise, says B'Tselem, to heavy suspicion that this is not a case of a single interrogator who chose to use illegal interrogation methods, but rather an entire apparatus that backs him up and allows such conduct to take place. Yet, to the best of B'Tselem's knowledge it says, no real effort has been made to date to discontinue the abuse, and no systemic investigation has taken place. The only action that has been taken was the investigation of individual complaints, which, more than a year later, have not concluded. ""Law enforcement agencies are allowing this reality to continue, despite the fact that all the relevant officials know that the claims relate to violence against minors under interrogation, and that, in some cases, the violence has amounted to torture,"" a B'Tselem statement said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/576068855786874/?type=3,2013-08-29 21:23:11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_576025945791165,"Several weeks after the arrest of a 5 year old boy by the Israeli army, there has been no official investigation commenced.

The boy was detained in Hebron for two hours, after he threw a stone, according to a report by the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem. The soldiers threatened the child and his parents, handcuffed and blindfolded the father, and handed the boy over to the Palestinian Police.

Mid-afternoon on Tuesday, 9 July 2013, seven soldiers and an officer detained Wadi Maswadeh near the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, after he threw a stone. B'Tselem field researcher Manal al-Ja'bari, who was present at the scene, recorded the entire event on video. After local residents who had gathered at the spot tried to intervene, the soldiers put the crying child into a jeep with another Palestinian resident and took him home. When they reached the house, B'Tselem said in its report, the officer informed Wadi's mother that he intended to hand him over to the Palestinian Police. The mother refused to let them take the child before his father, Karam, came home. About half an hour after Wadi was detained, Karam Maswadeh came home. The officer informed Maswadeh that he was arresting his son in order to hand him over to the Palestinian Police. Meanwhile, Wadi' had spent the entire time hiding behind a pile of mattresses in the house and crying. The parents made it clear to the officer that the child is five years old, but the officer insisted on taking him to the DCO and threatened them, saying that the army would arrest the father if they did not comply. The soldiers then made Karam and his son leave the house and walk to the army camp on a-Shuhada street.

""When I got home, I saw several soldiers standing at the entrance to my house. An officer came up to me and ordered me to get my son, Wadi,"" Karam Maswadeh said in his testimony to B'Tselem. ""Before I got home, the soldiers had tried to persuade my wife to hand Wadi over, but she had refused to do it until I came back. The officer told me that he was going to arrest Wadi and hand him over to the Palestinian Coordination. I asked him: ""Why arrest a five-year-old boy?"" A soldier standing next to the officer showed me a stone and claimed that my son had thrown it, and that it had hit the car of a settler who was driving north, near 'Abed checkpoint. I tried to persuade the officer not to take Wadi' to the DCO, but he said that if I didn't bring him, I'd be arrested. I went inside the house and got Wadi', who was hiding there. He was crying.""

Wadi and his father were taken to the Israeli army base, where they were detained for half an hour. Then, the soldiers handcuffed and blindfolded Karam and walked him, in full public view, together with his son, to the Policeman's checkpoint (56), where the soldiers detained them for another thirty minutes, says B'Tselem. At that point, a lieutenant colonel arrived whom the father, who speaks Hebrew, understood to be an Israeli coordination officer from the DCO. The officer questioned Wadi and asked him why he had thrown stones. He also reprimanded the soldiers for arresting the father and son in the presence of video cameras, and complained that ""you're harming our public image"". The officer made it clear to the soldiers that, when detainees are held with cameras around, they must be ""treated nicely"". Then, one of the soldiers untied the father's hands, removed his blindfold and gave him water. A few minutes later, an officer from the Palestinian DCO and several Palestinian policemen arrived. The soldiers handed Karam and Wadi Maswadeh over to them, and the two were taken to a Palestinian police station, where they were briefly questioned and released.

In a letter to the Legal Adviser to Judea and Samaria, B'Tselem Director Jessica Montell said, ""The footage clearly shows that this was not a mistake made by an individual soldier, but rather conduct that, to our alarm, was considered reasonable by all the military personnel involved, including senior officers. It is particularly troubling that none of them apparently thought any part of the incident wad problematic: not the fact that they scared a five-year-old boy out of his wits, nor threatening him and his parents to ""hand him over"" to the Palestinian Police, nor threatening to arrest the father on no legal grounds, nor handcuffing and blindfolding the father in front of his son.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/576025945791165/?type=3,2013-08-29 18:42:27,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_575587929168300,"Australians go to the polls on Saturday week with the big issue in the election n being the economy. While the country is coming off its highs on the alleged peaking of the mining boom, there are other countries around the world that would give anything to be in Australia's place. Take this story we're running today from Ireland, penned by Eoin Hahessy of the Irish Independent:

Australia is what Ireland once was. A nation obsessed with property. 

Newspapers bulge with glossy property sections; television is littered with DIY and home improvement shows.

It is simply impossible to plot a route through Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane or Perth that doesn't involve bumping into a swarm of construction workers or 'tradies' building the latest addition to an Australian skyline.

In a nation where median home values have increased by 86 per cent in real terms from $259,000 in 2001 to $482,000 in 2010, property prices still reserve a place in the conversational Rolodex at dinner parties.

After 22 years of successive economic growth without a sniff of a recession, Australia is one of the wealthiest countries in the world.

""The decade to 2010 was one of considerable growth in the wealth portfolios of Australian households, with average wealth increasing in real terms, from $495,000 in 2002 to $684,000 in 2010,"" says University of Melbourne Associate Professor Roger Wilkins. Astute financial management, geological luck but significantly China were primary reasons why the world's forgotten continent has seen its wealth surge.

China gorged on Australia's natural resources, primarily its iron ore, a vital ingredient for steel and a building block for impatient industrial nations determined to influence the rest of the world.

Stretching back 150 years, mining has always been closely tied to Australia's economic fortunes. In this last decade, however, Australia experienced a mining boom.

Modern technology, entrepreneurial determination and world demand conspired to produce sprawling vast mines in deeply barren, sun-drenched regions across Australia. Surrounded by red soils in temperatures that surpass 40 degrees, workers, many of whom are Irish, earn an average of $2,000 (1,300) a week extracting minerals such as iron ore and coal before supplying hungry world markets. It is a desolate life and a simple formula but one that reaps handsome dividends.

One man who has had a ringside seat from the very beginning of Australia's mining boom has been Rathfarnham native Mark Keogh.

In 1998 Keogh established his mining services company, UON, in Perth in Western Australia. Since then his company has grown from six to 148, bagging national industry awards in the process and working with the towering mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.

""Back in the Nineties this was an industry that was operating on its bare bones, today it is an entirely different beast where your success depends on the type of individual that you are.""

Individuals tempered for this mining environment have reaped the rewards. In the decade to 2012-13, according to the Grattan Institute, real wages grew by 2.7 per cent in the Australian mining states, almost triple the 1 per cent a year in the non-mining states.

With mining workers earning an average of $150,000 (102,000) a year, a new reference was coined to describe them: CUBs or Cashed-up Bogans, (bogan is Australian slang for an uneducated blue-collar worker).

They spent lavishly and the economic tentacles spread.

""Between 2009 to the end of the last year, the mining investment boom added 1 per cent per annum to Australia's growth rate, basically a third of the total growth of the entire country,"" underlined the chief economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Australia, Saul Eslake. With high commodity prices, Australia's trade and dollar all shot up.

Not long after it was floated in 1982, the Australian dollar suffered a plunge after a few ill-chosen words.

""We'll just end up being a third-rate economy. You know, a banana republic"" these off-the-cuff remarks from the then treasurer, Paul Keating, as Australia was mired in recession in the Eighties, led to the 'Aussie' plunging by 10 per cent.

Today, the dollar is a sinewy beast, made muscular by high commodity prices and lovingly caressed by nervous investors who fled to a safe haven in the turmoil of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).

In 2011 the dollar hit a 28-year high of 110.55 US cents and Australia has been left standing with just seven other countries in the world that hold a triple-A rating. It has been a source of thumping pride to the Aussies as they have seen their currency soar, but it has come at a cost.

Australia is suffering what economists call a classic case of 'Dutch Disease'. Coined in 1977 to explain the decline of the manufacturing industry in the Netherlands after the discovery of natural gas there in the Fifties, Australia is today frantically searching for a cure. The high dollar is accelerating the erosion of Australia's manufacturing industry, particularly its automotive industry, and is leaving sizeable trade-exposed industries such as tourism and education to suffer the consequences. ""The high currency while being a reflection of Australia's good economic fortunes compared to other countries has certainly taken a toll on Australia's competitiveness,"" says Eslake.

One of the biggest casualties of this currency squeeze has been Ford, which after nine decades in the country announced in May it was packing up, with the loss of 1,200 jobs.

Although Australia did experience increased unemployment due to the GFC, it nimbly sidestepped the worst extremities. Yet the impact is still being felt in two areas, a political fixation to not run a budget deficit and a dent in the typical Australian swagger translated as sharply reduced consumer confidence.

Flick on a radio in the last 12 months in Australia and one would have thought that the IMF had just politely knocked on the door. The economic catastrophe that consumed Europe and the high deficits ran up by eurozone countries has infected public debate and drove a hysteric political mantra to achieve a budgetary surplus at all costs. Such economic fretting has assisted in wilting consumer confidence with recent retail sales posting their weakest fiscal year in more than half a century as Australians decide to opt for the piggy bank instead of the credit card.

""In the last 12 months consumer spending in Australia has been weak reflecting an increase in precautionary savings as Australians confront prospects of slower growth in activity and employment,"" said Professor Guay Lin of the Melbourne Institute.

In an effort to jumpstart the economy the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates eight times since November 2011, to its now historic level of 2.5 per cent. The economy has failed to ignite.

Nervous consumers, a high exchange rate eroding trade-exposed sectors, mixed with a lack of political direction and a slowdown in China and you have the perfect recipe for a sluggish Australian economy.

China and the Asian region exert a hypnotic hold over Australia. Not a week passes without a polished conference seeking to explore opportunities in this 'Asian Century.' It is not surprising considering that 35 per cent of Australian exports are gobbled by China and that by 2030 Asia is expected to account for 60 per cent of global middle-class consumption. That's quite a lot of customers sitting on your doorstep.

China's slowdown and move to a new era of sub-10 per cent economic growth impacted Australia. As commodity prices fell from their meteoric highs, mining companies have responded by reining in expansion plans and cutting back on contractors. In the past year Australia's coal industry laid off 11,000 workers, a fifth of its workforce. While Australia's commodity prices have fallen for five months in a row, they still remain high and the economic juggernaut that is China will continue to ensure opportunities remain in Australia's mining frontiers.

""There is no western economy that is more exposed to a risk of a hard landing in China than Australia is, but there is a low probability of a hard landing in China,"" said Eslake.

The Minerals Council of Australia estimates the country needs an additional 86,000 workers by 2020 and from his operations in Perth, Dubliner Keogh is bullish, identifying the next expansion wave as natural gas, adding ""the resources industry is simply going to span the next 20 to 50 years"".

The sun isn't setting on Australian economic fortunes, rather it is shedding light on new opportunities. Earlier this year the Australian Economic Review outlined the startling fact that in 2012, more people are employed in healthcare and social assistance services than in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Mining is significantly important, but economic opportunities exist across sectors.

The engineering, medical and trades sectors have been areas where Irish workers have been traditionally hoovered up. In the 2011 Australian census, 67,316 people listed Ireland as their country of birth, a whopping increase of 33 per cent from the 2006 census. Education and skills of a high quality combined with the Irish work ethic have been vital ingredients in Irish success under the sun.

In his office in Sydney, Belfast local and migration expert John McQuaid outlines the demographic time bomb facing Australia: ""In the next 10 to 20 years, Australia is going to have so many people hitting the retirement age that there isn't simply enough young people to keep the economy going.

""The government, irrespective of its political persuasion, realises that the key to Australia's continued stability and growth is through migration.""

Migration, both legal and illegal, has been at the very tip of the political arrows that have been erratically flying in Australia for the past year, as an exhausting election year culminates with a general election on September 7. An unpopular Labor government, in a move to reinvigorate a disenchanted union base, promised a clampdown on the 457 visa which has been the main gateway for Irish people working in Australia.

So far there has been much political rhetoric about ""protecting local jobs"" with the only practical change being a doubling of visa fees, making it that more financially onerous, for example, for young families seeking to move to Australia.

As the government viciously duels with the coalition for the seats of power in the capital of Canberra, the tone of political debate and absence of leadership concerns the business community. Unemployment lies at 5.7 per cent in Australia, but in an election year perspective is lost. The recent announcement of a $30bn (20.4bn) budget deficit equating to 1.9 per cent of GDP, compared to the US deficit equivalent of 5.4 per cent, and the euro area's gap of 2.6 per cent of GDP, was met with howls of protest.

""A change of mindset and a focus on what Australia has, as opposed to what it doesn't have, is sorely needed. There are many positives here, but unfortunately the negatives generate more reaction and reporting,"" says the president of the Irish-Australian Chamber of Commerce, Colin Egan.

In the very heart of Melbourne, at the corner of Queen and La Trobe streets sits a commanding and beautiful Victorian building with a striking edifice that wraps across both streets. It is the home of the Celtic Club, the second-oldest Irish organisation in Australia, established in 1887 to help release the English grip on Ireland by obtaining Home Rule.

Today it serves as a meeting point for generations who arrived here by air, and of their own free will. In an illustration of the times, it is not political upheaval that is occupying its members' minds, but rather they are mulling over a $12m bid by developers, eager to turn their home in a 48-level tower. Inside the historic building the club president, Seamus Moloughney, reflects on Irish opportunities Down Under.

""I look out across this Melbourne sky and I see cranes dotted with Irish surnames. You could be back home listening to the endless drip of bad news on the radio or you could come out here and grab the opportunities.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/575587929168300/?type=3,2013-08-28 16:15:32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_575221169204976,"The ""responsibility to protect"" (R2P) doctrine invoked to legitimize the 2011 war on Libya has just transmogrified into ""responsibility to attack"" (R2A) Syria. Just because the Obama administration says so.

On Sunday, the White House said it had ''very little doubt'' that the Bashar al-Assad government used chemical weapons against its own citizens. On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry ramped it up to ''undeniable'' - and accused Assad of ''moral obscenity''.

So when the US bombed Fallujah with white phosphorus in late 2004 it was just taking the moral high ground. And when the US helped Saddam Hussein to gas Iranians in 1988 it was also taking the moral high ground.

The Obama administration has ruled that Assad allowed UN chemical weapons inspectors into Syria, and to celebrate their arrival unleashed a chemical weapons attack mostly against women and children only 15 kilometers away from the inspectors' hotel. If you don't believe it, you subscribe to a conspiracy theory.

Evidence? Who cares about evidence? Assad's offer of access for the inspectors came ''too late''. Anyway, the UN team is only mandated to determine whether chemical weapons were deployed - but not by who, according to UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon's spokesman.

As far as the Obama administration and UK Prime Minister David ''of Arabia'' Cameron are concerned - supported by a barrage of corporate media missiles - that's irrelevant; Obama's ''red line'' has been crossed by Assad, period. Washington and London are in no-holds-barred mode to dismiss any facts contradicting the decision. Newspeak - of the R2A kind - rules. If this all looks like Iraq 2.0 that's because it is. Time to fix the facts around the policy - all over again. Time for weapons of mass deception - all over again.

The window of opportunity for war is now. Assad's forces were winning from Qusayr to Homs; pounding ''rebel'' remnants out of the periphery of Damascus; deploying around Der'ah to counterpunch CIA-trained ''rebels'' with advanced weapons crossing the Syrian-Jordanian border; and organizing a push to expel ''rebels'' and jihadis from suburbs of Aleppo.

Now, Israel and Saudi Arabia are oh so excited because they are getting exactly what they dream just by good ol' Wag the Dog methods. Tel Aviv has even telegraphed how it wants it: this Monday, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper headlined with ''On the Way to Attack'' and even printed the ideal Order of Battle.

Months ago, even AMAN, the Intelligence Directorate of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) concluded that Assad was not a fool to cross Obama's chemical weapon ''red line''. So they came up with the concept of ''two entwined red lines'', the second line being the Syrian government ''losing control of its chemical weapons depots and production sites''. AMAN then proposed different strategies to Washington, from a no-fly zone to actually seizing the weapons (implying a ground attack).

It's now back to the number one option - air strikes on the chemical weapons depots. As if the US - and Israel - had up-to-the-minute intelligence on exactly where they are.

The House of Saud had also telegraphed its wishes - after Prince Bandar bin Sultan, aka Bandar Bush, was appointed by King Abdullah as head of Saudi General Intelligence. Abdullah's hard on is explained by his mother and two of his wives coming from an influential, ultra-conservative Sunni tribe in Syria. As for Bandar Bush, he has more longevity than Rambo or the Terminator; he's back in the same role he played in the 1980s Afghan jihad, when he was the go-to guy helping the CIA to weaponize president president Ronald Reagan's ''freedom fighters''.

Jordan - a fiction of a country totally dependent on the Saudis - was easily manipulated into becoming a ''secret'' war operation center. And who's in charge? No less than Bandar's younger half-brother, and deputy national security adviser, Salman bin Sultan, also known as ''mini-Bandar''. Talk about an Arab version of Dr Evil and Mini Me.

Still, there are more CIA assets than Saudis in the Jordanian front.

The importance of this report cannot be overstated enough. It was initially leaked to Lebanon's Al-Safir newspaper. Here's Bandar's whole strategy, unveiled in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, reported by Asia Times Online. After trying - for four hours - to convince Putin to drop Syria, Bandar is adamant: ''There is no escape from the military option.''

Former president Bill Clinton resurfaced with perfect timing to compare Obama's options in Syria to Reagan's jihad in Afghanistan. Bubba was right in terms of positioning Bandar's role. But he must have inhaled something if he was thinking in terms of consequences - which include everything from the Taliban to that mythical entity, ''al-Qaeda''. Well, at least al-Qaeda is already active in Syria; they don't need to invent it.

As for that bunch of amateurs surrounding Obama - including R2P groupies such as Susan Rice and new Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, all of them liberal hawks - they are all suckers for Kosovo. Kosovo - with a Libya add-on - is being spun as the ideal model for Syria; R2P via (illegal) air strikes. Right on cue, the New York Times is already frantically parroting the idea.

Facts are, of course, absent from the narrative - including the blowing up of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade (a remix in Syria with the Russian embassy?) and getting to the brink of a war with Russia.

Syria has nothing to do with the Balkans. This is a civil war. Arguably the bulk of the Syrian urban population, not the country bumpkins, support Damascus - based on despicable ''rebel'' behavior in places they control; and the absolute majority wants a political solution, as in the now near-totally torpedoed Geneva II conference.

The Jordanian scheme - inundating southern Syria with heavily weaponized mercenaries - is a remix of what the CIA and the Saudis did to AfPak; and the only winner will be Jabhat al-Nusra jihadis. As for the Israeli solution for Obama - indiscriminate bombing of chemical weapons depots - it will certainly result in horrendous collateral damage, as in R2A killing even more civilians.

The prospects remain grim. Damn another coalition of the willing; Washington already has the British and French poodles in the bag, and full support - in air-con safety - from the democratic Gulf Cooperation Council petro-monarchies, minion Jordan and nuclear power Israel. This is what passes for ''international community'' in the newspeak age.

The Brits are already heavily spinning that no UN Security Council resolution is needed; who cares if we do Iraq 2.0? For the War Party, the fact that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey said Syrian ''rebels'' could not promote US interests seems to be irrelevant.

Washington already has what it takes for the Holy Tomahawks to start flying; 384 of them are already positioned in the Eastern Mediterranean. B-1 bombers can be deployed from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. And bunker-busting bombs will certainly be part of the picture.

What happens next requires concentric crystal balls - from Tomahawks to a barrage of air strikes to Special Ops commandos on the ground to a sustained air campaign lasting months. In his long interview to Izvestia, Assad gives the impression he thinks Obama is bluffing.

What's certain is that Syria won't be a ''piece of cake'' like Libya; even depleted on all fronts, Gaddafi resisted for eight long months after NATO started its humanitarian bombing. Syria has a weary but still strong army of 200,000; loads of Soviet and Russian weapons; very good antiaircraft systems; and full support from asymmetrical warfare experts Iran and Hezbollah. Not to mention Russia, which just needs to forward a few S-300 air defense batteries and relay solid intelligence.

So get used to how international relations work in the age of newspeak. General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's army in Egypt can kill hundreds of his own people who were protesting against a military coup. Washington couldn't care less - as in the coup that is not a coup and the bloodbath that is not a bloodbath.

No one knows for sure what exactly happened in the chemical weapons saga near Damascus. But that's the pretext for yet another American war - just a few days before a Group of 20 summit hosted by Putin in St Petersburg. Holy Tomahawk! R2A, here we go.

109808052412959_572270926166667,"""Lord! You know well that my keen desire is to carry out Your commandments and to serve Thee with all my heart, O light of my eyes. If I were free I would pass the whole day and night in prayers. But what should I do when you have made me a slave of a human being?""

These were the words of the female Muslim mystic and poet, Rabia Al-Adawiya. Her journey from slavery to freedom served as a generational testament of the resolve of the individual who was armed with faith and nothing else.

Rabia's story is multifarious, and despite the fact that the Muslim saint died over 12 centuries ago, few Egyptians are failing to see the centrality of her narrative to their own. In the north of the Nasr City district, tens of thousands of Egyptians chose the iconic mosque named after her to stage their sit-in and demanded the return to shar'iya (legitimacy) after it was seized in a brazen military coup which ousted elected President Mohammed Morsi on July 03.

Rabia's narrative is essential because it was about freedom. She was born into a very poor family in Basra, Iraq. According to Farid ud-Din Attar who related her story, she was so poor that when she was born the family had nothing to wrap around her, not even oil to light their only lamp. Years later when Rabia was a grownup, she was kidnapped and sold into Egyptian slavery as she tried to escape a deadly famine in Iraq.

Rabia didn't exactly challenge her master through organizing strikes and defiant sit-ins. She was alone and dominated by too many powerful forces that made her life of slavery and degradation absolute. So she spent most of the day as a slave, but late at night she would stay up and pray. It was more than praying, but an attempt at reclaiming her humanity, at comprehending the multitude of forces that chained her to earthly relations of slave and master, and in a sense, she tried to discover a level of freedom that could not be granted by a master's wish. 

In fact, her true 'miracle' was that of her faith under the harshest possible conditions, and her ability to strive for freedom while practically speaking, she remained a slave. It is as if this female poet, a heroin and a saint by the standards of many poor, downtrodden people, managed to redefine the relationship of the ongoing class struggle, and found freedom within herself. It is believed that her inconceivable faith was so strong that her master could not deal with the guilt of holding a saint a slave. So, she was freed.

Regardless of the precision of the details, Rabia Al-Adawiya's legacy has passed on from one generation of Egyptians to the next. Like her, many of these Egyptians are mostly poor, immensely patient, and are hostage to the same century-old class struggle by which Rabia was defined.

In some way, the January 25 revolution included millions of Rabias fed up with oppression and servitude. But the class division that was highlighted after millions of Egyptians rose against the military coup became clearer than ever. These were the poorest of the poor, long alienated and dehumanized by both the ruling class and the conceited, intellectual groupings of self-described liberals and socialists. The unprecedented union between Egypt's ruling class and anti-Muslim intellectual elite succeeded, to an extent, in blocking our view from the substantial class struggle underway in Egypt, where the poorest communities – yes, workers and peasants – were leading a historic struggle to reclaim democracy from the upper and middle class intellectuals. The former committed hideous murders against peaceful protesters, while the latter group found a way to explain why it was completely fine to mow down thousands of people staging massive sit-ins in Nahda Square, and yes, Rabia Al-Adawiya Square, named after Rabia.

The Rabias of Egypt are not hated, they are loathed. They have always been treated as sub-humans that live in their own dirty quarters which are unbelievably neglected shantytowns made up of haggard buildings stacked atop one another.  The Rabias of Egypt struggle to merely survive on a daily basis.

Faith serves the poor more than it serves the rich, so they have their mosques. It is a last escape against the harsh grinds of life. When the January 25 revolution erupted, a temporary union existed between the poor and the disenchanted middle class, as they had access to local and international media forums, and were disproportionately represented in their access to social media.

But when the first vote following the removal of Hosni Mubarak was held on March 19, 2011, all the way until the presidential runoff elections on June 16, 2012, the discrepancies began showing: Egypt's poor seemed to have a whole different world of political preferences, favoring religious parties that spoke their language, over the liberals, socialists and all the rest. The loudest liberals and socialists seemed to appear on television, but as several rounds of voting had shown, they were the less relevant among Egyptians. The trend was unmistakable, Egypt sought a political program that was democratic and positioned with a religious discourse. 

Liberals and socialists were once more alienated, this time democratically. Their own interpretation of a western-like democracy was in reality neither western-like nor democratic, and their combined numbers placed them at the bottom of the ladder of political relevance. They blamed everyone for their failings, initially the military, the remnants of the regime, and eventually the Muslim Brotherhood.

Previous Egyptian regimes had invested precocious resources to demonize any Egyptian Muslim with a political preference that didn't venerate the regime. They demonized the Islamists in ways that reduced them to the level of sub-humans in the eyes of the ruling class. Many of the liberal and socialist forces that took part in the Jan 25 revolution grew up knowing no other discourse except seeing political Islam as evil that must be defeated. That discourse was strengthened after the signing of the Camp David Accords in the late 1970's, for Israel was no longer the enemy, and the enemy were those who dared protest Egypt's pro-US and pro-Israel policies.

Culture doesn't change overnight. Collective thinking is not switched off and on with the press of a button. The fact is that the dominance of the Islamic narrative in post-revolution Egypt terrified those who became accustomed to the marginalization of political Islam. It was to the extent that the temporary alliance between the poor and the middle class was done with, in favor of a sinister alliance with the forces allied with the last regime, including the military. The combination was deadlier than any other time in Egypt's modern history. Thousands of people fell dead and wounded in a few hours on August 14 starting with a crackdown on Rabia Al-Adawiya's Square. The mosque was set ablaze. The depravity of the violence that followed, hailed by liberals and socialists, as well as regime supporters as a victory for democracy, is indescribable.

But as bloody and heart-wrenching as the last few days in Egypt have been, a sense of clarity finally prevailed. The Jan 25 revolution, inspiring as it was, left numerous questions unanswered, and presented the military with the opportunity to break away from the Mubaraks and re-brand itself as the protector of the nation. But real democracy proved too much for the military and the layers of corrupt political and economic elites it represents. Now, the rosy image of a peaceful revolution guided by its military to achieve a better tomorrow is over: the masks have all been lifted and the reality is much uglier than previously thought. Egypt's real struggle for freedom and political definition is just starting. 

Rabia's 12 centuries-old legacy will not vanish even after the mosque was burnt. Many of the dead were witnessed and filmed raising their forefingers to heaven in one last prayer as they let go of their last breath. The images from Egypt were gory to say the least, but the faith of Egyptians remains strong.

109808052412959_572151379511955,"A major push has been launched for U.S. soldiers Brad Manning to be pardoned by President Barack Obama.

A petition for a presidential pardon began circulating within minutes of U.S. military tribunal judge Colonel Denise Lind handing Manning a 35 year prison sentence after finding him guilty on several counts of downloading and passing on to whistle blower site WikiLeaks more than 700,000 classified documents.

Manning's lead attorney David Coombs said at a press conference at The Hotel at Arundel Preserve in Maryland shortly after the sentencing he would be seeking a presidential pardon. If not successful he would appeal for his client's sentence to be commuted to time served.

Amnesty International weighed in immediately after the sentencing calling on Obama to commute Manning's sentence to time served so he can be immediately released. The young soldier has already been in military prisons for more than 3 years, including 11 months in conditions described by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture as cruel and inhumane.

""Bradley Manning acted on the belief that he could spark a meaningful public debate on the costs of war, and specifically on the conduct of the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan. His revelations included reports on battlefield detentions and previously unseen footage of journalists and other civilians being killed in US helicopter attacks, information which should always have been subject to public scrutiny,"" Widney Brown, Senior Director of International Law and Policy at Amnesty International said Wednesday. 

""Instead of 'sending a message' by giving him a de facto life sentence the US government should turn its attention to investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the context of the ill-conceived 'war on terror',"" he added.

Some of the materials Manning leaked revealed potential human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law by US troops abroad, by Iraqi and Afghan forces operating alongside US forces, and by military contractors. Amnesty expressed concern that the judge had ruled before Manning's trial the army private would not be able to present evidence that he was acting in the public interest.

""Manning had already pleaded guilty to leaking information, so for the US to have continued prosecuting him under the Espionage Act, even charging him with 'aiding the enemy,' can only be seen as a harsh warning to anyone else tempted to expose government wrongdoing. "" said Brown. 

""More than anything else, the case shows the urgent need to reform the USA's antiquated Espionage Act and strengthen protections for those who reveal information that the public has a need and a right to know.""

Indeed on Monday the U.S. Government through prosecutor Captain Joe Morrow told Judge Lind, ""There is value in deterrence, Your Honor. This court must send a message to any soldier contemplating stealing classified information. National security crimes that undermine the entire 2 system must be taken seriously. Punish PFC Manning's actions, Your Honor. Think about the volume of information in this case. More than 700,000 records, complete and partial databases.""

Manning's petition for clemency will be filed shortly with the U.S. Department of Justice office that reviews requests for pardons and other acts of clemency before passing them on to the president for a final decision. Such requests are normally made after all appeals are exhausted, but the president has the power grant clemency at any time.

""Bradley Manning should be shown clemency in recognition of his motives for acting as he did, the treatment he endured in his early pre-trial detention, and the due process shortcomings during his trial. The President doesn't need to wait for this sentence to be appealed to commute it; he can and should do so right now,"" Brown said.

Manning, who was 21 when he was deployed to Iraq, has apologised for his actions but said he did them to spark debate and reforms in U.S. foreign policy, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. Manning was acquitted of ""Aiding the Enemy,"" but found guilty of several counts of Espionage, Computer Fraud, and Federal Theft.

The three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Manning is described by his support group as a ""heroic soldier,"" who made public 'information that exposed the unjust detainment of innocent people at Guantanamo Bay, the true human cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and forever changed investigative journalism.' They say there is no evidence that anyone was harmed as a result of the information exposed.

Manning's 'severe' sentence, they say, contrasts with the leniency given those responsible for torture and other types of grave human rights violations he revealed.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/572151379511955/?type=3,2013-08-21 16:11:53,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_572082596185500,"Courtesy of The Conversation, experts give their opinions on the latest debate between the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott in Brisbane Tuesday night.

Tom Clark, Senior Lecturer in Communication at Victoria University

Careful what you pray for! After the first encounter ten nights ago, many complained the format produced ""no real debate,"" too little critical engagement between the speakers, a lack of good old biff and tangle.

Tonight we got the B side of the cassette: tedious bickering about each other's untrustworthy opinions on side-issues. Forty minutes in, they had only managed to dispute their way through opposed non-answers to six audience questions.

Rudd was much more energetic than last time, though, and Abbott was conspicuously nastier. At one stage he openly slagged: ""Does this guy ever shut up?"" Not that he forsook his own chance to squeeze a comment in immediately afterwards.

Given the dysfunctionality of the conversation, the vagueness of the arguments exchanged, it is those personality impressions that will stay with people from this debate. So it is a points victory for the incumbent prime minister tonight. He needs more of them, and bigger ones, in the days ahead.

Denis Muller, Senior Research Fellow in the Centre for Advancing Journalism at University of Melbourne

It had a far more genuinely democratic feel that the National Press Club debate, which felt like the old pollies-and-journos club having a boring exchange in a suitably dimly lit room. This debate, in a brightly lit forum with people in hi-vis jackets and jumpers flung over their shoulders, felt real. The absence of lecterns brought the leaders closer to the audience and added to the conversational nature of the exchange. Abbott in particular seemed to open up in this less formal setting.

What was also clear, from watching the on-screen representation of viewers' reactions in the form of the ""worm"", was the voters detest negativity. This was evident when Abbott or Rudd bagged the other side. By contrast, when the leaders were civil with each other, their worm line went up. It was also clear that Labor had more credibility on climate change, and the immediate reaction of the worm suggested that this is still a very live issue. However, Rudd really scored with his commitment to marriage equality and his undertaking to bring in legislation early in the life of the new parliament. This too appears to have high salience among voters.

Rudd's closing remarks also rated consistently well. Abbott's was also well received but showed little dips every time he went negative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sean Rintel, Lecturer in Strategic Communication at University of Queensland

As Kevin Rudd responded to a follow-up during the debate, a frustrated Tony Abbott asked: ""does this guy ever shut up?""

The #auspol and #ausvotes Twitter users reacted in interesting manners. At first, in a somewhat unusual fashion, many Twitter users treated this a breach of respect towards Kevin Rudd and ""conduct unbecoming"" of a potential PM to be. For example:

@es_awesome: ""Abbott told the PM to shut up? Does he have any sense of propriety?""

@clare1mb: ""The real @TonyAbbottMHR emerges…""

@TheAviator1992: ""Abbott ""Does this guy never shut up!"" WHAT A DISGRACE!!!""

In response, Abbott supporters attempted to turn the reason for Abbott's comment into a problem for Rudd. For example:

@kaylenegerster: ""No I will not shut up folks. I will waffle on with BS as long as I want @KRuddMP""

But then the concept of Abbott telling famous people to shut up began to be the focus of snarky comment. For example:

@peterjhinton: ""Abbott meeting Chancellor Angela Merkel ""does this sheila ever shut up?! laughs""

Other famous figures included the Dalai Lama, Barack Obama, and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Finally, Twitter users started to retweet the ABC's video moment in which Kevin Rudd retorted to ""shut up"" that such a response was ""standard debating technique"". So, in terms of ""duelling memes"", it would appear that Rudd won the day in the first people's forum.

David Holmes, Senior Lecturer, Communications and Media Studies at Monash University

""It's not about journalists tonight, but it's about you the people,"" was Sky News Australia political editor and forum presenter David Speers' opener as he pointed out that a people's forum with both leaders present was a first for an election campaign in Australia.

Some anticipated that this debate might have be risky for either leader without a controlled studio situation. But the 100 invitees solicited by Galaxy Research were very restrained, and it was much more of a Q&A style of exchange, where the audience questions were pre-solicited, wide-ranging and orderly.

There were few pans to the audience to monitor reactions and no spontaneity or political emotion from the audience as the entire room listened attentively. The only flare-up was an intervention by Abbott to Rudd ""does this guy ever shut up"" at the 30 minute mark, which drew laughter from the audience, after which Rudd retorted: ""we are having a discussion, mate"".

Rudd looked uncomfortable in his opening address but less so in critique of Abbott, such as on the question of whether a Coalition government would make cuts to health and other services, where he had command of the figures (this time without notes). Although Abbott was more frequently called to account he had a self-confident style, but Rudd had the arguments on the night. For example, Abbott presented himself as bush-loving conservationist, while Rudd convincingly explained that no environmental progress could be made without addressing climate change.

Rudd's closing critique of the Queensland Newman government was a clever pitch to turn around polling in Brisbane seats, and suggest that Abbott's promises were as trustworthy as Newman's were before he was swept into power. Abbott, ran through his signature policies, and that they would be delivered by a strong ""trustworthy government"": a government that ""says what it means, and does what it says"".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fabrizio Carmignani, Associate Professor, Griffith Business School at Griffith University

It was an interesting debate, with a good variety of questions that covered some of the critical dimensions of the policy space. I had the impression that the strategy chosen by the two leaders in this debate reflected their respective position in the polls. Rudd is behind and therefore must attack.

Accordingly, he tried to challenge and put Abbot under pressure quite aggressively, especially at the beginning. Abbot, instead, stuck to his script, knowing that with his current lead in the polls the most important thing is to avoid big mistakes. Nevertheless, I think that Rudd tonight won. In particular, he managed to expose what is probably the main weakness of the Coalition: the lack of clarity on future budgetary decisions. The discussion on how to finance the parental leave plan is a clear example: Abbot was substantially unable or unwilling to provide details on how the full cost of the initiative would be covered.

More generally, Rudd was successful in stressing that the Coalition advances proposals that involve significant budget cuts and/or reallocation of resources, but it does not say exactly what is going to be cut. Given the precedent of the Newman government in Queensland, this is indeed something voters should be worried about.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

David Maguire, Associate Professor of Journalism and Media Management at Murdoch University

You can't fight Mr Rudd on showmanship and Mr Abbott didn't try to when the PM came out strong, pumped, animated and well in command of his non-verbal behavior. He seemed intent on executing an in-your-face strategy, at one point quite literally.

Abbott looked stilted in comparison as a result. He maintained the cool, calm and collected approach up to when he asked in the early stages of question time: ""does this guy ever shut-up?""

But after the initial flourishes, the two settled back into a more measured engagement, with more playing of the policy and strategy ball rather than the man. There was no knockout blow and no surprises in their answers to the wide range of questions. They traded tit-for-tat attacks on the records of previous governments and trotted out policy sound bites.

This was a more relaxed format and more conducive to the leaders displaying a modicum of personality, resulting in better viewing.

Marcus O'Donnell, Lecturer, Program Convenor, Journalism at University of Wollongong

There was nothing surprising in this debate that enlightened us on our electoral choices. So once again it came down to how it felt.

But maybe it's a game changer, by virtue of not changing the game, and the game being a lot harder to change after this half way point.

Rudd really need this to be a breakthrough moment and it didn't happen. He got no real traction even though he went hard at Abbott and demanded: What are you going to cut?

The PM had some good moments (""put your hands up if you earn $150,0000?"") where he really connected with the audience, but too often he looked uncomfortable and antsy. Abbott remained calm and looked surprisingly at ease.

Political strategist and former Blair and Gillard adviser John McTernan wrote yesterday that the election was a choice of two futures:

Kevin Rudd has to project a clear picture of Australia's future with Labor….Parties of the centre-left can only win with a compelling vision based on future and fairness.

This was the hymn Rudd opened with and came back to with a final chorus but for much of the night he was trying desperately to score his points by attacking Abbott's policies. Abbott didn't get tripped up.

Joseph Fernandez, Head of Department, Journalism at Curtin University

Rather oddly, the scorecard for the people's forum with the prime minister Kevin Rudd and opposition leader Tony Abbott dealt a verdict in which a non-party to the debate – journalists – came out losers.

As Mr Abbott put it: ""People One, Journos Nil"".

That remark drew this lament on the SMH's live feed on the debate: ""How very hurtful for us reptiles of the press"".

Unlike interrogation by journalists, however, the questions from the audience were predictable, covering planned cuts to public services, handouts to businesses, the paid parental leave scheme, the planned tax on savings deposits, WorkChoices, asylum seeker policy, environmental protection, 457 visas, housing affordability, and same sex marriage.

One question that broke the mould, however, concerned the poor calibre of some of the candidates fielded by the parties. Both leaders conceded this was a valid question.

News Corp as just about everyone in Australia knows is campaigning for a change of government. Yesterday Big News Network attended a State of the Nation briefing hosted by Roy Morgan Research at Parliament House in Sydney. They told us the real figures are 51%/49%.

In response to a question by Big News Network as to whether the News Corp campaign would impact on the election given the parties are so close, and whether in fact Rupert Murdoch would determine the election result, Gary Morgan said he didn't know, it was a sleeper.

Its unlikely to be the end of it as the defense will appeal at the very least the sentence which is likely to be harsh. The U.S. government has taken a particularly hard line.

109808052412959_571669892893437,"The government prosecutor in the trial of Brad Manning has rejected claims the United States Government held some responsibility in the army private's actions, in that it trained Manning, and gave him access to classified material when he was deployed to Iraq at the age of 21. 

The prosecutor also ruled out any responsibility for the army taking action when it learned Manning was under stress from gender-identity issues and was depressed at learning of the Coalition's actions in Iraq and their impact on Iraqis.

""Your Honor. The army is not on trial,"" Captain Morrow told the court. ""The command is not on trial. Mr. Adkins is not on trial. Behavioral health is not on trial. None of those entitles are individuals are responsible for what PFC Manning did.""

Judge Colonel Lind who has presided over the military tribunal is to sentence Manning on Wednesday, despite saying on Monday she would recess the court on Tuesday to commence her deliberations, inferring it may take considerable time. The U.S. Government says it wants a minimum 60 year sentence, a $100,000 fine and a dishonorable discharge at the end of the prison term.

In responding to concerns about Manning's mental health and personal issues he was facing, and evidence of this given by his defense team which suggested he should have been relieved, Morrow made the extraordinary claim, ""The army is not in the business of banning soldiers because of mental health issues.""

""It does not do the army any favors and it certainly does not do society any favors,"" he said.

""Seeking mental health treatment even in the military intelligence community is not an impediment to serving in the most junior soldiers.""

""Derogs are for serious allegations of misconduct, not for soldiers who have anger issues, who are struggling with their identities or who are gay,"" the U.S. Government prosecutor told the court.

Conceding testimony from a U.S. army officer that Manning was under severe mental distress, Captain Morrow said this was no excuse for Manning's actions.

""Captain Moulton testified that PFC Manning
was under severe emotional distress at the time of the offenses and stress impaired his thought process, though Commander Moulton never commented on the fact that stress could easily have been related to knowing deliberate violation of the law over the course of six months,"" he said.

""What Commander Moulton was unable to satisfactorily explain was what any of this has to do with stealing and transmitting classified government information over the course of six months.""

Captain Morrow, in his arguments to Judge Lind in the high profile military trial being conducted at Fort Meade, Maryland, asked the judge to disregard Manning's state of mind and mental health in appraising his ""crimes.""

""Ultimately, Your Honor, that's why you have
to divorce whatever issue PFC Manning apparently had from the crimes in this case. The United States is not disputing that PFC Manning may have been struggling with his gender identity. The government's only question is why that matters? What does that to do with PFC Manning's crimes, his intent, his intentional violation of the law, intentional violation of the law on repeated occasions? Why does the solution create a risk for everyone else? We can only say there were people in the army then, there are people now who are gay, who had strained relationships with significant others. There are people in the army now who might be struggling with gender  dysphoria. We take soldiers every day that are the product of broken homes with alcoholic parents, sometimes they're the victims of abuse. They join the military for a better life. They join the military for the GI bill. They join in the post adolescent stage of their life and they believe they can change the world for the better and that's true. When you're armed with serving the country, you're contributing to something larger than yourself. You're helping make the world a better place.""

""Sometimes soldiers can become disillusioned by war and sometimes soldiers become disillusioned by
Garrison rules,"" Captain Morrow continued. ""For every soldier PFC Manning didn't get along with there were thousands of fellow soldiers building schools, protecting civilians from sectarian
violence, contributing to humanitary aid missions in Pakistan and somewhere along the way PFC Manning forgot that, and it wasn't the military's fault, it wasn't the command's fault, it wasn't because he saw something horrible. It was because he had an agenda that was clear from the SIPRNET searches for information related to Wikileaks in late November 2009.""

""Your Honor, that in the end it doesn't matter. It
matters that he took an oath and he knowingly broke it,"" Captain Morrow told the court. ""He put others at risk through his deliberate actions and he impacted the mission.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/571669892893437/?type=3,2013-08-20 15:25:25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

O'Farrell met the CEO and principal shareholder  of the company, Australian Water, at around the time the Government awarded a contract to the company without tender, and against legal advice.

Australian Water is a private company formed in 1989. The company was originally known as the Rouse Hill Infrastructure Consortium and changed its name to Australian Water Holdings in 2008.

The NSW Government contract was awarded by the government entity Sydney Water, and is reportedly worth $100 million.

Australian Water's CEO Nick Di Girolamo is a friend of the NSW Premier. Both are members of the Wests Tigers football club.

Nick Di Girolamo is a donor to, and fundraiser for, O'Farrell's Liberal Party. He has also been a registered lobbyist

Sydney Water intended to put the contract to tender on September 1 2011. Just prior to this O'Farrell met with Di Girolamo in company with former finance minister Greg Pearce.

The tender was aborted soon after this meeting and negotiations then took place between Sydney Water and Australian Water. Four months later Sydney Water awarded Australian Water the contract.

A month before the contract was awarded Pearce appointed a friend of his (his wife's boss) to the board of Sydney Water.

Seven months on, in July 2012, Mr O'Farrell appointed Di Girolamo to the board of the Government's State Water Corporation for 3 years at $34,400 a year. This despite a ban on lobbyists being appointed to boards if they had lobbied on a related matter within the previous 12 months.

Australian Water, at the time the $100 million contract was awarded was majority owned by Di Girolamo, with another major shareholder being the O'Beid family. Eddie O'Beid Jnr. was on the Australian Water payroll for 18 months,

ICAC is understood to be investigating the Australian Water contract due to the shareholding of the O'Beid family which had been concealed as Eddie O'Beid was a member of parliament and Australian Water was bidding for government contracts. With Di Girolamo as CEO and Arthur Sinodinos, then NSW Liberal Party president (and now  Parliamentary Secretary to the Opposition Leader Tony Abbott), as Chairman of Australian Water, the company was well placed when O'Farrell's party came into government. The previous government led by Premier Kristina Keneally rejected Australian Water's overtures and had directed the contract be put to tender. 

ICAC has been investigating a number of contracts awarded by previous governments in relation to a number of identities of which Mr O'Beid is the best known. Last month the regulator found he and his son Moses among others had engaged in corrupt conduct in relation to their actions involving the Mount Penny mining tenement in the Bylong Valley.

The Australian Water contract is the first contract awarded by the O'Farrell government to be investigated by the ICAC.

109808052412959_568962973164129,"Week two of the Australian election campaign and all is quiet on the Murdoch press front.

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has stopped referring to the negative treatment he and his government is receiving from News Corp-owned newspapers throughout Australia.

This reportedly is on the advice of his advisers who say it is distracting from the object of promoting the government's record and its policies.

A debate on Monday night on Lateline between Deputy Prime Minister Albert Albanese and Communications spokesman Malcolm Turnbull didn't discuss Murdoch but was all about the National Broadcasting Network (NBN), reputedly the reason behind Murdoch's alleged sabotage of Rudd and his team.

Turnbull put up a good fight considering the horse-and-buggy nature of his technology compared to the ten-times faster broadband speeds being delivered under the NBN. Turnbull is tech-savvy and has a brilliant business mind so it was somewhat embarrassing to see him arguing against the NBN. The only advantage he tried to take was when he held up a pamphlet and accused Albanese of 'lying,' when he challenged the deputy PM's claim that the NBN is being made available free to all homes and businesses.

Albanese quickly put him straight on what most Australians know, and it would be somewhat incredulous if Malcolm didn't: that is that the connection to all homes and businesses will be free. At that point, if required, consumers can then buy broadband useage, in the same way that governments connect up electricity and then customers open accounts and pay for what they use.

Albanese won the argument hands-down on the technology front but his party is unlikely to win the election which means the future of the NBN is uncertain. Why is this?

Well one theory is that its all to do with Rupert Murdoch and his campaign to oust the Rudd (and previously the Gillard) government is an attempt to stop the NBN (in its present form). Michael Taylor of Cafe Whispers tackled this theory in an article the site published earlier this year.

""If you think the media have the knives out for the Government, then you're dead right,"" wrote Taylor saying he had spoken to a deep throat in the industry.

""If you think there's been a media campaign to discredit the Government, then you're on the mark,"" he wrote. ""It has not been your imagination. A source, a senior media executive I cannot name, has revealed the strategies used and the motivation behind them.""

He then sets out what his source said.

""The Murdoch media has been leaning to the right since the Whitlam days but the anti-Labor theme was really ramped up just before the 2010 election. The catalyst was Murdoch's luncheon with Tony Abbott, where the NBN must have been the main talking point as the very next day Abbott publicly announced that he'd rip up the NBN,"" the senior media executive told Taylor.

Apparently Abbott almost gave the game away by his over-eagerness, Taylor's source said. ""He pissed a few of us off by jumping too soon, thinking that people might tie the announcement to the meeting with Murdoch, which luckily they didn't. The NBN will affect Murdoch's profits, and let's be very clear on that, so the reason to back Abbott was clearly motivated by money for the media empire,"" Taylor's source told him.

He went on to say Tony Abbott was not easy for the media to sell, but they were doing their best.

""Tony Abbott is hard to sell as a politician, so we sell him as a person. He looks the goods as a loving family man or a fire fighter, but hopeless as a politician. He can't control his mouth. For example, yesterday he announced that he wouldn't rule out an alliance with the Greens. It's going to be hard for us in the media to sell this after a couple of years of trying as hard as possible to discredit the Greens.""

The media focus, according to the source, is to unsettle the Government and often this is done by creating fictitious leadership rumblings.

""Our main focus though is to try and unsettle the Government. Leadership spills are always a winner. You'd have noticed that the Rudd factor has been our agenda (again) since the Prime Minister (Gillard) announced the election date. Anybody with half a brain would know that a PM wouldn't announce an election date while there are leadership rumbles in their party. There weren't, so we had to create them, and it is working.""

""We are under instructions to hammer the leadership woes at every opportunity. When the results of a poll hit the press we take any opportunity to throw in a paragraph of how the results will add to speculation of a spill,"" Taylor's source continued.

""It's all because the emperor wants more money"".

Taylor asked the executive what he knew about the ABC's sudden right turn.

""Not a lot, but I've noticed that Tony Abbott is the first person they run to whenever they want to hear something about the Government, but that's about all. Oh yes, they seem to treat him as off-limits when it comes to any scrutiny, just as we do. Has Mark Scott whispered in his ear about funding should Abbott win? I don't know. Murdoch certainly has. Don't underestimate the power of money.""

""And Fairfax?"" he was asked.

""Probably the same motivation; money. We're not privy to what Tony Abbott has negotiated with the power brokers. It's just our job to bring about a change of Government. It helps the boss, so it helps us.""

When Taylor's story was published on Cafe Whispers in March, it raised a few eyebrows as well as attracting a number of sniggers. However, the appearance of a piece by Kieran Cummings the next day, 'Why Murdoch's media is gunning for your NBN' went to the heart of the matter. The article began:

""It seems a day doesn't go by where articles are being posted to News Limited (Murdoch) websites with nothing but negative spin for the NBN. Most, if not all, are founded on poorly constructed arguments that ignore technology and the reality. They all seem to point to one solution: anything the Coalition are saying they'll deploy.""

""While this does reek of patent bias amongst Murdoch's Australian arm, I feel this goes a little deeper than just wanting a Coalition government, but a fear of becoming obsolete in the age of IPTV (Internet Protocol Television)"".

And on March 2, anybody listening to Radio National's AM program would have heard the Shadow Minister for Communications and Broadband, Malcolm Turnbull say that

""there's an election in September; there's a reasonable chance there'll be a change of Government so in order to ensure that we have the flexibility to accommodate any changes in Government policy that might arise from a change of Government, [NBN Co] should not enter into contracts""

It was all coming together, wrote Taylor, and people were coming out of the woodwork. The senior media executive Michael Taylor spoke to seemingly had friends also prepared to come out about his employer:

""Yes, there is some breaking news Tony Abbott has lunch at News Ltd HQ every week.""

""Incredulous I asked the person to repeat it,"" said Taylor.

""EVERY week, in private,"" to discuss the latest ""Get Gillard"" strategies. No wonder there's such a seamless segue between what News writes and what Abbott parrots. He's dealing with the enemy. They're writing the script for him.""

""It's not a f--k-up. It's a f--g conspiracy.""

But, sources must remain confidential. ""I'm not going to tell you just who told us that bit of news. I have it on the very highest authority, however, given without hesitation in fact, volunteered by someone with no ostensible axe to grind, but should know it to be true. It's this person's job to know Abbott's movements, in detail,"" Taylor said.

Last week Rudd asked Abbott to confirm whether he had spoken to Murdoch about the NBN.

""I do from time to time talk to Rupert Murdoch. Have I ever spoken to Rupert Murdoch about the NBN? No I haven't,"" Abbott told a press conference last Thursday.

The spectacular fireworks and lighting display will coincide with the Royal Australian Navy's International Fleet Review which will commemorate the arrival of the first RAN Fleet in 1913. The display will be a highly complex and choreographed fireworks, projection, lighting and live action show, centered on Sydney Harbour and the Sydney Opera House. It will see the harbour come alive as never before, in a 30-minute show celebrating over a hundred years of the RAN, and in particular commemorating the RAN's original seven warships that arrived in Sydney Harbour in 1913. The establishment of the RAN was to give Australia its own naval defense force, and was believed at the time to be a nation-breaking event, Lieutenant Commander Desmond Woods told members of the Kings Cross Rotary Club this week. ""Little did they know a year later Australia would be at war and the navy's fleet would be taking a large part,"" he said. In the spectacular show planned for October fireworks will be launched from city rooftops, barge positions from the vicinity of Cockatoo Island to east of Fort Denison, the Harbour Bridge road deck, and for the first time ever, from the decks of RAN warships. This will all be joined by a light show from land, warships and Harbour Bridge positions, as well as a full projection show, telling the history of the Navy. The projection show will be seen on both sides of the Opera House sails, the eastern side of the Harbour Bridge pylons and the roof of the Australian National Maritime Museum in Darling Harbour. Flyovers by Navy and Air Force aircraft will also feature. The Spectacular will be visible across the harbour for this once-in-a-lifetime event. It will also be telecast live on Australia's public broadcaster ABC1. The International Fleet Review will get underway with a tall ships entry to Sydney Harbour on Thursday, 3 October, followed by a combined warships fleet entry on Friday, 4 October, when Australia's Governor-General will welcome the fleet from Bradley's Head. At the end of the fleet entry, there will be a total of 58 warships and tall ships anchored or berthed in and around Sydney Harbour. Saturday, 5 October will see the assembled Fleet ceremonially Reviewed by the Governor-General, followed by military aircraft displays, and will culminate in the early evening with the half-hour fireworks and light show Spectacular. More than forty warships and 19 tall ships, plus 8,000 naval personnel from 19 nations, will take part in the International Fleet Review, which is being staged in cooperation with the NSW Government and City of Sydney Council.

109808052412959_568594086534351,"Talk about The Comeback Spy. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, aka Bandar Bush (for Dubya he was like family), spectacularly resurfaced after one year in speculation-drenched limbo (was he or was he not dead, following an assassination attempt in July last year). And he was back in the limelight no less than in a face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Saudi King Abdullah, to quote Bob Dylan, ""is not busy being born, he's busy dying"". At least he was able to pick up a pen and recently appoint Bandar as head of the Saudi General Intelligence Directorate; thus in charge of the joint US-Saudi master plan for Syria. The four-hour meeting between Bandar Bush and Vlad the Hammer by now has acquired mythic status. Essentially, according to diplomatic leaks, Bandar asked Vlad to drop Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and forget about blocking a possible UN Security Council resolution on a no-fly zone (as if Moscow would ever allow a replay of UN resolution 1973 against Libya). In return the House of Saud would buy loads of Russian weapons. Vlad, predictably, was not impressed. Not even when Bandar brazenly insisted that whatever form a post-Assad situation would take, the Saudis will be ""completely"" in control. Vlad - and Russian intelligence - already knew it. But then Bandar went over the top, promising that Saudi Arabia would not allow any Gulf Cooperation Council member country - as in Qatar - to invest in Pipelineistan across Syria to sell natural gas to Europe and thus damage Russian - as in Gazprom's - interests. When Bandar saw he was going nowhere, he reverted to his fallback position; the only way out in Syria is war - and Moscow should forget about the perennially postponed Geneva II peace conference because the ""rebels"" will be a no show. Once again, Vlad did not need a reminder that the Saudis - in ""cooperation"" with Washington - have now taken over the ""rebel"" galaxy. Qatar has been confined to a (expensive) dustbin, as Vijay Prashad alludes to here. This is part of Washington's plan - if there is one - to isolate the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and its shady jihadi ramifications/connections. Wily Bandar, for his part, is not a fool to believe his own propaganda; he knows Moscow has more complex geostrategic interests other than just keeping Syria as a weapons client. And he might have suspected that Moscow simply does not bother with Gulf competition in Pipelineistan targeting European markets. It's instructive to remember that in 2009, Damascus did not sign an agreement with Qatar for a pipeline via Syria; but they did sign the memorandum of understanding last year for the US$10 billion Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline. So the point is for Damascus, the deal with Iran was much better; and if the pipeline is ever built Gazprom may even be part of it, in infrastructure and distribution. What Moscow has concluded is that Gazprom won't lose its energy grip over Europe to the benefit of Qatari natural gas. A case can be made that Gazprom holds more power over the distressed, decaying, virtually insolvent eurozone than the European Central Bank (ECB). What Vlad does fear is a potential post-Assad utter chaos, to be fully exploited by Salafi-jihadis. It's never enough to remember that from Aleppo to Grozny it's roughly 900 kilometers. The next stop for the Global Jihad in Syria would be the Caucasus. And that's where Bandar Bush and Vlad the Hammer might converge; their mutual strategic interest is to reign in jihadis - although Bandar, in fact, is also weaponizing them. Moscow won't drop Damascus. Period. At the same time, as Bandar threatened, Geneva II seems more unlikely to happen than the Obama administration ceasing to drone Yemen to death. As Asia Times Online has extensively reported, the name of the game, in practice, remains Syria as the new Afghanistan, with the House of Saud in control of all aspects of jihad (with Washington ""leading from behind""). Deadly historic irony also applies; instead of clashing with the Soviet Union, now the Saudis clash with the Russian federation. Bandar is simultaneously the new Weaponizer-in-Chief, as well as Liberator-in-Chief of Syria. The Comeback Spy is not accounting for future, inevitable, ghastly blowback; what's alarming is that the Obama administration is right behind him. Bandar's visit to Moscow simply could not have happened without a green light from Washington. So what's the (muddled) master plan? The Obama administration seems to believe in a remixed Sykes-Picot - almost a century after the original. The problem is they are clueless on how to configure the new zones of influence. Meanwhile, they're letting the Saudis do the heavy lifting. The first step was to eliminate Qatar from the picture. It's astonishing how fast the emirate, up to two months ago a prospective mini-superpower, now has been reduced to less than an afterthought. Yet Bandar by now may have seen the writing on the (bloody) wall; Bashar al-Assad will be in power until the 2014 elections in Syria, and may even win those elections. The Saudis might accept a form of compensation in Lebanon, with their protege, the cosmically incompetent Saad al-Hariri, back in power in a coalition government including the political branch of Hezbollah - not the other one which the European poodles branded ""terrorist"". This also seems unlikely. So what is Bandar the Liberator to do? Well, he can always direct his private jet to Dallas and liberate his sorrows in a sea of single malt, provided by the House of Dubya.

109808052412959_567483113312115,"Australian Prime minister Kevin Rudd and opposition leader Tony Abbott have faced off in the first televised leaders' debate of the 2013 election campaign.

In a debate largely framed by the economic issues, Rudd pressed Abbott on his promise not to raise the Goods and Services Tax (GST), while Abbott accused the Rudd government of ""killing"" the resources boom through policy measures such as the mining and carbon taxes.

On the vexed issue of asylum seekers, Rudd denied that dismantling the Pacific Solution of offshore processing was a mistake, but instead claimed that changing international circumstances  such as a civil war in Sri Lanka  were the cause of a dramatic influx in the number of arrivals by boat.

Rudd also promised that a bill to recognise same-sex marriage would be introduced to parliament in the first 100 days if an ALP government was returned.

The Conversation's experts were watching the debate. Their comments follow.

Tom Clark, Senior Lecturer in Communication at Victoria University:

This feels like a disappointing night out for Kevin Rudd. The government has been losing popular momentum for several days. A turnaround in the opinion polls has unsettled the Labor team, and they really wanted a win to get their campaign, er, moving forward.

Quite unlike the opening salvos a week ago, Tony Abbott was the more energetic contender. Without getting overbearing in his swagger or letting his aggression turn personal, he was consistently more switched on than Rudd.

Rudd, so bubbly a week ago, was showing little of that blithe feistiness in the debate. He did not engage directly with Abbott, or with anything that Abbott had raised, until 47 minutes into the debate. That was when he finally warmed up to the moment, but I suspect it was far too late for the bored denizens of voterland.

This points to a broader problem with the campaign. Rudd's fairly lightweight engagement with ""the facts on the ground"" clearly struggles to meet Abbott's hard hitting disregard for them.

Time is steadily leaking away for this federal government. It is not a violent rush right now, but the flow may get faster over the days ahead.

Roy Green, Dean of UTS Business School and University of Technology, Sydney:

The fundamental appeal of Kevin Rudd since his restoration as prime minister has been his ability to combine a more realistic assessment of Australia's post-mining boom predicament with a sense of hope and optimism about how we might tackle it. While this repositioning of the Labor government initially wrong-footed Tony Abbott, reducing the scope for ""relentless negativity"", its success in an election context depends on a clear and credible economic policy framework.

The problem for Labor is that their policy framework locked in Howard government tax cuts of A$169 billion from 2005-06. Even if the tax/GDP ratio had been held at the 23.7% operating at the time of the 2007 election, it is unlikely we would now be debating budget deficits as we would not have one. We might instead be taking advantage of historically low interest rates to fund increased investment in research and innovation, and to prepare for a more internationally competitive, diversified knowledge-based economy.

However, last night's debate focused on which party was better placed to fund ambitious commitments within a timetable for returning to budget surplus, as the tax take recedes before their eyes. The fact is that neither party can predict if and when the budget will return to surplus within a specified period. Paradoxically every attempt to do so by reducing public expenditure will only compound the problem by dampening economic activity still further, counteracting the effect of low interest rates.

Australia's major challenge in the years ahead is to address the low growth scenario set out by the Reserve Bank in its latest quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy, as result of falling terms of trade, a global downturn and the failure over a 15 year period to identify and capitalise on future areas of technological change and innovation. Of course, there are some shining examples of entrepreneurial success, and of smart policy initiatives such as Enterprise Connect and the new Innovation Precincts program, but a structural deterioration in our productivity performance has been masked by the temporary windfall gains of the commodity boom.

In this election campaign, the parties should be judged by their capacity to meet the challenge of long-term growth and jobs, and the health and education needs of a changing population, rather than an artificially imposed, counter-productive budget surplus commitment. In recent years, there have been some path-breaking reports on our vision of the future as an advanced economy in the fastest growing region of the world, such as Australia in the Asian Century. Do Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott share this vision? On the evidence of last night's debate, it is very hard to tell.

Natalie Mast, Senior Policy Analyst at University of Western Australia:

Unable to choose between Chanel 9's ""worm"" and 7's ""viewers' vote"" options, this commentary is based on my viewing of the debate via ABC24, and thus I am somewhat ignorant as to how the punters viewed the performance of either leader.

I am giving the first round of this pretty dull debate to Rudd. That said, I don't think Abbott was damaged in the debate, and so he is likely to emerge only slightly bruised.

If this were a soccer match I'd say it seemed that Kevin Rudd had possession of the ball at least 65% of the time. The warning bell definitely rang more often for Rudd than Abbott, who seemed willing to wrap up answers before his time expired.

Both leaders appeared nervous, but overall Rudd has a smoother delivery than Abbott, and I think he was aided by his hand movements, which suggest an effort to explain a multi-faceted argument, even when the argument ends in a three-word slogan.

If I can digress and be shallow for a moment, someone should be sacked for allowing Tony Abbott to face the nation with a crooked tie.

There are a few reasons why I thought Rudd won the debate. Despite the turmoil of the last Parliament, and the fact the he was prime minister for only the last sitting day, Rudd was able to provide a pretty positive story about what the Labor government has delivered over the last six years:

No recession during the GFC
Nearly a million new jobs
Over 100,000 additional students at University
National Broadband Network
National Insurance Scheme

Rudd managed to produce a very nice link to NBN and its role in Aged Care, especially for caring for people in their own homes, illustrating a non-business/non-high speed downloading benefit of the infrastructure.

Rudd also took a stand and declared that within the first 100 days a vote on same sex marriage will be held and it will be a conscious vote for the ALP. This was in contrast to Abbott, who declared it an important issue, but made it clear he wouldn't be bringing it to the floor of the Parliament anytime soon. Rudd looked like a prime minister in this moment and a politician of conviction.

Without the benefit of being in power over the last six years, Abbott lacks the ability to cherry pick good news items. That said, during his closing remarks Abbott referred to his plans for the country, which the Liberal Party has developed over a number of years.

At the end of this debate, I am not sure how much more the Australian public would know about the details of those plans. Again, we heard the stock standard phrases ""Stop the Boats"", ""Scrap the Carbon Tax"" etc, none of which sound particularly positive, probably because they've become soundbites used to attack the government over a number of years.

Abbott needs some big picture showpiece: too bad he has refused to fund any form of suburban rail, there's nothing like a fast train or light rail to capture the imagination of the voting public.

Stephanie Brookes, Lecturer, School of Journalism, Australian and Indigenous Studies at Monash University:

""We want this to be a genuine debate,"" moderator David Speers insisted in the opening moments of last night's broadcast. ""A genuine contest of visions."" Watching this first election debate, however, there was little in the way of vision from either side.

In his opening statement, the prime minister positioned himself as the inheritor of the Labor legacy and reached out to the young ""dynamos of the future"". Tony Abbott, self-consciously looking down the barrel of the camera, reassured us that this election is about ""the people of Australia"".

But as the debate wore on, there was little to catch the imagination, create momentum or keep the audience engaged. The prospect of questions being taken from social media did not eventuate. The broadcast itself was dull, the set and structure evoking Australia's first election debates in the 1980s.

Tony Abbott spoke slowly and clearly (too much so, at times). While the prime minister was on edge from the outset, his opponent seemed more relaxed. Rudd rustled his papers, Abbott stalled for time.  Both were frequently interrupted by the assiduous time-keeper's bell.

The candidates needed to outline a clear narrative of the nation's future that would resonate with voters. Mired down in details and quibbling over small issues, there were no risks taken  and little ground won.

Zareh Ghazarian, Lecturer, School of Political and Social Inquiry at Monash University:

The leaders' debate is a relatively new phenomenon in Australian politics, with the first occurring in 1984 between Labor prime minister Bob Hawke and opposition leader Andrew Peacock. The idea is borrowed from the system in the United States where presidential debates have been a feature since 1960. The format makes greater sense in presidential systems where voters directly elect their head of government. In the Australian case, leaders' debates serve to reinforce policies and principles the parties wish to pursue as well as test how a leader performs under pressure.

The candidates are meticulously prepared and, even if they have a mental blank, can rely on their ""stump speech"" (a message or broad idea that they've already aired many times before) to get them through tricky situations.

In this context, the debate between Rudd and Abbott served few surprises. Both leaders sought to remain controlled and statesman like. Rudd once again proved to be a calm and articulate speaker. He successfully balanced his attacks on the opposition with reference to his positive policies. Abbott also performed effectively and was obviously guided by the principle of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".

Abbott was slightly less formal in tone and kept attacking the government's performance and reaffirmed the Coalition's broad ideas that have proven popular with the electorate over the last three years. Both leaders performed strongly in the tactical battle of attacking their opponent and defending their positions when necessary.

While there will be disagreements about who ""won"" the debate (and partisans will have clear views about who they feel did best), it did, at the very least, allow both leaders to be viewed in their raw and unedited states. Whether this will have any impact on voters' intentions and the remaining campaign is yet to be seen.

Mark Rolfe, Lecturer, School of Social Sciences and International Studies at University of New South Wales:

We've all encountered the game six degrees of separation, particularly how many steps it takes to get to Kevin Bacon.

Well now there is a new game: how many steps does it take Kevin or Tony to get back to their slogans.

Aged care? No problem for Tony. Although he quickly admitted there were no big differences with the government in matters of aged care, he still insisted that cutting paperwork was the general panacea for problems in that sector. Magically, it would release many dollars for caring for old folk. After all we're a great country full of great people. The nature of the new economy? Revive the building commission, which seemed to be a magic pudding for a whole lot of problems now afflicting Australia. I didn't realise the magic that stopped when Julia killed it!

Badgerys Creek airport? No problem for Kevin. After stuff about Workchoices to get his last word to Abbott's previous answer, he turned to electricity gouging, infrastructure, NBN, and it's all a matter for Albo.

Both men wanted to appropriate certain areas as their strengths. So for Abbott ""we invented offshore processing""; a ready team in waiting, with a ready plan to cut spending, previous experience. For Rudd it was health, education, NDIS, saving the country from the GFC, and climate change.

So for both men their attempts were to reinforce (ad nauseum) their messages that have been around for months now, probably with the old nostrum in mind that when voters are starting to vomit, that's when you've got their attention. So we heard Kevin so many eggs in one basket that it must have please the chook industry.

Hard questions  such as Badgerys Creek; Ken Henry's view that governments regardless of colour are facing structural deficits that need to be addressed by both spending and revenue decisions; how to raise productivity; how to deal with international agreements that increase cuts in carbon emissions; spending on aged care for an aging population; about how the New Economy of the future will be sustained  all these and more were batted off to the keeper.

Important issues were raised but neither man wanted to be pressed about these harder issues, especially Abbott on plans for cutting spending or for assurances about the GST. They are similar on matters of size of government  Rudd repeated statistics used many times elsewhere  but they had to demonstrate vast differences there.

Certainly Rudd did wish to add statistics to treat people seriously and complications such as the push factors that drive asylum seekers. And Abbott wanted to ""keep it simple stupid"" with repetition of slogans. Complex issues like productivity and push factors are too hard to deal with in such fora.

But the verdict is that this was just positioning after the first week after the government lost some of its direction. Neither man wished to expose too much so early in the campaign. But both wished to display their sympathies and support for families doing it tough, even though statistics show the rises in income of many households is ahead the rises in expenditure over the last years.

109808052412959_566880633372363,"Rupert Murdoch's Australian newspapers are stepping up their campaign to oust Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his ALP government. On Saturday the group's most influential newspaper The Daily Telegraph ran a triple-page spread headlined ""HERO or PSYCHO?"" ""An ego-driven, secretive, control freak narcissist or just a man on a mission,"" was the sub-headline. Readers could have been left wondering whether in fact the article was about Rudd, or about the newspaper's proprietor Rupert Murdoch. Of course it was about the Aussie PM. There was his large photo with him adjusting his spectacles. And of course the byline: Andrew Carswell psychoanalyses Kevin Rudd. So readers are then put through three pages of Carswell's analysis of Rudd's personality and behaviour, trying to draw comparisons with traits of a psychopath. As the basis for his ""story"" he uses a remark made on Twitter one-and-a-half-years ago by Steve Gibbons in which he referred to the Australian prime minister as such notwithstanding, as Carswell says, ""Gibbons is a man who is routinely and rightly pilloried for making crude, stupid and nasty remarks in the name of cheap publicity."" Well it seems Carswell himself and his employer, are happy to be a tool of that 'cheap publicity,' long after the remark was tweeted. ""So is it true? Is the man running this country really a psychopath?"" asks Carswell. Using as his experts on the subject psychotherapist John Clarke, who says between 1% and 3% of all Australians ""could be certifiably deemed psychopathic,"" anthropologist Stephen Juan who suggests one in ten companies are headed by a corporate psychopath, criminal mind expert Steve van Aperen who claims one of the misconceptions about psychopathy is that people think a psychopath goes out and kills people. The Telegraph reporter also refers to a 'psychopathy checklist' put together by Canadian criminal psychologist and FBI adviser Robert D Hare twenty years ago. Drawing an even wider bow he quotes research by Western Sydney University professor Peter Jonason who claims while Machiavellianism is apolitical in its nature, there is a ""left-leaning bias for those individuals high on psychopathy."" Readers are left with a series of assertions and questions all aimed to portray Rudd as a psychopath: 'It seems psychopaths are everywhere, and they are more likely to wear a suit and tie, than carry a bloodied weapon or be pointing a sawn-off shotgun.' Those deemed psychopathic are very much aware of it, and are attempting to control it. ""The corporate psychopath is the type of psychopath that gets into politics because they are usually exceedingly ego-oriented - it is all about them. So even when they get criticism, it is still all about them"" (Anthropologist Stephen Juan). ""There are certainly many undiagnosed psychopaths in business and politics"" (criminal mind expert Steve van Aperen). ""...often people get confused between the terms psychopath and psychotic, which makes people less inclined to label someone as the former and thus grouping them with such fiends as Ivan Milat, Charles Manson or Martin Bryant"" (Juan). ""The corporate psychopath is the type of psychopath that gets into politics because they are usually exceedingly ego-oriented - it is all about them. So even when they get criticism, it is still all about them"" (Juan). ""They love the centre of attention. Good or bad they see themselves being the centre of the universe"" (Juan). ""They are the great users, the great manipulators, they often have aides and underlings do work for them, and expect blind loyalty but they don't give loyalty in return. They use everyone for gain"" (Juan). ""Everything is about them. If you talk to them in a conversation about your issues, they will immediately turn it around to their issues. It's as if no one exists other than them"" (Juan). ""They climb the corporate ladder very effectively, they are often very charming and articulate, often very good looking which they use to their advantage"" (Juan). It is the only thing they exist for. Themselves. They can't be trusted, they will lie to your face and deny they have when they are caught. They never own up to their own actions, they are always blaming others. They are polar opposites in public and private, with the former a place for their charm offensive to be exercised, and the latter a dark place of indifference and loathing (No attribution). It's the psychopath's modus operandi; a persona that they can't escape from, a disguise that soon becomes arduous to hide (No attribution). 'Its (psychopathy checklist by Canadian criminal psychologist and FBI adviser Robert D Hare)  defined set of traits include impulsiveness, superficial charm, grandiosity, callousness, manipulative, lack of remorse or guilt, propensity to blame others, poor behavioural control, egocentric.' Whether unfairly or resoundingly just, Kevin Rudd's name has oft been etched beside those traits, by members of his own camp or from across enemy lines. His impulsiveness is well documented, from rushed decision making done without proper consultation with colleagues or stakeholders, to his ""policies on the run"" such as the changes to the Fringe Benefit Tax system that crack down on salary-sacrificed cars, to the detriment of the struggling car industry (Carswell). On these rash methods, he is internationally renowned (Carswell). ""He makes snap announcements without consulting other countries or within the Australian government"" (Unnamed U.S. Embassy official). ""I mean this guy is a once-in-a-century egomaniac"" (Former ALP leader Mark Latham). Carswell points to a News Corp poll of 30,000 voters last month where voters were given a list of words to describe Rudd. The results were stark sasy The Daily Telegraph reporter: smug, manipulative and egotistical. Claude Minisini spent 15 years within the FBI's behavioural science division. In his opinion, Kevin Rudd is your classic organisational psychopath. Ticks every box, allegedly, wrote Carswell in his article on Saturday. ""One of the traits of a psychopath is a lack of remorse. Has Kevin Rudd shown that? In relation to the pink batts saga, has he ever come out and said sorry to individuals for him making that bad decision? The answer is no,"" Ms Minisini said. ""Is he indifferent, or does he rationalise having hurt or mistreated someone else? I suppose he ticks that box too. I would certainly say that he is impulsive. Has he failed to adequately plan ahead? I suppose he ticks that box too. Is he irritable and aggressive? Yes, he probably ticks that one"" ""There would be some people that would say that he is (a psychopath), given in his early administration, many of his aides left because he was difficult to work with"" (Yuan). ""You can see these traits in many politicians, not just Kevin Rudd. He has tendencies that are very egotistical, ego centred, but is it only about him? That is the real issue"" (Yuan). Oxford University research psychologist Kevin Dutton, Carswell says, is another believer that psychopaths can actually lead incredibly successful lives. ""When psychologists talk about psychopaths, what we're referring to are people who have a distinct set of personality characteristics, which include things like ruthlessness, fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, persuasiveness and a lack of conscience and empathy,"" he said. The article goes on. Inevitably readers are left with the conclusion Rudd is a psychopath. The experts however fell short of that claim. ""While Rudd may exhibit some psychopathic tendencies, it is near impossible for an outsider to officially determine,"" Juan was quoted a saying. ""They would have to get to the bottom of their motivations,"" he said. ""There would be some people that would say that he is (a psychopath), given in his early administration, many of his aides left because he was difficult to work with."" ""You can see these traits in many politicians, not just Kevin Rudd. He has tendencies that are very egotistical, ego centred, but is it only about him? That is the real issue."" said Juan. Indeed Carswell has portrayed many who would partly or wholly align with the traits of a psycho. The way Carswell has set out his article he could for example be talking about his bosses, particularly News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch. He could be talking about Col Allan, the New York Post editor who is Mr Murdoch's envoy to the Australian newspapers on  a mission apparently to destroy Kevin Rudd, which it must be said he is doing a good job of with articles like these. Carswell quotes Emory University's Scott Lilienfeld's who says, ""Some psychopathic traits, such as interpersonal dominance, persuasiveness and venturesomeness, may be conducive to acquiring positions of political power and to successful leadership."" A research paper by Lilienfield  put Winston Churchill and Lyndon Johnson as perfect case studies, claiming both possessed very real characteristics of a psychopath, but who ""managed to parlay these traits into political success."" What Carswell didn't relay was perhaps a good summing up of his 'essay,' which is what Oxford University research psychologist Kevin Dutton said in the same Q&A article from Time that Carswell lifted his quote from when asked: ""Would you agree that without psychopathic traits, we might lose a lot of leaders and heroes?"" Dutton replied, ""There's always been a need for risk-takers in society and a need for ruthlessness, charm, charisma and a need for mental toughness and emotional detachment."" ""All of these traits are on a spectrum, just as there exists no official division  between someone who plays the piano well and a concert pianist. One individual might be ruthless and fearless, but not have a lack of conscience,"" he said. ""If you've got loads of these traits all turned up to max, you're going to overload the circuits [and be a dangerous psychopath]."" ""But you wouldn't be anywhere near dangerous if some were high and some low,"" said Dutton. ""Depending on context, you're talking different proportions that might be quite functionally adapted to whatever professional field of endeavour you might be working in. [At extremely high levels], you might have problems but if turn those down, you might find people who are better than normal in certain aspects.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/566880633372363/?type=3,2013-08-10 16:25:28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_566075320119561,"The vicious attack by media mogul Rupert Murdoch on Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd accelerated on Thursday. Murdoch's most influential newspaper The Daily Telegraph portrayed Rudd and the deputy prime minister in Nazi uniforms comparing them to characters of the 1960s/70s sit-com Hogan's Heroes. Kevin Rudd is depicted as the hapless Colonel Klink, who as commandant of a fictitious prisoner of war camp, was a main character in the series. Deputy Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is portrayed as Klink's deputy, Sergeant Schultz. Craig Thomson, a New Zealander and former health union official who is an Independent member of the Australian parliament (formerly a member of Rudd's ALP) and who is facing fraud charges relating to his time with the Health Services Union is also in the photo montage - as Colonel Hogan, the hero of the TV series. The Telegraph story hinges on Albanese having drinks with Thomson, with the basic theme that the meeting had ""undermined Kevin Rudd's claims he is forging 'a new way' for the ALP. It is not the first time News Corp newspapers have portrayed public figures in Nazi dress. In 2005, the media group's UK newspaper The Sun was provided with a photo of Prince Harry wearing a swastika armband to a friend's costume party. It was a private function which was also attended by Prince William. That should have been the end of it. The Sun however splashed the photo on its front page with the headline ""Harry the Nazi"" in text so big it occupied about two thirds of the page. The story was then picked up by almost every news media outlet around the world with the photo appearing in all major newspapers and on TV channels across the globe. While many around the world chastised the 20-year old Harry, not a word was said about Murdoch who had jumped on a chance to profit from the young prince's mistake and was more responsible than anyone for the photo's global exposure. In response to the Murdoch campaign against the Labor government, Kevin Rudd has questioned the media mogul's motivation suggesting it may have something to do with his government's rolling-out of the NBN (National Broadband Network) which some say will be a threat to Foxtel, 50% owned by News Corp. Murdoch has denied this saying the NBN will be advantageous for Foxtel. On Friday News Corp's national newspaper The Australian ran a front page story headlined, ""NBN is good for business: Foxtel unpicks PM's conspiracy theory."" Warlier in the week (Wednesday) News Corp issued a statement saying, ""Any suggestion that the editorial position of our newspapers is based upon the commercial interests of Foxtel demonstrates a complete ignorance of both our business and of Foxtel."" Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says he has never talked to Murdoch about the NBN. ""Have I ever spoken to Rupert Murdoch about the NBN? No I haven't, no I haven't,"" he told a press conference in Tasmania where he was campaigning on Thursday. ""Senior politicians have to accept that sometimes media outlets will back them and sometimes they won't,"" he added. Opposition communications spokesman Malcolm Turnbull, who has long championed the Packer and Murdoch families 'entitlement' to share the Australian media landscape, has been a little more circumspect. Asked whether he had discussed the coalition's policy on the NBN Turnbull replied, ""I haven't discussed it with him in those terms, in terms of our specific policy,"" he said. ""But I can tell you that Murdoch's views are nothing special,"" he added.

109808052412959_564743550252738,"(Big News Network) SYDNEY - ""Should I not be prime minister by the end of this campaign let there be no doubt that my challenger will be a puppet of Rupert Murdoch. That is the reality, that is the choice at stake,"" Rudd said. This is not a statement made by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd but could have been. This in fact is a statement made by former NSW Premier Nathan Rees on December 3 2009 and he wasn't talking about Rupert Murdoch, he was talking about Eddie O'Beid. O'Beid has long since fallen from grace after nearly two decades of manipulating leader leadership elections and candidate pre-selections across New South Wales, and then using those who benefited from those political favours to win concessions for his own commercial interests, which blossomed during his time at the helm as the state's power broker and king maker. Rupert Murdoch has a similar history of backing those who bend his way. He has been on the end of some spectacular concessions by premiers and prime ministers, who in turn have benefited from his patronage. The September 7 2013 Federal election however marks a new turn for the Murdoch press. Never has a media proprietor of such magnitude so brazenly come out and attacked a sitting government or an opposition to the extent Murdoch has struck out this time at Kevin Rudd's Labor Government. News Corporation's campaign kicked into high-gear on Saturday with negative headlines and stories emblazoned across the two thirds of Australian newspapers the media giant owns. Following the announcement of the election result on Sunday, Murdoch newspapers upped the ante. Australia's most influential daily newspaper, read by the largest number of readers in the country awoke on Monday to a demand from Murdoch to 'KICK THIS MOB OUT.' (This) ""is a classic example of Murdoch's penchant for political character assassination. There is not the slightest attempt to conceal his agenda. It is blatant, bold and belligerent. And it confirms yet again the way in which he links political interventions to his commercial desires,"" The Guardian said in a front page article published Tuesday. ""He (Murdoch) is a past master at this business and appears to have chosen one of his most loyal editorial lieutenants to oversee what is certain to be an uninhibited five-week assault on Rudd and his Labor colleagues."" The Guardian, as other non-Murdoch newspapers are talking about, was referring to Col Allan, a former Daily Telegraph editor who for some years has been Murdoch's head man at his New York Post newspaper. He is the person who set-up Rudd on a visit to New York taking him to a strip club, only to have the story of it published at a later time in the Murdoch newspaper network. 
Allan is known among colleagues as Col Pot, comparing him to the ruthless dictator who eradicated 25% of his countrymen when he ruled Cambodia (formerly Kampuchea) as leader of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s. Murdoch has long waged a war against the Rudd (and Gillard) government after it set up the National Broadband Network (NBN) which the media mogul sees as a threat to the profitability of Foxtel, half-owned by News Corp. 
Murdoch is said to be fearful too of Labor's likelihood of setting up a press regulatory body similar to ACMA which oversees the broadcasting and television industries. The Daily Telegraph headline of Monday has caused surprise in some circles, and has resulted in widespread media comment including being the starting topic on QandA on Monday night. ""I think Australians are a bit smarter than looking at that headline and going oh well, that must be right. They will look for what the agenda is behind the headline,"" Deputy Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday. 
""It's not terribly subtle and in terms of the media, I reckon Telegraph readers will be picking that up and thinking, 'Well I deserve better than that as a Telegraph reader'. That is an extraordinary intervention on day one of an election campaign.""
The Daily Telegraph in an editorial on Monday titled ""Consign Rudd to the bin of history"" defended its position, after noting the newspaper endorsed Kevin Rudd in the 2007 election. ""It is traditional for newspapers to deliver their verdict on the eve of the election, but we would like to offer our judgement in a calm and measured way now, unaffected by the relentless spin and sloganeering which is about to cloud the coming campaign,"" the editorial said. ""At the same time we will place Coalition policies under exactly the same level of scrutiny,"" The Daily Telegraph editorial added. Rupert Murdoch may well be demanding the votes of readers of The Daily Telegraph and his other newspapers around Australia. He doesn't have a vote himself. Facing a ban on foreigners owning television assets in the United States, Rupert Murdoch to advance his commercial interests in 1985 surrendered his Australian citizenship and became a naturalised U.S. citizen. (The following year Murdoch's company established Fox which now reaches 96% of households in the United States).",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/564743550252738/?type=3,2013-08-05 18:18:25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_563597150367378,"The honeymoon for Kevin Rudd and Australia's Labor Government is over.  Rupert Murdoch's network of Australian newspapers has thrown down the gauntlet, just as they have in past years. August 3 2013 is the day. The day the Murdoch-controlled newspapers kicks off their campaign to boot Rudd out of the lodge. On Saturday August 3 almost half the front page of The Daily Telegraph is taken up with three words ""Price of Labor."" In large text underneath in red are the words ""Another huge budget shambles…now we're $30b in the red."" A photo of a hapless looking Rudd accompanies the so-called story. Only it's not a story, it's a teaser with a paragraph about ""Australia haemorrhaging under a $22 billion budget blowout in 80 days, and warnings of decade-high unemployment."" The teaser takes readers to pages 4 and 5 where the News Corp strategy is laid out with a string of negative articles. The largest blazoned by a huge headline in capital letters across the two pages is titled, ""LABOR'S DEBT AND JOBS CRISIS."" Other headlines include, ""Soaring costs are big issue for voters,"" ""Debt pushes us to edge of the fiscal cliff by Christmas,"" ""Stop being childish and start running the country properly,"" and ""No safety in these numbers for  Rudd."" That was just pages 4 and 5. Elsewhere in the newspaper we see, ""Sending refugees to PNG costs $1b,"" and the lead story in the Business section, ""Elect Rudd if you want higher taxes and deficits."" The second most prominent story on the page is, ""Muddled strategy threatens prosperity."" On the opinion page is a photo of Treasurer Chris Bowen gritting his teeth and a large opinion piece headlined, ""Mr Tough Guy, eh?"" Adjacent to that is the newspaper's editorial for the day, attacking the Labor Government. The headline is, ""Labor leading us into a black hole."" It blasts the government over its economic forecasts, how they've changed estimates since the May budget and it sends up Bowen's characterisation that Australia is not in crisis but is in transition mode, and that it needs careful economic management. The Telegraph is the most influential  daily newspaper in Australia's biggest state. It normally focuses on human interest stories, sport and entertainment. Its readers must be left wondering why they're being inundated with negative stories about the economy and the government. Well they should get used to it. This is the first of a barrage of articles, headlines and editorials to come in Murdoch's quest to rid itself of the Australian government. Rupert Murdoch wants and needs every Daily Telegraph reader's vote. News Corp wants a government that suits its commercial interests and it clearly intends to influence its readers in every way it can. What has appeared in The Daily Telegraph on August 3 is appearing in one form or another in every Murdoch newspaper across the country and that counts. Why? Because News Corp controls two thirds of all daily newspapers in Australia. In the group's national newspaper The Australian the lead story is headlined, ""Bad news on jobs, deficit and growth."" Below that is an 'exclusive,' titled ""Revealed: How Rudd blew $250bn."" Next to that is a red background teaser ""Budget Turmoil,"" pointing to several articles elsewhere in the newspaper. Stories such as, ""Let's face it: Treasury, Bowen have no clue,"" ""Another set of 'rushed proposals,"" ""Treasurer's assumptions are flaky,"" ""ALP to lift ceiling for its deficits,"" ""Cost of Rudd's PNG Solution will be a topic of hot debate,"" ""Tough disability rules to save Canberra $457m,"" ""Union snubs Labor campaign,"" ""Rivers of cash in pre-poll spend,"" ""Bowen using development funding as a 'honey pot',"" and ""Unemployment to hit GFC high."" The front page of the newspaper's 'Inquirer' supplement is headlined ""The $250bn cost of Kev,"" and goes on to outline the views of two economists who have determined ""The prime minister's time in office has been marked by waste and spending on an extraordinary scale."" The main story meantime doing the rounds on News Corp websites News.com.au, The Sun-Herald and The Courier-mail is titled, ""Tony Abbot says the Coalition is ready for the 2013 election."" So too is seems is Rupert Murdoch. (Footnote. In November 1975 all 109 journalists at The Australian went on strike in the middle of the federal election campaign arguing their newspaper was biased. Seventy five of the journalists signed a letter to Rupert Murdoch complaining of, ""…the deliberate and careless slanting of headlines, seemingly blatant imbalance in news presentation, political censorship and, more occasionally, distortion of copy from senior specialist journalists, the political management of news and features, the stifling of dissident and even palatably impartial opinion in the papers' columns…."").",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/563597150367378/?type=3,2013-08-03 03:20:16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_562559567137803,"Last month James Packer the Chairman of Crown Limited wrote to Chris Eccles the Director General of the NSW Premier's Department outlining the attributes he believed his company's proposal for a ""six star hotel casino"" at Barangaroo (in Sydney, Australia) would bring to New South Wales. In the letter Mr. Packer said Crown ""will make an upfront payment of up to $250 million to the NSW Government upon the issue of the VIP gaming license."" Within two weeks of receiving the Packer proposal, and a separate proposal from Echo Entertainment, the government had decided to accept Mr Packer's bid. But not quite. The license fee offered by Crown had been whittled down to $100 million. In the premier's press release on the day the decision was announced, Barry O'Farrell advised taxpayers the state would receive an upfront fee of $100 million. There was no mention of the fact that Crown had offered $250 million. So did Mr O'Farrell manage to beat Mr Packer down to a lower price? Not quite. The Packer bid included two proposals. One, an offer to pay $250 million with certain tax rates, and the other for $100 million with lesser tax rates. The tax proposed is worth noting. As we have reported previously the bulk of tax that will be paid by Crown Sydney will be tax on international and interstate VIP revenue which Crown proposed be 10% under the $100 million upfront license fee regime, and 9% under the $250 million scenario. For the lesser revenue-generating VIP local gaming the tax was proposed at 23% if the license fee was $250 million, or 27.5% if it was $100 million. The Assessment Panel recommended this be lifted to 29%, not the 27.5% Crown proposed. What the O'Farrell government has done is forfeit $150 million of the offered upfront fee to receive an extra 1% of the majority of tax to be raised, and an extra 6% tax of the lesser revenue. As we've pointed out before all tax rates for casinos in Australia include GST, so the effective tax rate for 10% would be less than 1% at 0.09%, in other words less than one tenth of 1%. The 29% after GST of 9.09% and a responsible gaming levy of 2%, will yield the government an effective tax rate of 17.91%. Regardless the Assessment Panel recommended to the government the $100 million option saying it did so, ""because it provides the opportunity for taxpayers to receive a greater share of the upside if Crown's proposal is successful, and because it maximises competitive neutrality if The Star's tax rates are maintained at current levels when renegotiated in FY2020."" Deloitte Access Economics was asked by the Premier Department's Assessment Panel to assess the two offers. No-one knows the brief they were given, but anyone with a calculator assessing present day values would have great difficulty in concluding the merit of knocking back $250 million in favour of $100 million, even if there was a case for what would have to be very skinny gains especially when they're based on forecasts that start six years into the future and are then extrapolated out many years again. Deloitte, the only independent expert it seems consulted by the Assessment Panel, did in fact have difficulty in doing that. Using four different scenarios, including Crown's forecasts and their own, Deloitte concluded whichever way it was looked at the $250 million offer for the Sydney license would provide a superior return to the NSW government. Their report said as much, putting the figure at $48 million. Despite this, Deloitte did say if the government wanted to take a risk it could ""capture a greater share of any upside,"" if it went for the $100 million option because of its higher tax rates. Their report actually makes reference to the potential for higher-than-anticipated growth in local VIP gaming, which both the casino's promoters and the government are trying to play down. The Deloitte report also makes a curious reference to international tax regimes saying there is potential for them to change beyond 2019 implying that this could be some sort of justification for accepting the lower upfront license fee. How the Assessment Panel relying on Deloitte's conclusions could determine the $100 million offer was better than the $250 million offer and in the best interests of NSW taxpayers is anyone's guess. One thing is certain, the people of New South Wales were not even told of the $250 million offer. The premier made no mention of it in his announcement at Parliament House earlier this month, in fact he said the $100 million was a condition of the government's approval. An upfront lump sum was always on the table and subject to legislation being enacted this year, which is extremely likely, it will be paid this year. Crown has promised that. So the O'Farrell government will knock back $250 million to be paid this year and instead accept $100 million so that in seven years time it can start to receive an extra one tenth of 1% of the majority of tax it collects, plus 6% of the lower local VIP revenue. The premier at the time of his announcement imposed four other conditions one of which was that Crown had to guarantee the state will receive a minimum $1 billion in license fee and gaming taxes in the first 15 years. What he didn't say is Crown had offered a guarantee of $1 billion in gaming taxes alone, nothing to do with the upfront fee. Again the government appears to have foregone another significant amount, $100 million in the form of a guarantee. This was not explained but should have been. To trumpet that Crown would be asked to pay 29% tax, instead of the 27.5% it proposed, but then not to say what had been conceded was not good. It was also not good to be only talking (in his announcement) of the local VIP tax when the essence of the Crown proposal is that its casino will primarily cater for overseas and interstate VIP gamers, paying significantly less, almost negligible, tax. The lack of transparency is disturbing. The premier has not indicated what the term of the license is to be. As he has been silent on that issue one can only assume the length of the license will be 99 years, the term proposed by Crown. Deloitte did a comparison of the two Crown license fee options and failed to provide any insight on whether what was being proposed was an appropriate value, particularly given the 99 year term of the license. It would appear the Assessment Panel, overseen by the Steering Committee, did little to satisfy itself of the value of the license which will allow Crown to particpate in the VIP market, which internationally alone according to Deloitte, using Crown's estimation, turned over $2.5 trillion last year of which Australia had a 2.5% share. No-one in terms of Deloitte, the Assessment Panel or the Steering Committee, or David Murray thought to obtain an independent valuation of the casino license they are all engaged in the process of recommending be awarded. In the United States casino licenses in states where there are multiple casinos are going for hundreds of millions of dollars, with some of those states charging up to 50% in tax. In 2004 Illinois put a licence up for tender and it brought $518 million (US dollars). Illinois has ten casinos, New South Wales has one. The tax rate for gaming in Illinois is 50%, and that is on all forms of gaming. Crown Melbourne's license, which was for 40 years (it expires in 2033) cost $300.8 million, and that was in 1993 (twenty years ago). If indeed the O'Farrell government has agreed to grant a 99 year VIP gaming license for the sum of $100 million that would be an extraordinary occurrence, particularly when it was offered $250 million. It should be pointed out one of the other 4 conditions the government has imposed is that license fee and tax be independently reviewed after 20 years. That may mean a review of the license fee then although the report is far from clear on that. Even if it was, there remains little sense in rejecting $250 million to be paid now, in place of $100 million plus minor and uncertain incremental tax from 2020 with a revision of the fee (if in fact it is to occur) in 2040. Deloitte, has tried valiantly to defend the case, probably at the behest of the Assessment Panel, which reviewed Deloitte's draft findings before they were finalised, but as Deloitte concluded the government would actually receive a net present value of $48 million greater by accepting the $250 million offer (and concluding it using four different scenarios), the people of New South Wales must be left wondering what is going on. The problem is they don't know what is going on. There is virtually no media or parliamentary scrutiny of the process. This has been a VIP members only sale with 60% off.

109808052412959_562549457138814,"US Army Private Bradley Manning has been found not guilty of aiding the enemy after leaking government secrets to WikiLeaks.

But the judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, found him guilty of espionage, theft and other charges on Tuesday, more than three years after he spilled secrets to WikiLeaks.

The judge deliberated for about 16 hours over three days before reaching her decision in a case that drew worldwide attention as supporters hailed Manning as a whistleblower.

The US government called him an anarchist computer hacker and attention-seeking traitor.

The intelligence officer who leaked 700,000 classified documents, has been held guilty of five counts of espionage and five theft charges, computer fraud and other military infractions, which could see him sentenced to prison for 136 years.

The 25-year-old Crescent, Okla., native acknowledged giving the anti-secrecy website hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports, diplomatic cables and videos in early 2010.

In his closing statement last week, lead military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said, ""Manning had the general evil intenthe acted voluntarily and deliberately with his disclosures.""

When Manning entered his guilty pleas earlier this year he spent an hour reading a statement to the court detailing why he leaked the documents. He explained that he had only released information that ""upset"" him, and not any that he believed could harm the United States:

""I believed if the public was aware of the data, it would start a public debate of the wars,"" he said.

Manning's defense team have argued that the intelligence analyst was nave and guilty of negligence but not the ""general evil intent"" that justifies a conviction for ""aiding the enemy"". To uphold this most serious charge, the judge must be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that Manning knew the leaked information could end up in the hands of Al-Qaeda.

Manning has, like Edward Snowden, had a large amount of support around the world from people who see him as a hero who stood up to the government.

American blogger Xeni Jardin tweeted that Manning flashed a ""faint smile"" as he was cleared of the most serious accusation - that he knowingly helped enemies of the US, most notably Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.

Protestors held balloons placards calling for the release for Pfc. Bradley Manning

Manning's lawyer David Coombs said outside court: ""We won the battle, now we need to go win the war. Today is a good day, but Bradley is by no means out of the fire.""

WikiLeaks described Manning's espionage convictions as ""dangerous national security extremism from the Obama administration"" on Twitter.

Manning's family said they were ""disappointed in today's verdicts but happy that the judge agreed that Bradley never intended to help America's enemies"", tweeted a Guardian journalist.

109808052412959_561168820610211,"Despite recent claims to the contrary,  Sydney is flush with new hotels, with many more in the pipeline. It has been extensively reported that only one 5 star hotel has been built in Sydney since 2000. This claim rightly or wrong conveys the impression there has been little in the way of new hotels built in the city in the past 13 years. Nothing could be further from the truth. What should also be understood is that several thousand new rooms were added to the city's hotel inventory in 1999 and 2000 in advance of the Sydney Olympic Games. Since 2000, thousands more rooms, suites and apartments have been added to Sydney's hotel stocks. Five star hotels to open since 2000 include Meriton's World Tower in 2003, Fraser Suites Sydney which opened in 2006, the Diamant Hotel at Kings Cross which opened in 2007, the Pullman at Sydney Olympic Park which opened in 2008, The Star at Darling Harbour and the QT Hotel in George street, both of which opened last year, and the 1888 Hotel at Pyrmont which opened earlier this year. In addition the 5 star Sydney Hilton Hotel was totally gutted and redeveloped in a $200 million revamp. It re-opened in 2005 after being closed for two-and-a-half years. Four and 4.5 star properties have been equally as popular. Last year the 4.5 star Quest Sydney Olympic Park opened its doors. The 4.5 star Courtyard by Marriott Macquarie Park North Ryde opened in September 2005. A budget Formula One hotel accompanied the opening of the Pullman at Sydney Olympic Park while Accor also built a three star Ibis Hotel near King Street Wharf. The 4.5 star Adina Crown opened in 2010. Harry Triguboff's Meriton established its serviced apartments wing in 2003, opening its flagship 5 star World Tower property that year, followed by 4 and 4.5 star serviced apartment hotels in Kent Street (431 apartments), the recently-opened Campbell Street (247 apartments), Bondi Junction (182 apartments), Waterloo (184 apartments), Zetland (334 apartments), and Parramatta (202 apartments). Quest too has been busy in the city and suburbs adding 4.5 star hotels at World Square, Potts Point, Campbelltown, Camperdown, Mascot, Castle Hill, North Ryde, and 4 star venues at Bondi Junction, Quest on Dixon Darling Harbour, and Rosehill Racecourse. And in April this year the 318 room 4.5 star Rydges Airport Hotel opened at the international airport terminal, while the 4.5 star Zara Tower hotel in the city opened earlier this month. In the pipeline, putting aside hotels yet to be announced, there's the new St Giles hotel being built in Hunter Street in the city, the new 5 star Baillies Hotel at The Rocks to be completed next year, InterContinental's first Holiday Inn Express in Australia at Macquarie Park in North Ryde, the 5 star Pacific QT at Bondi Beach, the 5 star InterContinental at Double Bay (the former Ritz-Carlton), the 4.5 star Adina Apartment Hotel Royal Randwick to be completed in 2015, the 4.5 star Adina apartment hotel at Bondi Beach to be completed this year, the 4.5 star Adina Apartment Hotel at Mascot less than a kilometre from Sydney Airport to be completed late next year, and the 4.5 star Adina Apartment Hotel Norwest. Lend Lease, as part of the Darling Harbour Live consortium (previously known as the Destination Sydney consortium) is building a hotel complex of up to 900 rooms (expected to be 4 and 5 star) adjoining the new Sydney Harbour Convention Centre at Darling Harbour, for which it was named the successful tenderer in November last year. That entire complex including the new hotel complex is slated to be open by late 2016. Echo is expected to build an additional 508 room five star hotel at The Star Casino, while the Crown Sydney 5 star hotel at Barangaroo, to be completed in 2018, will add another 350 rooms. In addition Sydney's largest hotel the Four Points by Sheraton at Darling Harbour will extend its 4.5 star room inventory from 672 to 906 rooms, with completion expected in mid-2015.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/561168820610211/?type=3,2013-07-28 13:44:31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""WikiLeaks was merely the platform that Pfc (Private First Class) Manning used to make sure all the information was available to the world, including the enemies of the United States,"" Army Major Ashden Fein said in his closing argument of Manning's trial here. ""Manning deliberately disclosed compromised information to the world."" The prosecutor said he was deployed to Iraq where he doubled up his extensive computer skills and used them for delving into and disclosing a treasure trove of US secrets that he knew would assist terrorist organizations in their efforts to attack the United States. Fein recounted with sharp details the heart of the government's case that Manning personally sought out WikiLeaks as his vehicle for exposing more than 700,000 combat videos, terrorism detainee assessments, State Department cables and other highly secret materials. ""He was not a naive soldier,"" Fein said. Manning, 25, has already pleaded guilty to 10 of the more than 20 counts he faces, and could face life in prison. Fein dismissed the defence's portrayal of Manning as a confused and disillusioned young man, saying that the leak was an abuse of trust while he worked as an intelligence analyst for the Army in Iraq.
""The flag meant nothing to him,"" Fein said. The prosecutor told the judge, Colonel Denise Lind, that Manning spent untold hours transmitting documents to WikiLeaks and hours more chatting online with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and following his orders, and even more time ""wiping"" his computer clean thinking he could ""hide his tracks"". ""The only human Manning ever cared about was himself,"" Fein said. ""He was interested in making a name for himself."" Manning trial, which began in June, is now nearing an end after it began in June. Judge Lind will decide whether Manning was a whistleblower who bravely sought to enlighten the world about government misconduct, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, or a traitor whose raw betrayal of the United States merits a sentence of life in prison with no parole. The prosecution stressed that the man from a small Oklahoma town committed espionage, endangered this country's national security and aided organizations such as Al Qaeda that continue to plot terrorist strikes against the US. Manning was arrested in May 2010 while serving in Iraq. He spent weeks in a cell at Camp

109808052412959_559316960795397,"(Big News Network) SYDNEY - New South Wales taxpayers have been told taxation levels from the proposed new Crown Sydney casino complex will deliver tax returns of 29%.

This level of taxation is greater than that proposed by Crown, NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell said in a statement on July 4.

The reality is the majority of tax paid by Crown will be 10% and as that is subject to GST of 9.09%, NSW taxpayers will get less than 1% on tax of the majority of gambling at Crown Sydney.

In announcing earlier this month the progression of Crown's unsolicited proposal to Stage 3, the NSW premier said the government was doing so on the basis of a number of conditions. One was that non-rebate gaming would be taxed at 29% (including GST and the Responsible Gaming Levy) ""and not 27.5% as proposed by Crown.""

By selectively commentating on one aspect of the proposed tax arrangements, the premier put in play what was inevitably reported in that the tax on gaming at the Sydney casino would be at 29%, which he said was more than what Crown had wanted.

The fact is that the 29% flat rate will only apply to non-rebate gaming revenue.

Given that the bulk of gambling at the proposed VIP gaming facility will be by international gamblers, what he should have said was what the rebate tax would be and that is 10%. Not only does this apply to international gamblers but it also applies to interstate gamblers too.

Further, the 29% rate on non-rebate gaming includes GST and the Responsible Gaming Levy which is 9.09% and 2% respectively, which means the NSW taxpayer will get 17.91%.

The 10% tax too is inclusive of GST but no calculation on that was included in the Assessment Report, prepared by the Premier Department's Assessment Panel or in the Steering Committee's report.

As the Australian Treasury says, ""GST is payable at a rate of one eleventh on the player loss of a gambling business, across all forms of gambling (ATO 2009a),"" it is clear the 10% on rebate gaming at Crown Sydney will be subject to GST of 9.09%, leaving NSW with a tax take of less than 1% (0.09%).

Crown of course, in both cases, with have all GST reimbursed by the Federal government. One could argue NSW will receive 31% of that 9.09% (2.8179%) back in the GST reallocation, however the Assessment Panel report says, ""It is noted that the NSW Government will provide Crown with a rebate of GST paid on international and interstate VIP gaming revenue, in line with practices for The Star."" What this exactly means in unclear. The complete lack of clarity on the proposed tax arrangements, given that they are the basis for the government's justification for granting a second casino license, is disturbing.

The reports does say the tax on non-rebate revenue in Sydney currently (at Echo) is 27.5% up to a certain threshold, after which it rises progressively (in $5 million increments) to a maximum of 50%. The NSW government proposes to apply the same 29% flat rate (actually 17.91% net) to Echo when Crown opens. ""The Star (Echo) will be transitioned to the same flat rate when its exclusivity period ends,"" the Steering Committee's report says. Whether they are able to do that or not is not clear. Echo is currently paying an average 28% and with the introduction of Crown, its tax could be lower under its existing formula. It is unknown whether Echo's license agreement provides for changing tax scales. Crown conversely has insisted there be no change in tax charges for the term of its license and that if there are any proposed fees, or additional taxes proposed then they only be so by agreement with Crown, and if they are implemented within the first 30 years of the license, Crown must be compensated. Where the Government stands on that is unclear. A condition recommended by the Steering Committee is that tax levels (for Crown Sydney) be reviewed after the first 20 years of operation.

What is also concerning are the representations, and lackoof representations, made in relation to tax in other jurisdictions which would be of importance in establishing that the proposed rates of taxation are fair and reasonable, and comparative with other markets such as Singapore.

This is particularly relevant as the NSW Government says it is basing its decision on the recommendations of the Assessment Panel which has considered matters such as these and has outlined them out in its report, which was a recommendation to Cabinet.

The only problem is the Assessment Report, which only refers to two other international markets, says by comparison to what is being proposed in Sydney, Singapore has a flat tax rate of 5%, and Macau 35%. These two destinations, Singapore with two casinos, and Macau with 33 casinos, are referred to repeatedly in the Crown application as a mirror of what can be achieved in terms of the benefits that could be achieved for international tourism in Australia. To be advising government the all gaming tax in Singapore is at a flat rate of 5% is just untrue. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore confirms premium players are taxed at 5% but PLUS GST of 7% making a total of 12% (remember the proposed Crown rates are also inclusive of GST), and for other players the rate is 15% PLUS GST of 7% making it 22%. So rather than Singapore charging a flat rate of 5%, Singapore in fact charges 12% for premium players, and 22% for all other players.

This incorrect information demonstrates a serious lack of rigor in the process of assessment of the Crown proposal. One would have thought the Assessment Panel, a wing of the Premier's Department, overseen by a more senior wing of the Premier's Department, would have at least requested information directly from Singapore's IRAS, and for that matter had serious discussions with government and casino regulators in other jurisdictions and reported that information, rather than simply stating things which appear to be untrue.

Such is the nature of the extent of thoroughness by the Steering Committee and the like-structured Assessment Panel that an internal memo from a member of the Stage 1 Assessment Panel to another member of the department dated 26 October 2012, a day after Barry O'Farrell announced the Government was advancing the Crown proposal to the second stage, called for a search on the Internet to obtain information on tax rates in other jurisdictions, and that was for Australian-based casinos where inter-government information requests would have been more readily responded to.

""Would you mind doing a search of Australian casino websites to see what we can discover re tax regimes, license fees and lump sum payments for licenses,"" the internal memo began. ""I understand different jurisdictions have different disclosures. For the moment we'll keep it to a desk top/web site search. If we have to approach jurisdictions we'll do that at some future point.""

""Of particular interest,"" the memo continued, ""are Burswood in Perth and Crown in Melbourne (both Crown facilities) but could you also see what we can find for Cairns, Townsville, Brisbane, and Hobart and we should have Star Casino in the mix.""

""If it could be tabulated that would be terrific,"" the memo concluded.

This is all fine for some internal backgrounding but for appraising comparative tax regimes in other jurisdictions to form the basis of an aspect of an assessment for recommending the establishment of a second casino license it falls well short.

The tax rates, the focus on the larger rate whereas the growth potential for the new casino will largely be in lower-taxed rebate gaming is a serious concern. The extent of cannibalisation, which Crown says will be minimal, could in fact erode the government's tax yield if Crown is wrong. To maintain competition the government's plan to tax both casinos at the same rate could lower the tax take from Echo, if cannibalisation does not occur. The most serious question, given the potential growth in VIP gaming is whether the 10% (0.09% net) flat rate is an appropriate tax.

These are issues needing far more consideration than what appears to have occurred, particularly as they involve forecasts starting from 2020 and going several decades into the future.

As it turned out, in the Assessment Panel report Cabinet members were provided virtually no information on comparative tax regimes anywhere in the world (other than wrong information for Singapore, and minimal information about Macau) but for a vague reference to Victorian gaming taxes relevant to Crown Melbourne which said, ""Victoria has higher tax rates on rebate based play, and lower rates on non-rebate based play.""

In what should have been an important focus of the Assessment Panel report, Cabinet ministers were provided with 5 sentences about tax levels in other jurisdictions, with no actual tax formulas for any casino in Australia (the Echo formula was detailed elsewhere in the report).

There are in fact many issues that appear not to have been addressed in this slap-dash analysis. Existing legislation, and Echo's constitution by law, prohibits any individual or company from holding more than 10% of voting stock in Echo. This was a condition of the granting of the license which followed a far more stringent, and far lengthier process than the current process. As James Packer's family holds 48% of Crown, how will legislators address that? Will Echo now have that condition relaxed to suit Crown, or will James Packer have to divert a large part of his family's holdings? Or will one casino have the ownership restriction, and the other not?

Too many issues and too little time taken to properly and diligently address them. (Big News Network).",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/559316960795397/?type=3,2013-07-24 07:53:29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_558628237530936,"A year ago this week, the usually tranquil coastal town of Burgas, Bulgaria, was shaken when a bomb exploded on a tourist bus, killing five Israeli vacationers and their Bulgarian bus driver. Within hours of the bombing, Israel claimed Hezbollah was responsible for the attack, and began to petition the European Union with renewed vigor to blacklist the group as a terrorist organisation. Bulgaria's government, backed by the UK, soon reiterated Israel's claims, with the interior minister at the time saying the two suspects responsible for the bombing ""were members of the military wing of Hezbollah."" Yet inconsistencies plagued the investigation, according to critics, and this year has seen a chain of contradictory statements emerging from Bulgaria over whether or not Hezbollah was actually behind the bombing, with the new government at one point distancing itself from the comments made by its predecessor, before returning back to accusing Hezbollah. Bulgaria has yet to complete its investigation into the attack, according to the interior minister. Regardless, it was this, along with a conviction by a Cypriot court against a Lebanese who is said to have confessed to being a courier for Hezbollah, that were listed as the reasons behind the EU decision on Monday to place the group's military wing on its terrorist list. Cyprus, for its part, was reportedly one of the countries opposed to listing Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist organisation. The decision ""shows that no organisation can carry out terrorist acts on European soil, such as the appalling attack in Bulgaria one year ago, without facing the consequences,"" William Hague, Britain's Foreign Minister, said following the announcement. Some experts, however, say the move by the EU is politically motivated and directly linked to Hezbollah's role in Syria's civil war. The fallout from Syria ""This is 100 percent related to Hezbollah's role in Syria, the fall of Qusayr, and the defeat of the Syrian rebels,"" Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, a political analyst and expert on Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera, referring to the Syrian regime's victory in June in the battle for the strategic town of Qusayr, in which Hezbollah confirmed it played an active role alongside the Syrian army. Jamal Ghosn, editor of Al Akhbar English, talks about the decision by the EU to blacklist Hezbollah. ""The West understands the Syrian regime is not going to fall, and so this has pushed the EU to come out with this decision,"" she said. ""This is a PR war where they're trying to brand Hezbollah as terrorists, and equate them to groups like al-Qaeda."" Yezid Sayigh, a senior associate at Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut told Al Jazeera that such a move was more figurative than anything that would have actual impact on the ground, both in Lebanon and in Europe. ""This is more of a symbolic move in its impact, as the EU hasn't placed the political wing on the terrorist list,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""Impacts at this stage will be quite limited partly because the contacts between Hezbollah and the EU are limited, and Hezbollah has limited presence and activity in the EU countries."" For Sayigh, Hezbollah's role in Syria ""hardened"" EU positions; some countries which would not have otherwise backed such a decision felt forced to do so. Hezbollah has publicly confirmed playing a military role in Syria alongside the Syrian army, which it claims is limited to border areas where Lebanese are residing, as well as providing security for the Shia religious shrine, Sayda Zaynab, in Damascus. Syria's opposition disputes these claims, accusing the group of playing a more significant role in the ongoing conflict. In Lebanon, the Saudi and US backed March 14 movement, has long held Hezbollah responsible for any security breach in the country, blaming its role in Syria as a direct cause of instability in Lebanon. In May, the Future movement, a faction within the March 14 coalition, accused Hezbollah of having ""transformed itself from a resistance to a militia working under Iranian orders"". Terrorists or a resistance movement? Hezbollah is no stranger to accusations of terrorism, more so since its involvement in Syria. Formed in the early 1980s in the middle of Lebanon's civil war, the movement was created as a resistance to the Israeli occupation  in Lebanon. Hezbollah (Party of God), a Shia political and military organisation backed by Iran, is deemed to be one of the stronger political factions inside the country, and has a presence within Lebanon's current caretaker government. It has an extensive social welfare programme across the south of Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut's southern suburbs, and it is internationally known for its military operations.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/558628237530936/?type=3,2013-07-23 07:53:40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_558297260897367,"SYDNEY - In the face of unprecedented media support and unprecedented access to the office of the NSW state premier, James Packer's Crown Limited has had a whirlwind success in all but attaining a second casino license in Sydney without tender, without scrutiny, and without any real regard for the interests of the people of the state.

The first question NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell failed to ask, failed to address, failed to elicit expert advice on, failed to ask the people of New South Wales by referendum, or even by seeking public submissions, was whether Sydney in fact needed, or for that matter wanted, a second casino.

The premier did not raise the issue in parliament, rather James Packer and lobbyists, former ALP General Secretary, Karl Bitar, and former NSW State Secretary Mark Arbib, neither of whom appear to be on the NSW lobbyists register, went to the premier, members of the Government, the opposition parties and independents and tied up their support direct.

Fast track through the past seventeen months and we have on July 4 Barry O'Farrell announcing that the Crown proposal would proceed to Stage 3 of the unsolicited proposals process. O'Farrell repeatedly referred to the ""independent Steering Committee."" The Crown announcement to the ASX the same day did the same. Go back some months and it was the ""Steering Committee,"" which would have an 'independent' chairman, David Murray.

Unfortunately there are very few people asking questions. No one in the media has highlighted who is on this Steering Committee that has been instrumental in recommending to the state a casino license be awarded. And no one from the opposition parties has questioned it. If they had the public would have know every aspect of the investigation of the Crown proposal has been an inside job from the start. Take a look at the Steering Committee. It is headed by Barry O'Farrell's right hand man Chris Eccles who is the Director General of the Premier's Department. 

Also on the 3 man committee is the Secretary of the Treasury Phil Gaetjens, and Mark Paterson, the head of the Department of Trade and Investment, Regional infrastructure and Services. No independent persons, no independent experts.

Secondly there is the 'negotiating team,' which doubles sometimes as the 'Assessment Panel.' This is the body of people that actually does the negotiations with Crown and provides the 'rigorous scrutiny.' Who are they? They are virtually one and the same as the Steering Committee, but not quite. They comprise the deputies of the three people on the Steering Committee. Simon Smith is the chairman of the negotiating team. He is one of four deputy director generals in the Premier's Department. Tim Spencer, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, and Mark Duffy, Paterson's nominee are on the team. So when it comes to being independent, there is nothing independent even between the Steering Committee and the Assessment Panel (negotiating team), and certainly far from being independent of the Premier's Department.

Despite the composition of the state's investigating bodies, which were put together by the Premier's Department, the premier on July 4 when announcing Crown Limited's proposal opened his official press release with the statement: ""NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell today announced the NSW Government has conditionally accepted the recommendation of the independent Steering Committee to progress to Stage 3 Crown Limited's unsolicited proposal to develop a VIP gaming facility at Barangaroo."" 

The Premier's Department press release also said, ""An independent Steering Committee, chaired by former Chairman of the Future Fund David Murray AO was appointed to assess both proposals (Echo's and Crown's), with the assistance of Deloitte Access Economics to ensure rigorous and comprehensive appraisal of each.""

The statement makes reference to an' independent Steering Committee' five times. It also refers to the report as ""Mr Murray's assessment."" It makes no mention of the 'negotiating team' which conducted the appraisal and did all of the negotiations. Many commentators in the media have invariably referred to the report as David Murray's report and his assessment, or his decision. It would appear however he had little to do with the process other than serve as a public face for the Steering Committee which left all the 'negotiations' to their offsiders. The process was run entirely by the Premier's Department.

The Assessment Panel (negotiating team) met with Crown representatives 20 times, and Echo representatives twenty times. None of those meetings were attended by David Murray. He attended just two separate meetings with Crown representatives ""to receive a briefing on the preliminary final proposal and identify key issues for the assessment.""

David Murray was hired on a daily rate. Requirements for his involvement were foreshadowed as being a half-day, once a fortnight, to prepare for and chair meetings. ""These meetings will devise and agree on strategy and necessary supporting work, oversight and guide negotiations, provide progress reporting and recommendations for the Government, and sign off on reports for public release as required by the Government,"" Simon Smith, Eccles deputy wrote in a briefing note on the appointment of the independent chairman. ""The person would also need to present a public face for the process, when required to do so by the Government,"" he said. ""The independent person would not be conducting the negotiations. His role is to oversight the process.""

We come to the Deloitte report produced for Stage 1 of the Crown process which has attracted some comment, firstly because Deloitte is the auditor for Crown's Macau casino, and secondly because Barry O'Farrell refused to release it to the public, arguing it was a report prepared for Cabinet. He has since relented saying it would be released following Cabinet's decision.

What is unclear is what the Stage 2 process entailed or whether the government received any expert assistance in its negotiations with Crown, other than relying on a second report from Deloitte. This despite the fact that funds had been made available for this purpose. ""DPC has reserved resources in its budget to engage top line negotiating, commercial, legal and financial advisory services as required. These would be drawn from Treasury's panel of pre-qualified advisory firms,"" Smith wrote in a briefing note about the Crown proposal.

Back to Stage 1 and the first Deloitte's report. Deloitte was asked to do a peer review of the Crown submission which included an assessment by The Allen Consulting Group, which was commissioned by Crown Limited. Such is the breathtaking speed of this process is that Deloitte was contacted on the day the Crown proposal was lodged, September 6 2012. By September 17 Deloitte had been engaged and the Premier's Department had a draft copy of their report by September 21. Unless there is some undisclosed process that has occurred, the Deloitte report appears to have provided the only independent scrutiny of the Packer proposal at that point. The Deloitte report, charged on an hourly rate, cost around $20,000. This seems a little light, given the resources available to the State, that so little was done in terms of independently examining the claims of Crown and its consultants. This however was the expectation of the Assessment Panel as the Deloitte report's introduction reads, ""Deloitte Access Economics has been asked to prepare a short report reviewing the unsolicited proposal put forward by Crown."" As such Deloitte only had half-a-dozen questions relating to the Allen report and none about Crown's lengthy claims. The Assessment Panel, making the crucial first decision to advance the process to Stage 2 met only twice before making their decision. Their report says, ""On 14 September 2012 the Premier's Department requested clarification and elaboration of some information provided by the proponent. This clarification was provided on September 18 2012.""

So the Premier's Department establishes an Assessment Panel, the first one for Stage 1 comprising the deputy of the Premier's Department Simon Smith, Di Leeson of the Premier's Department and Tim Murphy of Treasury. They requested clarification on some information from Crown. They ask Deloitte to prepare a short report. Deloitte asks 6 questions of Crown's consultants. Deloitte are engaged on 17 September and attend the first meeting of the Assessment Panel on September 19 to discuss their findings, and deliver their report on September 21. Then on October 15 the Assessment Panel report to Cabinet, endorsed by the Steering Committee, recommends Crown's application to Stage 2, provided Cabinet is of the view the government, ""would be willing to consider the policy and legislative amendments that would be required to permit a second casino to operate in NSW.""

The purpose of the unsolicited proposals process is for the government and the private sector to engage in a transparent and streamlined approach to introduce innovative ideas. It is for projects that are legal. At this time in New South Wales casinos are illegal, but for the one casino license held by Echo. To process an application to legalise a second casino under the unsolicited proposals mechanism is entirely inappropriate. Having unilaterally decided that it was, the Premier's Department recommended to Cabinet it consider granting a casino license a little more than a month after Crown lodged its application after the recommending body having just two meetings and commissioning a $20,000 report on the financial aspects of the proposal and their benefit to the state. 

The people of New South Wales deserve better.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/558297260897367/?type=3,2013-07-22 17:37:16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Manning, 25, has denied the charges saying he did not intend to benefit terrorist groups with the information that he gave Wikileaks but rather his intention was to spark a conversation about America's actions abroad. The judge's refusal to throw out the charge has, according to his lawyers, left a dangerous precedent for individuals who leak information to journalists and that it could affect more traditional news organizations. The government has argued that his actions, that led Wikileaks to publish the leaked information, in turn helped terror groups such as al-Qaeda. Manning's legal team counter-argues that he only shared the information to change US foreign policy. They said that the government had also failed to prove that the private had ""actual knowledge"" that he was providing intelligence to al-Qaeda. The trial at a military base in Maryland is drawing to a close. ""He was knowingly providing intelligence to the enemy,"" said Judge Colonel Denise Lind after prosecutors argued he ""systematically harvested"" documents eventually seen by Osama Bin Laden. The judge also asked the government's lawyer if the type of journalistic enterprise mattered when considering the damage to US interests.

109808052412959_555381724522254,"India's reputation as a country is becoming increasingly battered by what appears to be an endless stream of shocking attacks on women and children.

The incidence of reported rape cases in India, where there is impunity for rape committed by husbands and members of security forces, is not higher than other countries, but authorities fear the number of unreported cases is distorting the national figures.

On Tuesday alone this week came news of an eight-year-old boy being sodomised by a man in his house in New Delhi, a 3-year-old girl was raped by a twenty-year-old unemployed youth in Bhopal, while in Gurgaon district of Haryana a 50-year old was charged with raping his mother.

Last Sunday eight men abducted 4 girls aged between 12 and 14 from a convent boarding house in the country's east and raped them in a nearby forest.

A 10-year-old girl died in Mumbai last month after being repeatedly raped by four suspects. 

In New Delhi on Wednesday a high official in India's agriculture department was arrested after a complaint from his five daughters alleging that he had repeatedly raped each of them. The women, who have since married, went to police after they found the man had starting raping his granddaughters. The man's wife has also been charged for refusing to report the crimes after being told of her daughters' ordeals. She told her daughters to ignore the raping as it was ""a family tradition.""

Despite a number of high profile attacks in recent months that have attracted international coverage, the number of reported cases continues to rise. A rape is reported every 20 minutes. Many people across India have joined in protests. One reason for the increasing number of attacks is the judiciary, and their refusal to take a tough stand. The man who sodomised the 8-year-old boy for example was sentenced to just 3 years in prison this week, and was ordered to pay Rs 10,000 Indian Rupees), the equivalent to just $161 in compensation to the victim.

In December, the gang rape and death of a twenty three-year old woman in Delhi triggered demands for criminal law reform in India. The Government set up a three-member committee headed by former Supreme Court Chief Justice JS Verma to review laws against sexual assault. However, in February, the President signed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013, which ignored many of the key recommendations of the Verma Committee.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/555381724522254/?type=3,2013-07-19 06:57:58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 On the face of it, Edward Snowden broke US law when he revealed details of its international eavesdropping programme. 

 However, the benefits of his actions to Americans and the international community, by most accounts, outweigh the cost even in terms of national security. The US should give up its efforts to capture and prosecute him; it should grant him a pardon.

 If Snowden and whistleblowers like him have committed a crime, it is one of conscience. His actions were not motivated by personal profit, but by the greater good; he attempted to end wrongdoing by US officials the indiscriminate invasion of privacy. In the past, the prosecution of whistleblowers did not stop others from revealing the abuse of power. Their desire for justice overcame their fear of punishment and this will more often than not continue to be the case.

 A pardon will not open the floodgates to further breaches as laws will continue to be enforced. Rather it will be a recognition that an accountable government accepts and helps its citizens to do the right thing.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/546209732106120/?type=3,2013-06-30 07:40:14,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_545786472148446,"The distance between Cairo's Tahrir Square and Istanbul's Taksim Square is impossibly long.

There can be no roadmap sufficient enough to use the popular experience of the first in order to explicate the circumstances that lead to the other.

Many have tried to insist on the similarities between the two since it is fashionable these days to link news worthy events however worlds apart, to other events. Following the popular revolt that gripped Egypt in early 2011, deemed with the ever inclusive title 'the Arab Spring', intellectual jugglers began envisaging 'springs' popping up all over the region and beyond. In recent weeks, when protesters took to the streets of several Turkish cities, comparisons ensued once again.

Intellectual opportunism however is not a distinct phenomenon, but a reflection of a wider western conception of political opportunism. Once the 'Arab Spring' was recognized as an opportunity of sorts, the US, Britain and France were quick to capitalize on it, either to politically reshape the Middle East region or to ensure that the outcome of the revolutionary fervor was to their liking.

While Arab dictators brutalized mostly peaceful protesters, wars, in the full sense of the word, didn't actualize until the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries began meddling. In Libya, they guided an uprising with a limited armed component to a full-fledged war that resulted in the death, wounding and disappearance of thousands. The war in Libya changed the very demographic landscape of parts of the country. Entire communities have been ethnically cleansed. Benghazi, whose fate British Prime Minister David Cameron seemed particularly worried about, is now savaged by numerous militias vying for influence. Following recent clashes in the city, the interim head of the Libyan army, Salem Konidi, warned on state Television on June 15, of a 'bloodbath'. But this time, such a warning barely registered on NATO's radar.

While selective 'humanitarian interventions' is a well-known western political style, the recent protests in Turkey demonstrate that western countries' appetite to exploit any country's misfortunes to its advantage is insatiable. The Turkish government however has itself to blame for providing such an opportunity in the first place.

When confronted with the Middle East high-stakes political game resulting from the violent upheaval in the last two years or so, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, hesitant at first, adopted a political style that was consistent with NATO's, of which Turkey is a member. For nearly a decade, Turkey had angled for a different role in the Arab and Muslim worlds, a choice that was compelled by the European Union's refusal to grant Turkey a membership. Germany and France led the crusade against Turkey's determined efforts to join the growing union.

As the bloodletting reached Syria, the so-called Arab Spring posed a threat to Turkey's own southern regions and thus forced a hurried Turkish policy realignment, back to the very western camp that precluded Turkey for so long.

It was a peculiar position in which Turkey placed itself, posing as a champion of 'awakened' Arabs, yet operating with the traditional NATO paradigm, itself grounded in interventionist agendas. The inconsistencies of Turkish policies are too palpable and growing: as it settled its dispute with Israel over the latter's murder of nine Turkish activists on their way to Gaza in May 2010, it was hosting top Hamas leaders for high level talks. It is facilitating the work of Syrian opposition that are operating both politically and militarily from Turkish territories, while warning against any plots to destabilize Turkey. At the same time it is paying little heed to the sovereignty of northern Iraq, as it chased after its own armed opposition in the war-torn Arab country for years.

Turkish behavior was ignored, justified or sanctioned by western powers as long as Ankara did so in tandem with the existing NATO policies. European countries however become particularly charged if Turkey stepped over its boundaries, as was the case during the Turkish-Israeli dispute. And it appears that no matter how hard Turkish leaders try to impress, they will always fall short from fulfilling Europe's selective definition of democracy, human rights and other useful concepts.

NATO's hypocrisy even among its own members is too obvious. Compare for example European responses to the police crackdown on the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement protests starting September 17, 2011 and the massive campaign of arrests, beatings and humiliation of protesters. It turned out that both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security monitored the movement jointly through their terrorism task forces. This is what Naomi Wolf revealed in the Guardian newspaper on December 29 of last year.

Where was the outcry by the US European ally over such unwarranted practices including the most recent scandal of US National Security Agency (NSA) spying on millions of people using social media and internet technology in the name of trying to catch terrorists? Such practices have become so routine that they rarely compel outrage or serious calls for accountability, aside from such inane concerns as Bloomberg Business Week headlines: ""Spying for the NSA Is Bad for U.S. Business."" (June 18)

While Arab nations are the most affected parties by the wars and upheavals that have destabilized the region, destroyed Syria and threaten the future of entire generations, they seem to stand as cheerleaders on the sidelines as David Cameron, François Hollande of France and Barack Obama, among others, illustrate the path by which Syria's future is determined, in ways consistent with their interests, and of course, that of Israel's 'security'.

But the response of some EU leaders to the anti-government protests in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir in recent weeks was most sobering. Even Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's best efforts are simply not enough to sway Europe from capitalizing on Turkey's misfortunes. German Chancellor Angela Merkel quickly took a stance to block ""moves to open a new chapter in Ankara's EU membership talks"", reported Reuters on June 20, supposedly because of her concern regarding the Turkish police crackdown on protesters. Of course the Chancellor is often forgiving when extreme violence is applied by Israel against Palestinians, since no political capital can be attained from such unwise moves.

Meanwhile, western powers will continue to play a most detrimental role in the Middle East, engendering and exploiting further chaos with the help of various regional powers, in the most brazen of ways in order to serve their interests. Not even Turkey, despite proving an irreplaceable asset in NATO's political and military drive, is invulnerable. 

Perhaps, Europe's double face will compel a rethink among Turkey's political circles as they calculate their next move. Will Turkey end its role as an outlet for NATO's policies in the Middle East? This is a question that Turkey must address before they too are engulfed by endless turmoil and inundated by western intervention, as the results are always lethal.

109808052412959_542825585777868,"US whistleblower Edward Snowden's final destination may be Venezuela, Cuba or Ecuador. Snowden, who revealed US spying on countries like India, Pakistan, and China and eavesdropping on its own citizens' conversations, flew out of Hong Kong on Sunday to Moscow. The US intelligence fugitive arrived in Moscow Sunday evening, but Moscow is not intended to be his final destination. The 29-year-old intelligence analyst had leaked information about the US government's massive intelligence gathering programme. ""Mr Edward Snowden left Hong Kong today (June 23) on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel,"" the Hong Kong government said in a statement. The Russian foreign ministry said the former CIA agent Snowden might be travelling on a transit flight via Moscow. ""According to some reports, Snowden may be travelling via Moscow as a transit passenger,"" the ministry said, adding it was verifying the information. Meanwhile, police at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport said it had no plan to detain Snowden.
""We have not received any instructions concerning this person. However, in order to enter Russian territory he should have a valid visa,"" Interfax news agency quoted a policeman at the airport as saying. A complication for Moscow is that the U.S. has canceled Snowden's passport which may prevent them allowing him to board a plane. It is not known whether Snowden has a passport issued by another country. US authorities have charged the 29-year-old intelligence analyst with leaking information about the US government's massive programme, with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. He fled to Hong Kong in May after revealing details of extensive Internet and phone surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA). On Saturday, the White House contacted Hong Kong to try to arrange his extradition, but according to the Chinese territory's administration the documents submitted by Washington did not ""fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law"". Hong Kong requested further information from the US Justice Department.
""As the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has yet to have sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr Snowden from leaving Hong Kong,"" the statement said, adding Washington has been informed of Hong Kong's decision. ""He's going to be facing serious consequences no matter what happens,"" Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian journalist who helped break Snowden's story, told CNN's Reliable Sources on Sunday. ""He had a life in which he was living in the United States. He was an American citizen his whole life. He had a long-term girlfriend in Hawaii, a stable, lucrative career, all of which he gave up in order to bring to light what he believed is serious wrongdoing on the part of our highest political officials. And he's now, no matter what, at best - going to spend the rest of his life on the run from the most powerful government on earth.""
Snowden left the US after leaking details of the extensive US surveillance programme to Britain's Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post. According to The Guardian, a snapshot of the Boundless Informant data, contained in a top secret NSA ""global heat map"", shows that in March 2013 the agency collected 97 billion pieces of intelligence from computer networks worldwide.
While the largest amount of intelligence was gathered from Iran, with more than 14 billion reports in that period, it was followed by 13.5 billion from Pakistan. Jordan, one of America's closest Arab allies, came third with 12.7 billion, Egypt fourth with 7.6 billion and India fifth with 6.3 billion.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/542825585777868/?type=3,2013-06-23 18:15:08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On June 9th, Snowden, a US citizen living in Hong Kong admitted to his role in leaking sensitive classified information to the press.

US court documents allege Snowden stole government property and allowed unauthorized communication of national defence information and classified intelligence information to an unauthorized person.

The criminal complaint is dated back to June 14th. 

On June 6th, newspapers in the United States and Britain published information, purportedly received from Snowden, which revealed the existence of a top secret US court order that allowed for the collection of data on millions of Americans who are customers of major US phone company Verizon.

On the same day, the Washington Post reported that the NSA had direct access to all Internet servers in the United States.

Snowden has since alleged that Britain's spy agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, had also gained access to the network of cables that carry the world's phone calls and Internet traffic and had begun to process and share sensitive personal information with its American partner, the NSA. 

For Snowden to be tried in the United States, Washington will have to seek Snowden's extradition from Hong Kong.

In a vicious response to testimony from Ben Bernanke that quantum easing at some point must end, and that bond-buying by the Fed will be phased down, an almost-unprecedented selling frenzy emerged. Nothing was spared. Global stock markets were routed, bond prices plummeted as yields rose above 18 month highs. Commodity prices, precious and industrial dived, some by as much as 6% to 8%. Gold fell to a 2 1/2 year low below $1,300 an ounce while silver dropped more than 3%. Oil lost $3  barrel. And currencies, they were lower across the board. The Australian dollar lost three cents in just two hours.

At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones was down 353.87 points or 2.34% to 14,758.32. The benchmark index was down 380 points at one stage. 

The Nasdaq Composite lost 78.57 points or 2.28% to 3,364.64.

The Standard and Poor's 500 40.73 points or 2.50% to 1,588.19.

""Ben Bernanke has put the cat well and truly among the pigeons with his statement that asset purchases would begin slowing by the end of this year,"" Yusuf Heusen, sales trader at IG told The Guardian. ""It does feel as if the Fed chairman has pulled the rug from underneath the stock market rally, and he certainly seems to have dealt a killer blow to gold.""

Markets in Asia, Europe, and the Americas crumbled one after the other. London's FTSE 100 dropped by 189 points or nearly 3% to its biggest fall since September 2011. The German Dax lost 3.26% while the Paris-based CAC 40 was down 3.66%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 shaved 1.66% off its value, while the Australian All Ords was of 2.02%. The Shanghai Composite was down 2.77%. 

The U.S. dollar soared as commodity prices fell (most commodities including gold and oil are quoted in U.S. dollars).

109808052412959_537297786330648,"The U.S. Justice Department should hang their heads in shame over the deal they've done with former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling.

The full story on Big News Network:

Jeff Skilling will be back in court next week to be resentenced. The hearing will put an end to a 9 year saga of court cases, appeals and re-appeals, one the U.S. Department of Justice will be glad to see the end of.

And rightly so, the resources and money spent by Justice to convict Skilling and keep him behind bars has been extraordinary. The deal however they have struck with Skilling and his lawyers is ludicrous.

Skilling should not have ten years shaved off his 24 year sentence. He of course has to accept the deal. He has spent years and plenty of cash in trying to prove he was wrongfully convicted. as his lawyer says there comes atime, and he needs the ""certainty,"" and the ""finality.""

The twenty four years in the first place was a rediculous sentence. In the second place the conviction was not attained in the ordinary course of justice, it was a political statement. Skilling and Lay became the public scapegoats for the systematic fraud at Enron, neither of whom were the perpetrators or the beneficiaries.

What is very disturbing is that during Skilling's trial, prosecutors concealed evidence helpful to the defence.

In a subsequent appeals court filing Skilling's lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, alleged the government bolstered its case by hiding statements from Enron's former Chief Financial Officer Andy Fastow.

Under the law prosecutors are compelled to hand over any evidence they encounter in their investigations to the defence, notwithstanding it may not help their case.

Petrocelli alleged in the filing that more than 400 pages of notes taken by FBI agents during numerous interviews with Fastow indicated some of his initial statements to authorities were not as damning as those in his testimony during Skilling's 2006 trial.

Petrocelli, according to The Houston Chronicle, called the contents of the notes ""shocking,"" and said the government wrongly hoarded them in bad faith.

""Skilling's life has been destroyed. His ability to receive a fair trial has been irretrievably lost,"" Petrocelli wrote in the filing.

The FBI agents' notes are sealed from public view, but Petrocelli outlined some of their contents.

Specifically, he said the notes challenge or contradict Fastow's trial testimony asserting that he and Skilling had several secret agreements that a Fastow-run partnership wouldn't lose money if it bought problematic Enron assets so the energy company could book earnings.

""The task force was able to skew the proof and convince the jury to accept Fastow's word over Skilling's,"" the filing said.

Among others, as outlined in Kristen Hays Houston Chronicle article, Petrocelli listed the following inconsistencies between Fastow's testimony and his statements to investigators:

 Fastow testified Skilling knew about a so-called ""Global Galactic,"" or list of Fastow partnership deals with Enron in which the partnership was guaranteed not to lose money. The notes say Fastow ""doesn't think (he) discussed the list w/JS.""

 Fastow testified Skilling gave him a ""bear hug"" to signify that the partnership wouldn't lose money if it bought three power plants moored on barges from Merrill Lynch  Co., which had agreed to buy and hold them for six months. The notes say Fastow told investigators that he ""did not obligate"" Enron to buy the barges from Merrill, and the company agreed to try to find another buyer.

""There is no innocent explanation for the suppression of this evidence,"" Petrocelli said in the filing.

While he has been incarcerated, Skilling has had to sell his River Oaks mansion and ""virtually all of his personal possessions,"" the filing said. In addition, both of his parents died since he went to prison and his youngest son.

Skilling was saddled with almost all the blame for Enron's  collapse.

Prosecutors went after him and the company's founder and Chairman Kenneth Lay, doing deals with underlings, like Fastow, to secure convictions.

U.S. District Court Judge Sim Lake accepted the prosecution's case and jailed Skilling for a virtual lifetime, 24 years and four months. Skilling was then 52 years old.

Skilling was also ordered by the judge to forfeit $45 million of his $60 million net worth to a restitution fund for victims of the Enron collapse. Lake allocated the remaining $15.5 million to Skilling's lawyers in part-payment of legal fees owed. 

Internationally the trial was seen as a virtual witch-hunt as Skilling was far removed from the series of frauds and deception that brought the company to its knees in a $68 billion collapse.

Indisputably, the main villain in the Enron scandal was not its CEO or Chairman, it was the company's Chief Financial Officer Andy Fastow.

Fastow masterminded the entire process behind the company's downfall. He first set up vehicles that he himself controlled, and then did transactions with his employer, often buying or selling Enron's assets at hugely reduced, or inflated prices. He orchestrated every single transaction, set the prices, bribed underlings, and misled company officers, including Skilling and Lay.

Every single Fastow deal was signed off by company lawyers, Vinson  Elkins, and auditors, Arthur Andersen, before going to the board.

When an employee Sherron Watkins raised the alarm in a personal interview with Lay, Lay brought in the company's lawyers commissioning them to do a thorough investigation. 'Lay' she said, 'was a little incredulous that anything could be wrong. He pointed out that none of these transactions were hidden and that the board knew all about them.' The lawyers, Vinson  Elkins, reported back the transactions were all in order. During the trial in which Watkins testified against Lay and Skilling, she herself admitted to selling $47,000 worth of shares in Enron despite her inside knowledge. She was never charged for insider trading.

The injustice dealt Skilling was further underscored by the fact that he had left the company months before events started to unravel. Cutting across the prosecution's case was the fact that Skilling repeatedly offered to return to the company to help it out. 

Fastow meantime, after singularly masterminding the biggest fraud in history, one where he was the majority beneficiary of all the fraud and deception that took place, and after doing a deal with prosecutors, received a six year jail term. Despite his extensive criminal involvement, Fastow was the prosecutors' chief witness in the trial against Skilling and Lay, neither of whom pocketed a single cent from the Fastow deals.

The U.S. Justice Department made a good choice in Fastow. He is a proven liar, one of the best conmen in history. He managed to pull the wool over the eyes of some of the smartest bankers, fund managers, stock analysts, lawyers, and auditors in the United States, along with Skilling, and the entire Enron board, including Lay. For Fastow, the judge and jury were a piece of cake.

At Fastow's sentencing, U.S. District Judge Ken Hoyt said he had taken account of Fastow's cooperation with prosecutors, his desire to help victims suing to recover their losses, and his visible remorse. He did not order Fastow to give up any of his fraudulently obtained gains, noting he had already forfeited $24 million, a fraction of his ill-gotten fortune.

Fastow's wife, an accessory to the largest corporate crime in U.S. history, served 12 months, as part of her husband's deal.

Fastow is already out of jail, he was released on December 16 2011. Skilling, even with the resentencing will serve another eight years (He has already been in jail for 7 years). And Kenneth Lay? He collapsed and died of a heart attack shortly after his conviction, after strenuously maintaining his innocence. His conviction was wiped as he was denied the opportunity of appealing his conviction. (Soon after his death the government filed a civil suit against Lay's widow and children to seize the family home and other assets valued at about $12.7 million).

This is one case we have pursued since both Skilling and Lay were convicted. It is probably the greatest miscarriage of justice in American corporations law. 

Now, a long way away from the raw emotion of the tens of thousands of Enron employees losing their jobs and their savings, and the suddenness and drama of the multi-billion dollar collapse of one of America's most admired companies, the injustice to Skilling goes on. 

Never have we seen such a monstrous fraud committed against so many people, where the perpetrator has been given a light sentence, and given the chance to pass on the blame for his misdeeds to others, and a hapless CEO who was at the end of the line after company executives, lawyers, and auditors, and the board of directors, having to take the hit, is stripped of all his assets, and jailed for twenty four years.

109808052412959_536553946405032,"Julian Assange has called the Bradley Manning court-marital a ""show trial."" The hearing began last Monday at Fort Meade in Maryland. This is what Assange has to say in his own words: ""The court martial of the most prominent political prisoner in modern US history has now, finally, begun. It has been three years. Bradley Manning, then 22 years old, was arrested in Baghdad on May 26, 2010. He was shipped to Kuwait, placed into a cage, and kept in the sweltering heat of Camp Arifjan. ""For me, I stopped keeping track,"" he told the court last November. ""I didn't know whether night was day or day was night. And my world became very, very small. It became these cages... I remember thinking I'm going to die."" After protests from his lawyers, Bradley Manning was then transferred to a brig at a US Marine Corps Base in Quantico, VA, where - infamously - he was subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at the hands of his captors - a formal finding by the UN. Isolated in a tiny cell for twenty-three out of twenty-four hours a day, he was deprived of his glasses, sleep, blankets and clothes, and prevented from exercising. All of this - it has been determined by a military judge - ""punished"" him before he had even stood trial. ""Brad's treatment at Quantico will forever be etched, I believe, in our nation's history, as a disgraceful moment in time"" said his lawyer, David Coombs. ""Not only was it stupid and counterproductive, it was criminal."" The United States was, in theory, a nation of laws. But it is no longer a nation of laws for Bradley Manning. When the abuse of Bradley Manning became a scandal reaching all the way to the President of the United States and Hillary Clinton's spokesman resigned to register his dissent over Manning's treatment, an attempt was made to make the problem less visible. Bradley Manning was transferred to the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He has waited in prison for three years for a trial - 986 days longer than the legal maximum - because for three years the prosecution has dragged its feet and obstructed the court, denied the defense access to evidence and abused official secrecy. This is simply illegal - all defendants are constitutionally entitled to a speedy trial - but the transgression has been acknowledged and then overlooked. Against all of this, it would be tempting to look on the eventual commencement of his trial as a mercy. But that is hard to do. We no longer need to comprehend the ""Kafkaesque"" through the lens of fiction or allegory. It has left the pages and lives among us, stalking our best and brightest. It is fair to call what is happening to Bradley Manning a ""show trial"". Those invested in what is called the ""US military justice system"" feel obliged to defend what is going on, but the rest of us are free to describe this travesty for what it is. No serious commentator has any confidence in a benign outcome. The pretrial hearings have comprehensively eliminated any meaningful uncertainty, inflicting pre-emptive bans on every defense argument that had any chance of success. Bradley Manning may not give evidence as to his stated intent (exposing war crimes and their context), nor may he present any witness or document that shows that no harm resulted from his actions. Imagine you were put on trial for murder. In Bradley Manning's court, you would be banned from showing that it was a matter of self-defence, because any argument or evidence as to intent is banned. You would not be able to show that the 'victim' is, in fact, still alive, because that would be evidence as to the lack of harm.
But of course. Did you forget whose show it is? The government has prepared for a good show. The trial is to proceed for twelve straight weeks: a fully choreographed extravaganza, with a 141-strong cast of prosecution witnesses. The defense was denied permission to call all but a handful of witnesses. Three weeks ago, in closed session, the court actually held a rehearsal. Even experts on military law have called this unprecedented.
Bradley Manning's conviction is already written into the script. The commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, Barack Obama, spoiled the plot for all of us when he pronounced Bradley Manning guilty two years ago. ""He broke the law,"" President Obama stated, when asked on camera at a fundraiser about his position on Mr. Manning. In a civilized society, such a prejudicial statement alone would have resulted in a mistrial. To convict Bradley Manning, it will be necessary for the US government to conceal crucial parts of his trial. Key portions of the trial are to be conducted in secrecy: 24 prosecution witnesses will give secret testimony in closed session, permitting the judge to claim that secret evidence justifies her decision. But closed justice is no justice at all. What cannot be shrouded in secrecy will be hidden through obfuscation. The remote situation of the courtroom, the arbitrary and discretionary restrictions on access for journalists, and the deliberate complexity and scale of the case are all designed to drive fact-hungry reporters into the arms of official military PR men, who mill around the Fort Meade press room like over-eager sales assistants. The management of Bradley Manning's case will not stop at the limits of the courtroom. It has already been revealed that the Pentagon is closely monitoring press coverage and social media discussions on the case. This is not justice; never could this be justice. The verdict was ordained long ago. Its function is not to determine questions such as guilt or innocence, or truth or falsehood. It is a public relations exercise, designed to provide the government with an alibi for posterity. It is a show of wasteful vengeance; a theatrical warning to people of conscience. The alleged act in respect of which Bradley Manning is charged is an act of great conscience - the single most important disclosure of subjugated history, ever. There is not a political system anywhere on the earth that has not seen light as a result. In court, in February, Bradley Manning said that he wanted to expose injustice, and to provoke worldwide debate and reform. Bradley Manning is accused of being a whistleblower, a good man, who cared for others and who followed higher orders. Bradley Manning is effectively accused of conspiracy to commit journalism. But this is not the language the prosecution uses. The most serious charge against Bradley Manning is that he ""aided the enemy"" - a capital offence that should require the greatest gravity, but here the US government laughs at the world, to breathe life into a phantom. The government argues that Bradley Manning communicated with a media organisation, WikiLeaks, who communicated to the public. It also argues that al-Qaeda (who else) is a member of the public. Hence, it argues that Bradley Manning communicated ""indirectly"" with al-Qaeda, a formally declared US ""enemy"", and therefore that Bradley Manning communicated with ""the enemy"". But what about ""aiding"" in that most serious charge, ""aiding the enemy""? Don't forget that this is a show trial. The court has banned any evidence of intent. The court has banned any evidence of the outcome, the lack of harm, the lack of any victim. It has ruled that the government doesn't need to show that any ""aiding"" occurred and the prosecution doesn't claim it did. The judge has stated that it is enough for the prosecution to show that al-Qaeda, like the rest of the world, reads WikiLeaks. ""Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people,"" wrote John Adams, ""who have a right and a desire to know."" When communicating with the press is ""aiding the enemy"" it is the ""general knowledge among the people"" itself which has become criminal. Just as Bradley Manning is condemned, so too is that spirit of liberty in which America was founded. In the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendent now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/536553946405032/?type=3,2013-06-10 07:35:35,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_536192976441129,"Edward Snowden is about to become as famous as Bradley Manning.

Snowden is a 29-year-old former technical assistant for the CIA and current employee of the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. 

Snowden has been working at the National Security Agency for the last four years as an employee of various outside contractors, including Booz Allen and Dell.

The Guardian, after several days of interviews, has revealed his identity at his request. From the moment he decided to disclose numerous top-secret documents to the public, he was determined not to opt for the protection of anonymity. ""I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong,"" he said.

Snowden will go down in history as one of America's most consequential whistleblowers, alongside Daniel Ellsberg and Bradley Manning. He is responsible for handing over material from one of the world's most secretive organisations  the NSA.

In a note accompanying the first set of documents he provided, he wrote: ""I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions,"" but ""I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law, unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant.""

Despite his determination to be publicly unveiled, he repeatedly insisted that he wants to avoid the media spotlight. ""I don't want public attention because I don't want the story to be about me. I want it to be about what the US government is doing.""

He does not fear the consequences of going public, he said, only that doing so will distract attention from the issues raised by his disclosures. ""I know the media likes to personalise political debates, and I know the government will demonise me.""

Despite these fears, he remained hopeful his outing will not divert attention from the substance of his disclosures. ""I really want the focus to be on these documents and the debate which I hope this will trigger among citizens around the globe about what kind of world we want to live in."" He added: ""My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.""

He has had ""a very comfortable life"" that included a salary of roughly $200,000, a girlfriend with whom he shared a home in Hawaii, a stable career, and a family he loves. ""I'm willing to sacrifice all of that because I can't in good conscience allow the US government to destroy privacy, internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building.""
'I am not afraid, because this is the choice I've made'

Three weeks ago, Snowden made final preparations that resulted in last week's series of blockbuster news stories. At the NSA office in Hawaii where he was working, he copied the last set of documents he intended to disclose.

He then advised his NSA supervisor that he needed to be away from work for ""a couple of weeks"" in order to receive treatment for epilepsy, a condition he learned he suffers from after a series of seizures last year.

As he packed his bags, he told his girlfriend that he had to be away for a few weeks, though he said he was vague about the reason. ""That is not an uncommon occurrence for someone who has spent the last decade working in the intelligence world.""

On May 20, he boarded a flight to Hong Kong, where he has remained ever since. He chose the city because ""they have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent"", and because he believed that it was one of the few places in the world that both could and would resist the dictates of the US government.

In the three weeks since he arrived, he has been ensconced in a hotel room. ""I've left the room maybe a total of three times during my entire stay,"" he said. It is a plush hotel and, what with eating meals in his room too, he has run up big bills.

He is deeply worried about being spied on. He lines the door of his hotel room with pillows to prevent eavesdropping. He puts a large red hood over his head and laptop when entering his passwords to prevent any hidden cameras from detecting them.

Though that may sound like paranoia to some, Snowden has good reason for such fears. He worked in the US intelligence world for almost a decade. He knows that the biggest and most secretive surveillance organisation in America, the NSA, along with the most powerful government on the planet, is looking for him.

Since the disclosures began to emerge, he has watched television and monitored the internet, hearing all the threats and vows of prosecution emanating from Washington.

And he knows only too well the sophisticated technology available to them and how easy it will be for them to find him. The NSA police and other law enforcement officers have twice visited his home in Hawaii and already contacted his girlfriend, though he believes that may have been prompted by his absence from work, and not because of suspicions of any connection to the leaks.

""All my options are bad,"" he said. The US could begin extradition proceedings against him, a potentially problematic, lengthy and unpredictable course for Washington. Or the Chinese government might whisk him away for questioning, viewing him as a useful source of information. Or he might end up being grabbed and bundled into a plane bound for US territory.

""Yes, I could be rendered by the CIA. I could have people come after me. Or any of the third-party partners. They work closely with a number of other nations. Or they could pay off the Triads. Any of their agents or assets,"" he said.

""We have got a CIA station just up the road  the consulate here in Hong Kong  and I am sure they are going to be busy for the next week. And that is a concern I will live with for the rest of my life, however long that happens to be.""

Having watched the Obama administration prosecute whistleblowers at a historically unprecedented rate, he fully expects the US government to attempt to use all its weight to punish him. ""I am not afraid,"" he said calmly, ""because this is the choice I've made.""

He predicts the government will launch an investigation and ""say I have broken the Espionage Act and helped our enemies, but that can be used against anyone who points out how massive and invasive the system has become"".

The only time he became emotional during the many hours of interviews was when he pondered the impact his choices would have on his family, many of whom work for the US government. ""The only thing I fear is the harmful effects on my family, who I won't be able to help any more. That's what keeps me up at night,"" he said, his eyes welling up with tears.
'You can't wait around for someone else to act'

Snowden did not always believe the US government posed a threat to his political values. He was brought up originally in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. His family moved later to Maryland, near the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade.

By his own admission, he was not a stellar student. In order to get the credits necessary to obtain a high school diploma, he attended a community college in Maryland, studying computing, but never completed the coursework. (He later obtained his GED.)

In 2003, he enlisted in the US army and began a training program to join the Special Forces. Invoking the same principles that he now cites to justify his leaks, he said: ""I wanted to fight in the Iraq war because I felt like I had an obligation as a human being to help free people from oppression"".

He recounted how his beliefs about the war's purpose were quickly dispelled. ""Most of the people training us seemed pumped up about killing Arabs, not helping anyone,"" he said. After he broke both his legs in a training accident, he was discharged.

After that, he got his first job in an NSA facility, working as a security guard for one of the agency's covert facilities at the University of Maryland. From there, he went to the CIA, where he worked on IT security. His understanding of the internet and his talent for computer programming enabled him to rise fairly quickly for someone who lacked even a high school diploma.

By 2007, the CIA stationed him with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland. His responsibility for maintaining computer network security meant he had clearance to access a wide array of classified documents.

That access, along with the almost three years he spent around CIA officers, led him to begin seriously questioning the rightness of what he saw.

He described as formative an incident in which he claimed CIA operatives were attempting to recruit a Swiss banker to obtain secret banking information. Snowden said they achieved this by purposely getting the banker drunk and encouraging him to drive home in his car. When the banker was arrested for drunk driving, the undercover agent seeking to befriend him offered to help, and a bond was formed that led to successful recruitment.

""Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world,"" he says. ""I realised that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.""

He said it was during his CIA stint in Geneva that he thought for the first time about exposing government secrets. But, at the time, he chose not to for two reasons.

First, he said: ""Most of the secrets the CIA has are about people, not machines and systems, so I didn't feel comfortable with disclosures that I thought could endanger anyone"". Secondly, the election of Barack Obama in 2008 gave him hope that there would be real reforms, rendering disclosures unnecessary.

He left the CIA in 2009 in order to take his first job working for a private contractor that assigned him to a functioning NSA facility, stationed on a military base in Japan. It was then, he said, that he ""watched as Obama advanced the very policies that I thought would be reined in"", and as a result, ""I got hardened.""

The primary lesson from this experience was that ""you can't wait around for someone else to act. I had been looking for leaders, but I realised that leadership is about being the first to act.""

Over the next three years, he learned just how all-consuming the NSA's surveillance activities were, claiming ""they are intent on making every conversation and every form of behaviour in the world known to them"".

He described how he once viewed the internet as ""the most important invention in all of human history"". As an adolescent, he spent days at a time ""speaking to people with all sorts of views that I would never have encountered on my own"".

But he believed that the value of the internet, along with basic privacy, is being rapidly destroyed by ubiquitous surveillance. ""I don't see myself as a hero,"" he said, ""because what I'm doing is self-interested: I don't want to live in a world where there's no privacy and therefore no room for intellectual exploration and creativity.""

Once he reached the conclusion that the NSA's surveillance net would soon be irrevocable, he said it was just a matter of time before he chose to act. ""What they're doing"" poses ""an existential threat to democracy"", he said.
A matter of principle

As strong as those beliefs are, there still remains the question: why did he do it? Giving up his freedom and a privileged lifestyle? ""There are more important things than money. If I were motivated by money, I could have sold these documents to any number of countries and gotten very rich.""

For him, it is a matter of principle. ""The government has granted itself power it is not entitled to. There is no public oversight. The result is people like myself have the latitude to go further than they are allowed to,"" he said.

His allegiance to internet freedom is reflected in the stickers on his laptop: ""I support Online Rights: Electronic Frontier Foundation,"" reads one. Another hails the online organisation offering anonymity, the Tor Project.

Asked by reporters to establish his authenticity to ensure he is not some fantasist, he laid bare, without hesitation, his personal details, from his social security number to his CIA ID and his expired diplomatic passport. There is no shiftiness. Ask him about anything in his personal life and he will answer.

He is quiet, smart, easy-going and self-effacing. A master on computers, he seemed happiest when talking about the technical side of surveillance, at a level of detail comprehensible probably only to fellow communication specialists. But he showed intense passion when talking about the value of privacy and how he felt it was being steadily eroded by the behaviour of the intelligence services.

His manner was calm and relaxed but he has been understandably twitchy since he went into hiding, waiting for the knock on the hotel door. A fire alarm goes off. ""That has not happened before,"" he said, betraying anxiety wondering if was real, a test or a CIA ploy to get him out onto the street.

Strewn about the side of his bed are his suitcase, a plate with the remains of room-service breakfast, and a copy of Angler, the biography of former vice-president Dick Cheney.

Ever since last week's news stories began to appear in the Guardian, Snowden has vigilantly watched TV and read the internet to see the effects of his choices. He seemed satisfied that the debate he longed to provoke was finally taking place.

He lay, propped up against pillows, watching CNN's Wolf Blitzer ask a discussion panel about government intrusion if they had any idea who the leaker was. From 8,000 miles away, the leaker looked on impassively, not even indulging in a wry smile.

Snowden said that he admires both Ellsberg and Manning, but argues that there is one important distinction between himself and the army private, whose trial coincidentally began the week Snowden's leaks began to make news.

""I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest,"" he said. ""There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over, because harming people isn't my goal. Transparency is.""

He purposely chose, he said, to give the documents to journalists whose judgment he trusted about what should be public and what should remain concealed.

As for his future, he is vague. He hoped the publicity the leaks have generated will offer him some protection, making it ""harder for them to get dirty"".

He views his best hope as the possibility of asylum, with Iceland  with its reputation of a champion of internet freedom  at the top of his list. He knows that may prove a wish unfulfilled.

But after the intense political controversy he has already created with just the first week's haul of stories, ""I feel satisfied that this was all worth it. I have no regrets.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/536192976441129/?type=3,2013-06-09 17:30:37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_535925319801228,"Google has long been considered a monopoly with close ties to the U.S. government.

Now it is learned the U.S. military's powerful classified intranet is not being processed through government servers, but is being powered by Google.

The revelation came on the opening day of the Bradley Manning court-martial at Fort Meade in Maryland this week.

Manning, who is being accused by the United States government of downloading 700,000 documents and passing them on to WikiLeaks, gained access to the material through the military's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), a system of interconnected computer networks used by the United States Defense Department with its search facility provided through a browser known as Intelink.
 
Captain Morrow, chief prosecutor for the government in the case against Manning was explaining to the judge on Monday the workings of the SIPRNet and how Manning had systematically accessed it to gain confidential diplomatic cables and classified military files. 

He pointed out how Intelink logs could be used by forensic computer examiners to monitor Manning's movements ""minute by minute.""

In explaining what Intelink was, Morrow said:

""Intelink, Your Honor. Intelink is a SIPRNet search engine, very similar to Google, in fact powered by Google.""

On Wednesday Major Ashden Fein for the prosecution asked witness Chief Warrant Officer Two Kyle Balonek to put on the record what Intelink was.

""Intelink in a nutshell is the simpler version of Google,"" came the reply. ""It is a search engine that allows you to find sometimes quickly the information you're looking for.""

""And how did analysts use Intelink,?"" asked Major Fein. 

""For, I mean, if you couldn't find something you usually try Intelink first to see if you can pull it out without having to go in the databases and look specifically for one single report,"" said Balonek. ""If you had a numbered report you could look in Intelink and pull that single report without having to muddle through the database.""

""Was using Intelink a common tool used by the Foxes Shia analysts,?"" asked Fein.

""Yes, sir.""

Another witness on Wednesday confirmed that emails between military personnel, including from one analyst to another, are also being sent through SIPRNet.

While the Mountain View, California-based Google provides custom search engines for hundreds of thousands of websites, this is the first time it has been revealed publicly that among its customers is the military and intelligence services of the United States government.

It has since been learned the Google infrastructure powering Intel is the largest Google infrastructure outside that powering its own operations.

Coming at a time when an army private is facing up to 154 years in prison for mishandling confidential and classified documents, it is somewhat ironic that the US government itself is trusting the care of the bulk of its inventory of classified military intelligence to a large commercial organization that makes little secret of making use of personal and private information it has accessed from users.

The likelihood that Bradley Manning downloaded documents from a search engine hosted on Google servers is one concern. Of equal concern is that the US government itself failed to detect that 700,000 documents had been downloaded from its highly classified system, including 250,000 diplomatic cables in one day. Both Google and the US government have extensive monitoring and hacking detection tools yet the downloads not only took place but did so without Google and the Department of Defense knowing about it, let alone preventing it.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/535925319801228/?type=3,2013-06-09 03:05:52,1,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0

109808052412959_531408993586194,"Air of uncertainty is engulfing most matters related to Egypt. Since the Egyptian revolt started over two years ago, the country remains hostage to a barefaced power struggle with many destructive implications that have polarized society in unprecedented ways, perhaps in all of Egypt's modern history. And while in Egypt itself nothing is sacred and no one is safe from the massive campaigns of defamation, demonization and sheer lies that each political camp is launching against the other, Palestinians find themselves in a most precarious position.

Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in particular, are heavily dependent on their Egyptian neighbors. Six years of an Israeli siege, originally imposed to punish Palestinians for electing Hamas in an election viewed widely as transparent and fair, has culminated into a drama with international dimensions. This drama of course involved the Palestinians, but also Israel's traditional benefactors – lead, as always, by the United States - Arab countries, Iran, Turkey and more. Aside from the vicious nature of a siege imposed to punish a civilian population for making democratic choices, the siege has morphed to acquire multiple meanings. On one hand, it further cemented the division of Palestinian political elites, as the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority (PA) invested in ensuring the isolation of its Hamas political opponents. Notably, this took place after their brief but bloody encounters in Gaza in 2007. On the other hand, the siege positioned Hamas, whose survival was at stake, forcefully in a regional camp that involved Iran, Syria and the Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah.

The last development in particular was exploited by Israel in every way possible and certainly without much context. It subsequently attacked Gaza at will, killing and wounding thousands in the course of few years, in the name of fighting Middle Eastern radicals hell-bent on erasing Israel off the map.

Under ousted President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt served as a buffer zone for Israel and the US to isolate Hamas from the rest of the world. The Egyptian dictator also had his own reasons for isolating Gaza. Any success in Mubarak's neighborhood for the Islamists, Palestinians or others, would have constituted a threat and would have emboldened Egypt's own Islamists to expect or strive for a greater role in Egypt's undemocratic political institutions. Moreover, by tightening the noose, the Egyptian regime at the time had hoped to strengthen its role as a major player in the US Arab camp of 'moderates', in exchange for financial and political perks.

The Mubarak regime justified its incarceration of Gaza as its attempt at preserving Palestinian unity. The logic was flawed, but also clever. Under the auspices of the George W. Bush Administration and full Egyptian involvement, Israel and Mahmoud Abbas' PA had reached an agreement on Movement and Access at the Gaza-Egypt border in November 2005. Expectedly, the agreement was tilted in every way necessary to reassure Israel regarding its many security concerns. A European mission - The European Union Border Assistance Mission at the Rafah Crossing Point (EU BAM Rafah) – was hurriedly deployed to monitor the border. Those listed by Israel as 'suspects' were either turned back or detained. It was an Israeli operation conducted by Palestinian and EU hands, with full Egyptian cooperation. The Mubarak regime argued that opening the border under Hamas' authority was a violation of the agreement and would have further divided Palestinians. 

When Palestinian militants clashed in Gaza in 2007, resulting in the removal of Abbas' Fatah loyalists from the Strip's entire security apparatus, Abbas found himself on the very camp urging greater clamp down at Gaza's border, especially with Egypt. The latter enthusiastically obliged. As Mubarak erected a barrier and an underground wall around Gaza's 12k border, Abbas cheered him on. ""I support the wall,"" he was quoted in the Guardian on Jan 31, 2010. ""It is the Egyptians' sovereign right in their own country. Legitimate supplies should be brought through the legal crossings.""

Abbas of course knew well that 'legal crossings' between Gaza and Israel were meant to ration food and fuel for Palestinians in the impoverished Gaza, in ways consistent with Israel's position, as reiterated by the then influential Israeli official Dov Weissglass: ""The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger."" As for the other 'legal crossing' with Egypt, it had no commercial use, and it was heavily restricted even for individuals with health problems and students.

Following a lethal Israeli war on Gaza in 2008-9, known by its Israeli name Operation Cast Lead, Egypt moved even closer to the Israeli and PA position of choking Gaza. Gazans didn't expect Mubarak to allow the seriously damaged place to completely recover from a one-sided war that killed over 1400 people, wounded thousands more, and damaged much of the place's barely subsisting infrastructure. However, they did hope that Mubarak would open the border crossing on a more predictable basis; yet they watched in dismay as western security experts flocked to Egypt to fortify the Gaza border even further, before all of Gaza's victims were accounted for.

Things have not always been this bad between Gaza and Egypt. In fact, in past decades, Gazans saw a strong connection, a bond even, with historical, political, cultural and religious dimensions that made them in some respects view Egypt as their respite, their last lines of defense. Historically, Egypt, which fought bitter wars against Israel, as other Arab countries conspired or capitulated, was in control of Gaza between 1948 and 1956, and again between 1957 and 1967. Even after the Israeli occupation of the remainder of historic Palestine, the political rapport was never severed until 1978 when President Anwar Sadat signed the Camp David Accords. A second phase of those accords put in place a 'framework' that would turn Gaza, along with the West Bank into autonomous regions.

While many in Egypt fully understand that finding a dignified and lasting resolution to the humiliation experienced by Palestinians in Gaza is a must, as they remain confined to a tiny space with no political horizon in sight, some media pundits are callously fanning the flames against the Gaza population and their government. They might've forgotten that it was Gazans that lead the celebration of Egypt's January 25 Revolution and it was their resistance that kept the Israeli army at bay all of these years. Then, no one truly knew what sort of political outcome the revolution would usher in. Most Palestinians seemed happy that Egyptians were gasping the air of freedom, and truly believed that what was good for Egypt was as equally good for Palestine.

It is only obvious that neither Gazans nor their government have any vested interest in destabilizing Egypt. Palestinians understand that a strong, stable Egypt would have to immediately tend to some unfinished business, one being the Gaza siege, and the other balancing out Israel's untamed military arrogance in that area. Yes, Gaza has its religious zealots like any other place, but conflating that with a Hamas-Muslim Brotherhood plot to undermine the army's presence in Sinai is another unsubstantiated claim aimed solely at fomenting hate against Palestinians.

When media reports confirmed the release of seven kidnapped Egyptian soldiers in Sinai that were received by President Mohamed Morsi at the Almatha airport on May 22, it was the Palestinians in Gaza who echoed the cheers of their brethren in Egypt. Aside from genuine gratification of their release, Gazans were also happy to see thousands of stranded passengers being allowed to cross the border after having spent six days fighting the elements and sleeping on card board.

Palestinians in Gaza feel humiliated and are deeply frustrated for paying the price of Egypt's protracted political turmoil. It is time that the Muslim Brotherhood government of Morsi do some serious soul-searching and understand that Palestinians will continue to dig tunnels to survive if Cairo doesn't reach an agreement with the Gaza government that would allow for commercial exchange and humanitarian relief.

Yes, Egypt has every right to secure its border, but certainly not at the expense of a besieged people who are tired of being subjected to 'collective punishment' or being used as political fodder. Additionally, they are most certainly tired of digging tunnels to survive.

109808052412959_529525720441188,"It is an event ""of cosmic proportions"", said one Palestinian academic, a befitting description of Stephen Hawking's decision to boycott an Israeli academic conference slated for next June. It was also a decisive moral call which was communicated by the Cambridge University, where Hawking is a professor, on May 8. 

Hawking is a world-renowned cosmologist and physicist. His scientific work had the kind of impact that redefined or challenged entire areas of research from the theory of relatively, to quantum mechanics, to other fields of study. This towering figure is also wheelchair-bound – suffering from complete physical paralyses caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease. For Hawking, however, such a painful fact seems like a mere side note in the face of his incredible contributions to science, ones that are comparable to only few men and women throughout history. 

What is considered a prestigious scientific conference in Israel is hosted by President Shimon Peres, most remembered by Lebanese and Palestinians for ordering the shelling of a United Nations compound near the village of Qana in South Lebanon in 1996. The compound was a safe heaven, where civilians often sought shelter during Israeli strikes. Not that time around, however. 106 innocent people, mostly children and women were killed and 116 wounded, including UN forces. That harrowing event alone would have sent Peres, then Israel's prime minister to serve his remaining years in jail. But of course, Israel is above the law, or so the Israeli government believes and consistently behaved in the last 65 years at a price tag of uncountable lives, untold destruction and protracted suffering of entire nations. 

Hawking's response to the boycott call was immensely important. The man's legendary status aside, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has proved more durable and successful than its detractors – mostly Israel's apologists – want to believe. Hawking's decision was also a testament that reason and morality should and must go hand in hand. Israel's boasting of its scientific accomplishments should mean zilch if such technology is put to work to advance state violence, tighten military occupation, and make killer drones available to other countries, thus exporting violence and mayhem. That very 'science' was used in abundance in Israel's latest two wars on Gaza (2008-09 and 2012) which claimed thousands of lives between dead and wounded. 

Cambridge University, perhaps wary of a possible backlash, tried to mask Hawking's decision as one that is compelled by health reasons, which, of course, was not the case at all. The university eventually retracted the statement, for the British scientist wished to make his decision crystal clear. The British Guardian newspaper reported on Hawking's rebuff of the conference, citing a statement by the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine, itself coordinated with Hawking's office: 

""We understand that Professor Stephen Hawking has declined his invitation to attend the Israeli Presidential Conference Facing Tomorrow 2013, due to take place in Jerusalem on 18-20 June. This is his independent decision to respect the boycott, based upon his knowledge of Palestine, and on the unanimous advice of his own academic contacts there."" 

Unlike other acts of boycott, sometimes dismissed by Israeli officials as insignificant, this one was manifestly shocking for Israel. Yigal Palmor, spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry was quoted by the New York Times saying ""never has a scientist of this stature boycotted Israel."" 

And since it was unexpected, Hawking's respect of the boycott generated disorganized Israeli and pro-Israeli responses, ranging from demeaning jokes and insults pertaining to his illness, unwarranted accusations and even shaming him for using technology supposedly developed in Israel to combat his deteriorating ALS condition. 

Never before has the country lost control over its carefully tailored narrative of its military occupation and violations of human rights in Palestine as is the case these days. While on one hand, Israeli officials speak of 'peace', they continue to issue tenders to build more settlements or expand existing ones, all built illegally on Palestinian land. On the very day that Hawking's decision to boycott the conference was announced, 'civil administration' in Israel agreed to the construction of 296 new housing units in the illegal settlement of Beit El, thus entrenching military occupation and ethnic cleansing. Israeli officials and media still insist that there are no links whatsoever between such stark violations of international and humanitarian law and the rising boycott movement. They indefatigably accuse their critics of 'anti-Semitism' (which is hardly affective anymore) and warn of attempts at the 'de-legitimatization' of Israel, as if they expect the world to remain completely oblivious to its perpetual war crimes, illegal occupation and institutionalized discrimination against non-Jewish inhabitants of Palestine and Israel.  

The dialectics of Hawking's decision are also important. It is a proof that civil society remains relevant and can be affective, and that official venues are not the only platforms in which the occupation of Palestine can be discussed and justly addressed. Nearly 20-years have passed since the Oslo Accords were signed, yet the Israeli occupation seems much more rooted than it was in 1993. 

There is little doubt that the boycott movement is in constant growth, and not simply because of the recurring news of artists and academics refusing to visit Israel, or to take part in Israeli-sponsored events. Equally significant is the existence of strong layers of support, provided by civil society that makes it possible for artists, academics, and others to adhere to the call of boycott, without fearing serious repercussions. 

It was revealed that a letter to Hawking, aimed at dissuading him from joining the conference was signed by 20 academics from many universities, including MIT, Cambridge, London, Leeds, Southampton, Warwick, Newcastle, etc. The professors told Hawking they were 'surprised and deeply disappointed' that he had agreed to take part in the conference, which is also to be attended by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former US President Bill Clinton, each with his own record of war crimes accusations spanning from Sudan, to Afghanistan, to Iraq. 

But criticism of Hawking is not only emanating from Israel and its predictable circle of diehard supporters, but it is also coming from those who count themselves as members of the Palestinian solidarity camp. The latter group, which is shrinking in number and outreach, argue that boycotting all aspects of Israel's academic, cultural and political life will play into Israel's 'anti-Semitism' and 'de-legitimization' arguments.  

But can the solidarity movement limit its boycott to few Israeli companies with links to West Bank settlements and expect to achieve tangible, long term results? Those who think that boycotting the occupation is enough, seem not to understand the nature of the relationship between West Bank setters and the Israeli government. Israel treats the settlements and its well-armed inhabitants as part and parcel of the Israeli state and economy. They are residents of Israel, even if they live near Ramallah. There is no separation whatsoever except of some imaginary 'Green Lines' and such. And now with the Apartheid Wall, even that separation is being blurred and redefined.

Palestinians in Gaza or Nablus don't see any difference between a solider who lives in an illegal Jewish settlement or another who lives inside Israel. They are all capable of committing murder, as many surely have, unhampered by geography or borders. International civil society too should not fall into the trap of illusory distinctions. This also makes Hawking's decision to boycott an Israel-based conference ""of cosmic proportions"". It is morally defensible and ethically sound, qualities befitting a formidable man of reason like Stephen Hawking.

109808052412959_525086794218414,"Mixed emotions in the Middle East today as Israel marks its 65th birthday and the Palestinian territories lament the loss of their lands. Pictured is how The Palestinian Post (now renamed The Jerusalem Post) reported the news. Big News Network is running an editorial from Gulf News, one of the major daily newspapers in the UAE, as follows:

For Arabs this is a dark day. May 15 is forever etched in the collective memory of all Arabs as Nakba  the catastrophe  where the Palestinian people were robbed of their lands and their birthright, dispossessed of their homes and pillaged of their place in their rightful nation.

Sixty-five years ago today, Israel became a Jewish state based on international collusion of a few and a national suppression of many. It is a state based on government-sponsored bigotry, racial discrimination and an absolute disregard for human rights and the rule of natural justice.

""The old will die and the young will forget,"" were the arrogant words of David Ben Gurion, the Jewish state's first leader. He has been lost to the march of time, his words shallow and insignificant.

The old still live and never forget that they were marched from their homes at bayonet point, forced into exile, condemned to camps in the hope that their memories would fade with the passing of time. They have not  they have just grown stronger.

And the young will never forget that they are the proud vanguards of a people that will once again work in their fields, tend to their olive trees and drink sweet water from wells in their own Palestinian land. For all men of good conscience, the illegal occupation of Palestine is a blight that will end through acts of civil disobedience, resistance and international assistance. 

The thousands who languish in Israeli jails, confined without trial, held without bail, scorn at the words of Ben Gurion: They do not die, they do not forget. The millions of Palestinians, spread to the four corners of the globe, hold the keys of their former homes as living proof that one day they will return to unlock the doors of a Palestinian state, where rights are upheld and justice is delivered  neither trampled by a conscript's boots nor bulldozed to make way for new colonies for Jews from abroad.

Their struggle is but 65 years young.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/525086794218414/?type=3,2013-05-15 01:01:45,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0
109808052412959_524842707576156,"Regular columnist Ramzy Baroud has written a great piece in Big News Network regarding Bangladesh's garment industry and what goes on behind the scenes to provide the world with cheap brand name clothing. The story is timely given that the death toll in the recent garment building collapse in Dhaka now exceeds 1,200. Following are some excerpt's from Ramzy's story:

Over 3.5 million people work in the country's estimated 4,000 factories, generating about 80 per cent of Bangladesh's total exports.

Some estimates put the monthly salary of a garment worker in Bangladesh at $70 to $100.

Other estimates are lower, considering that the country's monthly minimum wage hovers above $38.

Competitiveness is key, even if it is at the expense of impoverished people who have no other option but to accept miserable pay and highly dangerous work conditions.

.............most of the garment industry laborers in Bangladesh are women.

When one calculates the long-term loss brought on by the death of a mother working under inhumane conditions, no numbers, no statistics, no charts and certainly not Dada's quest to stay above the competition, could possibly do this tragedy any justice.

The story of Bangladesh's pain is dotted with tragedy, government corruption and unmitigated greed.

It also involves many companies and garment distributors in Western countries, China, the Middle East and elsewhere.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that in some way, our constant hankering for cheap prices, untamable desire for ""good deals"" and lust after brand names is happening at the expense of the sweat, blood, tears and in some cases, the crushed bones of cheap laborers.

Walmart, Gap, JCP, Abercrombie, Kohl's and many more are very much part and parcel of this story. Some of these companies still refuse to take any real action to avoid future tragedies.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/524842707576156/?type=3,2013-05-14 11:59:40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

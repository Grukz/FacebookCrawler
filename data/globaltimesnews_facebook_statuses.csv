From this day on, winter gray is gradually replaced by springtime green, as the weather grows progressively warmer. 

On this day, Chinese people usually observe the custom of ""yaochun,"" or ""biting spring,"" by eating radishes and fried spring pancakes known to many as spring rolls.

One tradition still practiced in some Chinese villages is whipping the clay ox. Villagers join together to whip the ox until it crumbles, scrambling to secure the clay crumbs so that they may sprinkle them over their farmland to help secure a good harvest.

""Before moving to China 30 months ago I had very firm ideas about the kind of country I was relocating to. In my mind I would stay for a year, take the experience as life enhancing and then flee-what I at that time perceived to be the more-negative and controlling aspects of Chinese society. Two and a half years later here I still am, half way through my grand scheme to visit every single province and with no immediate plans to return home. I love it here and I was pretty much incorrect about everything I once thought. Particularly when it comes to religious freedom in China.

I'd been led to believe that religion was suppressed in China but nothing could be further from the truth. In China people have the freedom to be as religious as they want. I have burned incense and circumnavigated holy temples with Buddhists in Chengde and Lhasa, prayed with my Chinese Christian friends in Kunming, and wished peace upon Muslims outside bustling giant Mosques in Xining.

So why the misconception? They say you should never talk about religion and politics but i'm about to mention both in one sentence. Religion and politics shouldn't mix and in China they can't. As an English/American atheist I truly admire this situation. In China you can be as devout as you want and nobody will stop you from practicing your faith. In the west religion is used to having a higher status in society, so perhaps there is a vested interest to portray China in a negative light by certain parties.

One of the great founding tenets of America was ""Freedom for religion and freedom from religion"". How lovely to see that in modern Chinese society this is more than just a political slogan. ""

Implemented 20 years ago, the ""custody and education"" (C&E) system purportedly aims to help prostitutes or their clients ""eliminate their bad habits and turn over a new leaf"" through education, labor and medical treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

With the country's abolishment of the ""re-education through labor"" system in November last year, many lawmakers, lawyers and STD experts believe that it is high time the similarly flawed C&E system was brought to an end.

The US Supreme Court in May ruled in favor of Monsanto against American farmers, saying that farmers couldn't replant patented genetically modified (GM) seeds as this would violate a licensing agreement.

After the ruling, global rallies against Monsanto broke out in 52 countries bringing together millions of activists on May 25. Chinese also echoed the global protests against the biotechnology company and some leading figures in anti-GM campaigns were allegedly detained, according to Weibo posts.

Monsanto's Chinese headquarters in Beijing got extra security on May 25, but no media covered the rally.

But in a local context, the most important question is this: How is the seed market in China and are food supplies secure?

Free markets and low investment levels will not solve pollution problems. Free markets allow pollution and, as non-polluting technologies are in general more expensive than polluting ones, low investment levels also worsen pollution. To overcome the UK's 1952 catastrophe, strict government regulation, and high levels of investment in non-polluting power stations and industries, was required. 

Given that this corresponds to the only economic way to deal with such problems, China will have to follow the same path. Hopefully, given its far larger population, China will never have to face a disaster on an equivalent scale to London in 1952 before such a course is followed.

Allowing non-local hukou holders to take the gaokao in the place where they live, rather than where they were born, is bound to happen eventually. The number of migrant workers in Beijing and Shanghai is increasing, and the calls for educational fairness are also growing. Forbidding migrant students from taking the gaokao locally can only worsen problems, which is no good for the two cities' development and social harmony in the long run. At the same time, such reforms should be carried out gradually so as to ease the pressure on local families. If their feelings are neglected, it will hinder the smooth implementation of the reforms.

Elegant, exquisite, mysterious, and exotic: these are some of the most common words called to mind when people think of orchids. Unlike other plants with more simple charms, orchids have a reputation as being ""intimidating,"" not only because they are difficult to grow, but also because of the sheer variety of the plant species and the high prices they can command.  

To many flower lovers, orchids are like people in that they long for understanding and the right hands to take care of them. 

And in the eyes of Alex Sánchez, an orchid curator from the Shanghai Botanical Garden, they are ""tolerant and resilient"" plants. ""Once you start to grow them, it is a hobby you can never quit. It is addictive,"" Sánchez told the Global Times.

Recently, officials, media and scholars in the US are discussing about rising of Chinese society's anti-US sentiments. They believed that China's anti-American sentiments can be attributed to China's large-scale patriotic and nationalistic education. Obviously, their arguments come from theoretical analysis instead of field studies. 

Unlike anti-Japanese sentiments, Chinese society does not have deep-rooted anti-American sentiments. Chinese people's negative feelings toward other countries are usually connected with the former experiences of humiliation caused by invasion of imperialist powers. Among those imperialist powers, the US' harm to China was the smallest. The hostile sentiments in the Cold War era have also been diluted by the normalization of Sino-US relations.

Chinese society's attention has been focused on the changes to Party secretaries in some provinces such as Guangdong and Zhejiang. The changes in the provincial leadership follow the 18th National Congress of the CPC and offer the public a fresh start. Their political achievements will surely influence the management of the whole province.

The population and economic scale of many provinces exceed those of middle-sized countries. As China is undergoing rapid development and social conflicts, the difficulties in managing a province can be much greater than managing a global power.

""When you can take the pebble from my hand, it will be time for you to leave."" This quotation is likely to bring a flood of memories to fans of the original TV series Kung Fu (1971-75) starring David Carradine. That show, and the rising star of kung fu legend Bruce Lee, lifted the veil from the secretive world of Chinese kung fu and propelled martial arts into mainstream American culture.

In following years, big stars like Jackie Chan in the 1980s and Jet Li in the 1990s inspired millions of Western boys to take martial arts training. And even though some of those boys grew up to create movies as popular as the animated Kung Fu Panda (2008), some Chinese believe that the film genre is merely capitalizing on people's stereotyped impressions about gong fu (the Chinese system of self-defense that stresses circular rather than linear motion).

It seems to be an endless fight for 44-year-old villager Wei Dongying. Having been fighting against the water pollution discharged from a nearby industrial zone for years, she now says she is giving up.

""It has been almost 20 years. The pollution is still there. What can we do? What's the use of appealing to them about environment protection? How many decades does one person have?"" Wei asked.

Wei lives in a small county in the Xiaoshan district of Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province, one of China's most economically developed areas. She said the pollution began around 1997 when Nanyang Chemical Industry Zone, one of the earliest industry parks in Zhejiang Province, was established near her village. ""Then everything changed as the air, soil and water all became polluted,"" she said.

The authority of the grass-roots governments is the foundation for the credibility of organs of State power. However, the current petition system is increasingly damaging the grass-roots governments' image and having a negative effect on the whole country. 

Petitions shouldn't become a heavy burden for maintaining stability. They used to be a complementary means to safeguard people's rights when China had limited rule of law. The good parts of the system should be expanded rather than stimulating conflicts between officials and the public.

However, there can be a number of constraints for the US to face in carrying out its strategy, which adds uncertainty to its mission and offers China room to react to it.

The congress is not only a decision-making event, but also an important platform for China's top leadership to continue carrying out political reforms. Socialist countries in the past have not formed a mature mechanism for handing over power, but the CPC has made a successful attempt. The peaceful political succession from the second generation of leadership to the third was particularly remarkable, and the transition of power from the third generation to the fourth was considered normal practice. This time, it is expected to be viewed as standard procedure.

The India-US-Japan Trilateral Dialogue was held in New Delhi Monday, focusing on maritime security cooperation, Afghanistan and Central Asia. In recent years, China has seen many such dialogues piling up.

In fact, their practical value is very low even if they somehow target China. China's rise is a tortuous process and the US by itself has found no ways to counter it, either alone or with other countries.  

To suppress China's rise, great financial support will be needed. The US cannot afford this alone but neither can Japan or India. As long as China insists on a peaceful rise, targeting China will not be a serious idea.

Until the 1980s, the dominant view on him was exemplified in a 1948 book by Chen Boda, one of Mao Zedong's secretaries, later to be put on trial for his own role in the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), 
which described Chiang as an ""enemy of the people."" Chiang's betrayal of Shanghai communists in 1927, when he massacred hundreds of his one-time allies, was depicted as the core of his corrupt character. But now views are changing.

However, this architectural wonder spreads over tens of thousands of kilometers through China's countryside. 

Built over 2,000 years ago, the Great Wall was constructed by dozens of dynasties in history including the Warring Period (475BC-221BC), the Qin Dynasty (221BC-206BC), the Tang Dynasty (618-907), until finally, the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The wall stretches 21,196 kilometers and snakes through 403 counties in 15 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.

Cucumbers sliced and diced by playing cards 

Sixteen cucumbers were cut into pieces by playing cards that were thrown from meters away. The feat was achieved by Ye Tongxin, 50, a motor vehicle administrator from Nanjing, Jiangsu Province.

 ""A card flies 50 meters in the first half second after I fling it"" said Ye. Traveling 50 meters in a half second means the velocity of the card is 360 kilometers per hour, equal to the pace of a high-speed train.

It took pains to master such a stunt, according to Ye, who spent five years practicing flinging the cards at cucumbers.
Ye appeared on China's Got Talent, cutting 16 cucumbers in one minute. The Guinness World Record for the trick is 18 cucumbers in one minute. ""My next goal is to break that record,"" claimed Ye.

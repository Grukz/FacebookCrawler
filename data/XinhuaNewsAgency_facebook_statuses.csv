The tragedy happened in a crowded square of Shanghai's gleaming Bund area at around 11:35 p.m. There are 25 female among the deceased whose ages range from 16 to 36, said the authorities of Shanghai, a metropolis home to a population of over 23 million.

Most of the injured are youths at around 20 years old with a majority of them being female. There are also college students and children, medical sources told Xinhua.

Police are investigating the cause of the stampede.

The Bund, a stretch of riverbank on the west side of the Huangpu River in Shanghai, is a popular destination for New Year celebrations, as historical architecture and skyscrapers along the river show dazzling lights at night.
   
Survivors described the stampede as ""horrific and hellish.""

Some said they were standing on the steps adjoining the major road and the sightseeing platform when the deadly incident happened.

""The steps leading to the platform were full of people. Some wanted to get down and some wanted to go up,"" said a witness who gave her surname as Yin. ""We were caught in the middle and saw some girls falling while screaming. Then people started to fall down, row by row.""

The woman said she covered two kids in front of her with arms in the chaos. Her own son followed her.

""When we brought him out of the crowd, his forehead bruising, two deep-creased scars on his neck, and his mouth and nose all bleeding,"" said the teary mother.

Dirty shoe prints were all over the clothes of her son when the 12-year-old boy came to safety.

""The crowds were in panic. We stood in the crowd, feeling squeezed almost out of breath,"" another witness surnamed Yu said. ""Some yelled for help but the noise was too loud.""

Other survivors said police rushed the scene and tried to pull out people stuck in but generally failed.

""The whole chaos lasted a dozen minutes, then some injured were seen being carried out of the crowd,"" Yu said.

Some survivors said the stampede was triggered when some started throwing coupons that look like ""U.S. dollar banknotes"" to revelers outside a bar in the windy night.

Witness Wu Tao said some coupons were being thrown from a building's third-floor window near the Bund and people standing along the river bank started to scramble for those coupons.

The coupon looks like a 100 U.S. dollar banknote with ""M18"" printed in the middle, a reference to the bar of the same name on the Bund.

Phone calls to the bar were immediately hung up after getting through.

Some said on social networking websites that they found pictures on the bar owner showing off those coupons before the incident.

But the blogger, who called herself Chaojidadadashabao_MissShen"" on Sina Weibo, denied she threw away any coupons in the incident.

Stampedes occurred in China mainly due to safety loopholes. In September 2014, six school student were killed in a stampede at a primary school in Yunnan Province after a stairway was blocked.

In January 2014, a mosque stampede killed 14 people and injured another 10 in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

The bone was later confirmed to belong to a takin that had died of natural cause.

Experts say the panda's appetite for animal bones may derive from the need to supplement calcium and calories during winter -- studies have shown that often middle-aged and elderly pandas suffer from osteoporosis, a bone disease related to insufficient calcium intake.

   Xinhua compiled a list of 26 key words that highlight the fruits borne by the historic meetings. Let's continue with N to Z.

   N
   New normal
   In his speech at the APEC CEO Summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping, for the first time, sketched out a full picture of the Chinese economy's ""new norm"", which was characterized by ""medium-to-high speed growth"", ""constantly improved and upgraded economic structure"" and ""increasingly driven by innovation instead of input and investment.""

   O
   Opportunities
   In the wake of the global financial crisis, the APEC leaders have pinned down five areas for future growth, including economic reform, new economy, innovative growth, inclusive support and urbanization.

   P
   Partnership
   Partnership was the APEC buzzword. 
   ""Shaping the Future Through Asia-Pacific Partnership"" was the most comfortable common ground all APEC members could agree on. In a region home to the world's top three economies and other traditional powers, partnership acquired a new definition: ""Those who share the same ideal and follow the same path can be partners. Those who seek common ground while shelving differences can also be partners.""

   Q
   Quarter of century
   Twenty-five years ago, APEC was born in Canberra in the dying light of the Cold War. Under its auspices, the Asia-Pacific region has evolved from a geographic concept into a global economic engine that accounts for 40 percent of the world's population, 57 percent of GDP, and 48 percent of trade value. The APEC Beijing meetings are set to herald a new era for APEC and Asia-Pacific.

   R
   Reform
   Reform was on the agenda of the APEC Beijing meetings. All APEC economies, most of which are faced with growth bottlenecks, agreed that reform was a key tool to resort to in securing a successful post-global crisis era.
   APEC itself also needs reform to improve.

   S
   Silk Road Fund
   China will contribute 40 billion U.S. dollars to set up a Silk Road Fund.The money will be used to provide investment and financing support for infrastructure, resources, industrial and financial cooperation, and other projects related to connectivity for Asian countries.

   T
   Trade Roadmap
   The Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) process was officially launched during the APEC Beijing meetings, as the leaders approved the Beijing Roadmap for APEC's Contribution to the Realization of the FTAAP.   
   The FTAAP does not go against existing arrangements, such as TPP and RCEP, which are potential pathways to realize the FTAAP goal.
   
   U
   United States
   After being absent from APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting for two years in a row, U.S. President Obama attended the Beijing meetings before paying a state visit to China. During the meeting with Obama, President Xi urged both sides to push forward a new type of major-country relationship. Obama told Xi that the U.S. has no intention of containing China because it was not in its own interests.

   V
   Visa extension
   Under a new arrangement, China and the U.S. will issue multi-entry business and tourist visas with the validity to up to 10 years, and multi-entry student and exchange visas with the validity of up to 5 years to each other's citizens.
    
   W
   Wisdom
   A great era calls for a great vision, which in turn requires great wisdom. At the APEC Beijing meetings, ""China wisdom"" was highlighted in many ways. China was the top contributor to setting the agenda for the meetings, with more than half of the over 100 initiatives drafted by China.

   Xi
   Xi Jinping
   Chinese President Xi Jinping, who attended and chaired many events during the APEC meetings, won the most attention from global media. His book titled ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China,"" which was displayed at the entrance to the media center, was a hot book. Hundreds of copies -- in multiple languages including Chinese, English, French, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, Japanese and German -- were taken away by journalists everyday. The book is a record of speeches and instructions by Xi from Nov. 15, 2012 to June 13, 2014.

   Y
   Yanqi Lake
   This was where the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting was held. Yanqi Lake, at the foot of the Yan Mountain 50 kilometers north of downtown Beijing, means ""the lake of swan geese"". 
   Citing an ancient Chinese poem, President Xi said the 21 APEC members were just like 21 swan geese, meeting at the lake to enhance cooperation and embark on a new flight to shape a new vision for the development of the Asia-Pacific region.

   Z
   Zhong
   ""Zhong"" means ""China"" literally. The specially-designed outfits worn by APEC leaders and their wives at a grand banquet hosted by President Xi are ""new Zhong-style"" garments. In elegant colors from purple, green, crimson to brown, the suits and dresses were made of silk and adorned with elements representing China's rich history and traditions.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/941117909248987/?type=3,2014-11-12 21:20:06,15,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0

Xinhua compiled a list of 26 key words that highlight the fruits borne by the historic meetings.

   A
   Anti-corruption declaration
   APEC members have decided to adopt the Beijing Declaration on Fighting Corruption and set up a cross-border law enforcement network to strengthen transnational anti-corruption 
cooperation. They committed to working together against rampant corruption and deny safe haven for corrupt officials and their illicit assets in this region.

   B
   Blue
   ""APEC blue"" is a popular phrase coined by China's netizens to describe the blue sky in the heavily-polluted Beijing during the APEC week, which was a result of tough emission-reduction measures. The Chinese people hope  to make APEC blue a ""new normal"".
   
   C
   Connectivity
   APEC leaders approved the ""APEC Connectivity Blueprint 2015-2025"" to lay the foundation for all-round connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region, involving the construction of new roads, railways and shipping lanes; the slashing of regulatory constraints; and the easing of barriers to people-to-people interaction and mobility.
   
   D
   Dream
   After advocating the China Dream, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the fulfillment of the Asia-Pacific Dream of common development, prosperity and progress.  
   
   E
   E-commerce
   E-commerce and the Internet economy, a new engine for economic growth, was included in the APEC meetings' agenda for the first time. It's potential was on full display throughout China's Singles' Day, which coincided with the closure of the meeting on Nov. 11, when the online buying fiesta smashed records, with e-commerce giant Alibaba ringing-up sales of over 45 billion yuan (7.3 billion U.S. dollars) thanks to the world's biggest online retail sales day.
  
   F
   Fresh mission 
   APEC leaders have defined the fresh mission for the bloc in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, which is to smash a variety of ""shackles"" to embrace a new round of grand openness, communication and integration. 
  
   G
   Global value chains (GVCs)
   APEC leaders adopted a strategic blueprint for promoting GVC development and cooperation. This will help to better understand and support the ""trading tasks"" involved in adding 
value to cross-border final products, and contribute to the realization of a more effective policy and regulatory infrastructure for global trade.

   H
   Host
   This is the second time China has played host to APEC leaders in 13 years. Since the 2001 Shanghai meeting, extraordinary changes have taken place in China, now the world's second largest economy compared to the sixth back then. The meeting is set to reshape APEC and the world.
   
   I
   Information Technology Agreement (ITA)
   During the APEC meetings, the United States announced that it reached a consensus with China on resuming and finalizing negotiations on updating the World Trade Organization's ITA by including more products. It was confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.

President Xi Jinping on Wednesday outlined six priorities in building a new type of major-country relationship with the United States.

""China would like to work with the U.S. to implement the principle of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, cooperation and common prosperity and make the new type of major-country relations between the two countries produce more benefits to people in the two countries and the world,"" Xi told his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama at a meeting in Beijing.

""I will make joint efforts with President Obama,"" he said. ""I would like to keep close touch with him.""

The six priorities in China's diplomacy with the U.S. include the communication between high-level officials, mutual respect, cooperation in all aspects, management of disputes, collaboration in the Asia-Pacific and joint actions on global challenges, according to Xi:

-- China and the U.S. should improve exchanges and communication between high-level officials in a bid to improve strategic trust. The two sides should give bilateral dialogue mechanisms a better play, such as the China-U.S. Strategic and Economic Dialogue.

-- The two countries should respect each other's sovereign and territorial integrity as well as political system and development path, instead of imposing one's will and model on the other, which is the important condition and foundation for the two countries to have a healthy, stable and sustainable relationship.

-- They should deepen cooperation in all aspects including trade, military, counterterrorism, law enforcement, energy, health and infrastructure. The cooperation should involve governments, parliaments, media, think tanks and young people.

-- The two sides should manage disputes and sensitive issues in a constructive manner. As it is inevitable to have differences, they should always resort to dialogues and consultation and do not act against each other's core interests.

-- They should improve collaboration in the Asia-Pacific, having positive interactions, encouraging inclusive diplomacy and work for the regional peace, stability and prosperity.

-- They should jointly respond to regional and global challenges. China is willing to work with the U.S. on regional hotspots such as the Iran nuclear issue, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Afghanistan as well as global issues like counterterrorism, climate change and epidemic control.

""China would like to work with the United States to implement the principle of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, cooperation and common prosperity and make new type of major-country relations between the two countries produce more benefits to people in the two countries and the world,"" Xi said. ""I would make joint efforts with President Obama.""

Their talks took place at the Great Hall of the People in downtown Beijing, following a red-carpet ceremony to welcome Obama on Wednesday morning.

""Facing the current complicated and changing international situation, China and the United States should and will be able to cooperate in more areas,"" Xi said. 

Xi reviewed his meeting with Obama at the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage, California in June 2013, where they reached a consensus on building a new type of China-U.S. relations. 

The two countries have since then made ""positive progress"" in bilateral coordination and cooperation in various areas, Xi said, citing the facts that last year bilateral trade volume soared to 520 billion U.S. dollars, outstanding amount of two-way investment stood at 100 billion U.S. dollars and more than 4 million trips were made between the two nations. 

China and the United States worked together in tackling climate change, combating the Ebola epidemic and fighting terrorism, Xi said.

Facts have proved a new type of major-country relations between China and the United States serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples and helps maintain peace, stability and prosperity in Asia and Pacific and the world, Xi said.

Discounted fancy clothes, sparkling jewelry and high-end handbags have failed to cheer up 22-year-old Fu Jie from south China's Hainan Province ahead of Singles' Day on Tuesday, a holiday marked by an annual national shopping spree.

Like most lonely hearts, what the lovelorn young woman needs most on ""Double Eleven Day"" is a lover.

And on Taobao, China's ""you-name-it-we-have-it"" online shopping giant, there are plenty of ""lovers"" in store.

A real-life version of the science-fiction film ""Her,"" which depicts a lonely man falling in love with his computer operating system, is happening in China as ""virtual lover rental"" businesses gain popularity on Chinese e-commerce websites.

Customers can rent a girlfriend or boyfriend for a few days to offer sweet words, lend a patient ear, and other custom-made services, mostly through messaging platforms such as Tencent's QQ and WeChat.

""It's much safer to have a virtual boyfriend, and emotional care and support mean more to me than physical company at present,"" Fu said.

It costs about 20 yuan (3.27 U.S. dollars) a day to rent a virtual girlfriend or boyfriend, who are categorized into different types according to their personalities 
and characteristics, such as cuteness, maturity, optimism and gentleness, to cater to various customer tastes. The photos listed on the online storefront depict cartoons or movie stars out of privacy concerns.

A virtual girlfriend, also called a ""girlfriend in the cellphone,"" may call in the morning, chat online all day listening to a customer's stories and secrets, offer comfort or encouragement, and say goodnight before bedtime. Conversation via cellphone may require additional fees.

There are roughly 350 online stores with over 5,000 virtual girlfriends or boyfriends offering virtual lover services on Taobao. A popular online store named ""Touching You"" has served over 4,000 lonely hearts since it went into business in mid-August, with daily 
orders serving 40 to 50 customers.

Qualified virtual lovers should have a sweet voice, be an empathetic listener 
and talker, and sometimes a good singer, according to Xiaolu, owner of the store, 
which offers 40 virtual girlfriends and 40 boyfriends.

Li Zhe, a college student in east China's Nanjing City, has compiled a wish list for ""Singles Day"" on Tuesday, a holiday that has become China's busiest online shopping day.

""I come from a rural family and I am always very careful about spending money. Nevertheless, I will act like a shopaholic on Singles Day because the discounts they offer are really irresistible!"" he said, adding that he has been browsing the Internet to prepare his shopping list for the last two months.

Singles Day is said to have been started by several college students in Nanjing in the 1990s to celebrate -- or poke fun at -- their unattached status. The timing of the holiday on Nov. 11 each year is based on the four solitary digits in ""11.11.""

It has grown into the Chinese version of Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving in the United States promoted as an online shopping day. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group launched its first sales campaign on Singles Day in 2009.

Since then, Singles Day sales at Tmall, an online marketplace under Alibaba, have snowballed from 50 million yuan (8.16 million U.S. dollars) in 2009 to 35 billion yuan last year, about twice the sum for Cyber Monday in 2012.

""Last year, we saw a sales volume of 5.8 billion U.S. dollars on that shopping day, I don't know how much we will make this year, but it will certainly be a bustling scene,"" said Alibaba founder Jack Ma during a visit by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to the company's headquarters on November 7.

Alibaba successfully completed the world's biggest initial public offering in September. The company's share price rose to over 100 U.S. dollars in November, compared with 68 U.S. dollars per share in September.

Xiong Yan, a private fund manager in Guangdong Province, said, ""It is predictable that Singles Day will push up Alibaba's financial performance in the fourth quarter, and the rapid rise in the share price recently can be interpreted as a sign that the world's investors have taken notice of the significance of Nov. 11.""

Wu Sheng, an e-commerce analyst with the Ministry of Commerce, said Singles Day has turned consumption into a form of entertainment, which, for many people, is a means of emotional release. The popularity of mobile devices has facilitated the shopping frenzy, he added.

The Singles Day shopping spree is a reflection of the rapid expansion of China's e-commerce sector in recent years.

APEC serves as a negotiation platform following a non-binding principle. APEC not only heralds the regional trade liberalization but also drives WTO to break new grounds.

Obama
At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. President Barack Obama will pay a state visit to China and attend the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting from Nov. 10 to 12.

Partnership
This year's APEC meeting is under the theme ""Shaping the Future Through Asia-Pacific Partnership,"" underlining the aspiration that inclusive partnerships may be the greatest common ground APEC members can find.Analysts said the meeting will help pave the way for APEC members to bring relationships away from a zero-sum relation so that they can focus on promoting sustainable development.

Chinese President Xi Jinping told artists on Wednesday that they should not pursue commercial success at the expense of producing work with artistic and moral value.

Addressing authors, actors, script writers and dancers at a symposium in Beijing, Xi urged artists to create more works that are both artistically outstanding and morally inspiring, in order to serve the people and socialism and to present socialist core values.

Artists should not ""lose themselves in the tide of market economy nor go astray while answering the question of whom to serve, otherwise their works will lack vitality,"" he said.

Art works should not be the ""slaves"" of the market and should not bear ""the stench of money.""

Calling art and culture an indispensable contributor to the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation, the president said Chinese artists have produced many good works since the country's reform and opening-up drive, but warned that problems such as plagiarism and unoriginality still remain.

He said the status-quo of ""quantity over quality"" in art has created ""a plateau without summits"" and led to a cookie-cutter approach in production and consumption.

""Popularity should not necessitate vulgarity and hope should not entail covetousness,"" Xi said. ""Pure sensual entertainment does not equate to spiritual elation.""

He urged artists to create more works that have ""bones, morality and warmth"" --meaning works that advocate integrity, merits and compassion -- in order to provide the public the best ""food for thought"" available.       

Artists should be innovative and put the social benefits of their works before everything else, Xi said, adding that good art is intellectually and artistically successful as well as popular among the public.

""The true value of a masterpiece lies in its intellectual depth, artistic exquisiteness and skillful production,"" the president said, calling on Chinese artists to produce more works that ""disseminate contemporary Chinese values, embody Chinese traditional culture and reflect Chinese people's aesthetic pursuit.""

Academic and artistic democracy should also be promoted to allow for full discussions between groups holding different views, Xi said.

338109312883186_915956598431785,"(More added) China issues rules to manage local government debts 

China's State Council, or the cabinet, on Thursday published rules to strengthen the supervision and management of debts incurred by local governments.

It is the first document by the State Council aiming to manage and control risks posed by trillions of yuan in local government debts.

Auditing results indicated that risks from government debts are generally controllable, according to a brief statement posted on the official website of the Chinese central government.

But there are some risks and problems related to borrowing, management and fund use that need to be addressed, the statement said.

The State Council required the establishment of an integrated management mechanism for local governments' debts, which will cover borrowing, use of funds, and repayment.

Late last year, China disclosed its total government debts. Auditing results showed that debt directly incurred by China's local governments totaled 10.88 trillion yuan (1.77 trillion U.S. dollars) at the end of June 2013.

The debt guaranteed by local governments at various levels amounted to 2.66 trillion yuan. Debt governments might have some liability for, or contingent liabilities, stood at 4.34 trillion yuan.

Putting the three categories of debt together, Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei put total local government debts at about 12 trillion yuan at the end of last June. 

Four trillion yuan was borrowed through local government funding vehicles (LGFVs).

The State Council's statement came one month after the National People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese parliament, passed a long-awaited set of amendments to the country's Budget Law on Aug. 31. The revision marked an important milestone in fiscal reforms and 
paved the way for local governments to formally issue bonds on China's bond market.

The old version of the budget law banned local governments from issuing bonds. 
But in practice they sought back doors to raise funds by taking loans from banks and issuing bonds via their LGFVs. The money has been unsupervised.

According to the document, governments of the 32 provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland will be allowed to borrow within a quota set by the State Council. 

The quota needs to be approved by the NPC or its standing committee.

Prefecture-level and county-level governments can commission the provincial governments to borrow, if necessary.

The document requires that local governments no longer borrow money through LGFVs or corporate channels.

Money raised through municipal bonds may only be used to fund public services 
and pay existing debt, but not government operations. Debts arising from bond issuance must be included in the local government budget, the document said.

The State Council will set up a system for assessing local government debt risks and establish mechanisms for early warning, emergency response and accountability, it said.

Over the past two years, the market has been worried by China's rising debt burden and leverage. Local government debt exploded during the investment and construction binge that was part of a stimulus in 2008 to buffer against the global financial crisis.

The abolishment of LGFVs and allowing local governments to issue better-regulated municipal bonds will provide them with more transparent, stable and lower-cost sources of financing, analysts said.

Qiao Baoyun, professor with the Beijing-based Central University of Finance and 
Economics, said LGFVs had failed to fully demonstrate the government's credit, and issuing better-regulated municipal bonds is less risky in comparison.

The new document is set to help clarify several important principles on how to 
manage local debt, set rules and divide liabilities, she said.

   The millennium-old Chongyang Festival falls on the ninth day of the ninth month of the Chinese lunar calendar and fell on Thursday this year. It is an occasion for children to pay their respects to their elderly parents.

   Neither Liang's son nor his daughter were at home in Guangxi's Hepu County. They both work as migrant workers in neighboring Guangdong Province.

   Liang's wife, Cai Mingyu, who had leprosy, committed suicide by drinking pesticide in January after being frustrated with the illness and little care from her children.

   ""Although their work is not far away, they come back only once a year during the Spring Festival,"" said Liang, adding that the couple lives on a 2,000-yuan (325 U.S. dollars) annual living allowance from their children and a 55-yuan monthly rural pension.

   For rural elderly people, suicide is common, said Liu Jingzhen, a village doctor in Hepu County.

   ""Especially for those with serious illnesses or paralysis, suicide is 'good' for the children in many elderly people's minds,"" said Liu.
......

An elderly association was established in September 2012 at Silan Village in Yizhou City, providing fitness facilities and an entertainment center for the 317 elderly people in the village.

The association has invited the village doctor into the system to provide instant medical care on call for the elderly, said Fan Yushan, chairman of the association.

The elderly themselves have formed their own association and can take care of one another, thus reducing their loneliness and the number of suicides remarkably, said Fan.

Four similar elderly associations have also been set up in central China's Hubei Province.

Inviting private institutions to build elderly care facilities in the countryside is another approach, said Wei Huayun, an official with the Guangxi regional civil affairs department, adding that government-sponsored elderly care facilities are far from enough.

A photo exhibition covering China-U.S. collaboration during World War II in the China Burma India Theater (CBI) was opened in Beijing on Saturday.

The exhibition, named ""National Memories,"" displays pictures mainly taken by the 164th U.S. Signal Photo Company and later on collected by the U.S. National Archives.

Organized by Shenzhen Yuezhong Investment Holding Co., Ltd and the Charity Fund for Caring for WWII Veterans under the China Social Assistance Foundation, the exhibition is one of a number of non-governmental memorial activities in the lead-up to Victory Day in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression which falls on September 3. 

John E. Easterbrook, grandson of General Joseph Stilwell, who commanded the Allied Forces in China, was invited to give a speech at the launch ceremony.

He referred to General Stilwell's perception of Chinese soldiers as ""hardy and uncomplaining, accustomed to long hours, scanty food, hard work, sickness and wounds.""

""Yet they were able to make a joke of the merest trifle and remain cheerful under the most discouraging circumstances,"" Easterbrook quoted his grandfather as saying.

Deng Kangyan, chairman of Yuezhong Film & Television Co., Ltd, explained the motivation behind the show. ""When we dug into the WWII photos in the U.S. National Archives four year ago, we found photos featuring European battlefields were browsed by many people, but pictures about Chinese battlefields or the CBI were little-sought, coated by dust.""

Deng hopes that the pictures can ensure history is not forgotten.

Wars fought in the CBI theater were crucial to China's eventual victory in WWII as it helped secure the only supply route to China from the outside world, as the Japanese invaders severed all other channels. 

The exhibition will be held until September 9, at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution.

More than 5,000 people are to be relocated in northeast China to protect a colony of red-crowned crane, a species with a population of only 2,000 in the world.

The red-crowned crane is an important symbol in Chinese mythology, representing longevity and immortality. A common image in Chinese art is a hermit or reclusive scholar who cultivates bamboo and looks after cranes.

Zhalong National Nature Reserve in Heilongjiang Province, covering 210,000 hectares, is China's largest artificial breeding center for the cranes and home to about 20 percent of the population. Local people mainly live by fishing or by selling reeds.

""Several decades ago, the water was clean. Fish and avifauna abounded. We were not worried about our lives,"" said Jia Huifang from Zhalong in west Heilongjiang. ""But now the water level has dropped and the fish are gone. Making a living is harder than before.""

Human activity seriously affects the birds. The environment is deteriorating and people are taking away the cranes' food. In March 2005, fire broke out when farmers were reclaiming land, and destroyed much of the local marshy grassland. Fortunately it did not kill any birds. 

According to Wang Wenfeng, a manager at the reserve, the only way to stop the deterioration of environment is to move the villagers out; all 5,396 of them.

Over 160 million yuan (26 million U.S. dollars) of public money has been invested in the scheme and the search is on for land where the villagers can be resettled. The first batch are due to be relocated before the winter of 2015. It is not known when will the last batch be moved out. 

Most villagers support the scheme, but are worried. ""Our children need schools and our parents need  hospitals; that is why we want to move,"" Jia said. ""But what shall we live on if we leave this land?""

The local government solution is tourism: birdwatching and a spa. Guan Zhixin, Party chief with Halawusu Village, told Xinhua that 4.16 hectares of land have been allocated for more than 900 evacuees.

338109312883186_861899007170878,"Former military leader Xu Caihou is the latest among more than 30 heavyweight civilian and military officials downed in the country's fierce anti-corruption campaign.

Xu, former vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission, was expelled from the Communist Party of China (CPC) for bribery on Monday and may face prosecution as his case has been forwarded by the discipline agency to prosecutors.

Two weeks ago, authorities announced their investigation into Su Rong, then vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, who had served as Party chief of several provinces before. He is the most senior civilian official to be placed under investigation since the current CPC leadership took office in November 2012.

According to the website of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), around 30 officials of provincial and ministerial level or higher have been investigated for corruption since November 2012.

Among them were two members of the 205-strong CPC Central Committee and two alternate members.

Several were senior officials of central government departments, such as Jiang Jiemin, head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and Li Dongsheng, vice minister of public security.

There was one from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) -- Song Lin, former chairman of China Resources.

The majority of them were senior provincial officials and chief officials of provincial capitals such as Li Chuncheng, deputy party chief of southwest China's Sichuan Province, and Ji Jianye, mayor of Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.

Since February, at least two provincial or ministerial officials have been investigated for corruption every month.

Also on Monday, the CPC Central Committee decided to revoke the membership of Wang Yongchun, former vice general manager of the China National Petroleum Corporation. Although not a ministerial-level official, Wang was an alternate member of the CPC Central Committee.

In China's bureaucratic system, officials of this level and above are important decision makers about central and local affairs. They are no doubt ""tigers,"" a popular metaphor for senior corrupt officials.

Discipline inspectors have also tightened their grasp on low-ranking corrupt officials, dubbed ""flies.""

Based on the statements on the CCDI website, discipline inspection agencies across the country have investigated and punished more than 480 officials, with their full names published.

These officials were from 31 provincial divisions nationwide and their backgrounds range from party and government departments, SOEs to public institutions such as universities and hospitals.

Although there was a relatively small number of SOE executives under investigation, they came from almost all sectors dominated by state capital, from oil, telecom, power supply, steel to shipping and banking.

Also, the anti-corruption drive is gearing up in the military. Prior to Xu, Gu Junshan, deputy head of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, was charged with embezzlement, bribery, misuse of state funds and abuse of power in March.

Huang Weiting, a researcher with ""Seeking Truth,"" the official magazine of the CPC Central Committee, attributed the progress to the strategy of fighting both ""tigers"" and ""flies.""

Catching senior corrupt officials displays determination since these cases are usually tough nuts to crack, Huang said.

But punishing corrupt minor officials affects how ordinary people feel about the Party because, if a low-level official is corrupt, ordinary people see it first hand and may be hurt worse, he added.

""In many cases, tigers and flies are symbiotic. If a senior official is corrupted, it would be hard for his inferiors to keep clean. If there was a large group of low-level corrupt officials, it would not be surprising to find a big boss behind them,"" he said. ""We can not take them down if we do not fight them both.""

The figures also indicate the speeding-up of anti-corruption actions. In the first half of this year, more than 330 officials were investigated or punished, double the figure of the whole of 2013.

At a CPC disciplinary watchdog meeting in early 2013, President Xi Jinping vowed to make no exception when it comes to Party discipline and law.

""Cases will be investigated completely and no leniency will be meted out no matter who is involved,"" he said.

Prof. Xin Ming, with the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, told Xinhua that the actions have proven the leadership meant their words.

The CPC is going to celebrate its 93th anniversary on Tuesday.

When Xi was elected general secretary of the CPC Central Committee on Nov. 15 in 2012, he told the press that the Party faces many severe challenges and pressing problems, including corruption.

""We must make every effort to solve these problems. The whole Party must stay on full alert,"" he said.

One and half years later, at a group study of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau on Monday, Xi continued warning the whole Party of its weaknesses and challenges while stressing strict management.

338109312883186_861098153917630,"In northwest China's vast sun-scorched desert, a camel train plods along the ancient Silk Road. The caravan bells sound as beautiful as they did some 2,000 years ago.
     
The 7,000 km road linking the Orient and Occident, was once jammed with caravans of Chinese silk, Indian spices and Persian brocade. Now the camels carry tourists from around the world.
 
""Those merchants must have been expecting a good price for their goods after all this hardship,"" said Beijing accountant Guo Ying, 25, after her bumpy camel ride.
          
Centuries after war and competition from sea routes brought decay, the Silk Road is rising again. 

It was along the road that explorers and pioneers -- most famously the Middle Kingdom's imperial envoy Zhang Qian and the Venetian merchant and traveller Marco Polo -- introduced to their own people the other side of the world.
 
Both East and West are looking again at the routes that maintained stability and prosperity from China to the Mediterranean for many centuries.
     
At a construction site in northwest China's Jiayuguan, Chang'an and Mitsubishi trucks haul construction materials for a new train terminal. 

The high-speed link between Lanzhou and Xinjiang will soon be launched and passengers will travel at over 200 km per hour, at least 20 times as fast as on camelback.
 
""Caravans are quaint, but we need more railways and air routes,"" said Lou Qinjian, 58, governor of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, at one extremity of the route.
 
Lou's weather-beaten face shines with passion and perseverance. One year taking office, his province has found itself much nearer the center of Central Asia. Shaanxi now trains at least 1,000 students from Central Asian countries every year. Lou has organized direct flights between Almaty in Kazakhstan and Shaanxi's capital Xi'an.
  
Some 1,500 years ago, merchants from Central Asia, the Middle East and Western Europe braved the Gobi Desert and nomadic bandits to arrive at Chang'an, the historical name of Xi'an, then the world's largest metropolis. Getting cargo across the border today is much easier.
 
At the northwest land port of Horgos, customs procedures have been streamlined as the vast landlocked west is opened to Asian neighbors. Cross-border trade with Kazakhstan at Horgos is expected to grow by 14 percent by December.
 
President Xi Jinping's proposed ""Silk Road Economic Belt"" revival project could involve over 40 Asian and European countries and regions with a combined population of 3 billion.
 
For Chinese retailer Huang Jie in Kazakhstan, Xi's idea is great news.  Over 20 years ago, Huang married a Kazakh man and started a store selling cooking utensils in Almaty, once a major logistic hub on the Silk Road. Almost all the goods in Huang's emporium are imported from China.
 
""They sell very well here,"" she said, evidenced by a daily turnover that can hit 9,000,000 tenge (around 50,000 U.S. dollars).
 
The caravan trade in Central Asia was mainly East to West from the 4th to 8th century, and dominated by the Sogdians, mostly from Uzbekistan. Uzbek Olimpiade, 52, is well known for his business acumen inherited from his Sogdian ancestors, and also for his mastery of Chinese culture, such as Kung-fu and calligraphy.
 
Olimpiade studied in the Confucius Institute at Tashkent and has been to China four times to learn Kung-fu. His latest epiphany is that martial arts and calligraphy share a lot in common. ""Even with Kung-fu, the ancient Silk Road would have been too dangerous for me,"" he said.
 
Residents of Byzantine capital Istanbul would have agreed with Olimpiade. The city was the starting point for numerous arduous trips along the road over past millennia. Today, products from east China's Yiwu, the world's largest wholesale market, are piled high in Istanbul's  Grand Bazaar.
 
Yavuz Onay, chairman of the Turkish Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is planning to make China a bigger business partner.
 
""I am endeavoring to be Marco Polo in the 21st Century,"" he said.
 
Onay gave up on universities in London and New York and went to Shanghai as a postgraduate. He now helps the Turkish to do business in China and brings Chinese investors to his country.
 
""To revive the Silk Road, we should have more camels installed with engines,"" he said. High-speed rail from Istanbul to Ankara and a Bosphorus rail tunnel between Asia and Europe are both part of Turkey's effort to make itself a key juncture on the new Silk Road. 

""We have been in action to connect Turkey with Central Asia and Europe, even as far as Britain, with high-speed railways,"" said Omer Onhon, Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey.
 
In southern China's Guangzhou City, Marco Polo also has his fans.
 
Among all the ports that contributed to the maritime Silk Road, Guangzhou is the only one where maritime trade never ceased.
  
Last year,  Xi proposed the ""Maritime Silk Road of the 21st Century"" along the less well known ocean route that linked the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
 
Yemeni expat Ali Ismail Mahyiddin has found his fate closely related to the maritime Silk Road which made Guangzhou -- his current home -- a cultural and religious metropolis.
 
""Everyone here is always ready to help me,"" he said.
 
Mahyiddin runs his own restaurant in Guangzhou, serving both Chinese and Yemeni dishes. The name of his restaurant, Saba, refers to the Yemeni dynasty at the time when the maritime route thrived and brought the Arabian peninsula into the early global trading system.
 
The magic of the Silk Road continues. Over 20,000 Arabians were living in Guangzhou last year, with over 1,000 enterprises, offices and restaurants. Thirteen years after his first encounter with China -- an accidental business trip -- Mahyiddin is now waiting for a Chinese ""green card"", or permanent residence permit.
 
""I hope to get it as soon as possible,"" he said. ""I am used to living here; this is my home.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/861098153917630/?type=3,2014-06-29 09:07:14,5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0

Gaokao, as the exam is known, is under examination, too. Increasingly criticized for its role in focusing the national education system on exam results rather than genuine quality, Gaokao is having its biggest overhaul since it resumed in 1977, the year after the Cultural Revolution ended.  

The keyword to Gaokao reform could be decentralization. Shanghai took the lead in running its own Gaokao in 1985, and now about half the country has followed suit, with the rest retaining the unified ""national"" exam.

In 2003 Tsinghua, Peking and 20 other universities were given limited rights to set their own admission standards, meaning five percent of freshmen were selected not solely according to their Gaokao scores. Applicants with outstanding performances in provincial or even international science Olympiads could earn themselves handsome credit and increase their chances of being enrolled by a prestigious university, even though their Chinese literacy or English might not be up to scratch. Extra credit can also come from artistic or sporting talent. 

Diversifying standards and opening the college door to a wider set of applicants with special talents was a good idea, but was scandalously  abused by some universities. 

Cai Rongsheng, former head of admissions at Beijing's Renmin University of China, was arrested a week ago on charges of receiving huge bribes. Cai was put under official investigation in November 2013 and Renmin suspended its private admissions for 2014 soon after. Cai is accused of taking over 10 million yuan (1.62 million U.S. dollars) to ""help"" students during recruitment. 

Gaokao is swamped by waves of doubt on admission transparency and fairness. Supplementary scores, in particular, have been put under the microscope.

Due to lack of supervision, what were once rights of universities to admit whoever they chose, turned out to be tradable privileges for those who could afford them and led to corrupt admission procedures, said Wang Feng, charged by the Ministry of Education with the task of reforming the system. 

Deng Xiuxin, President of Huazhong Agricultural University, criticized some practices in art exams. Random sketches are easily declared masterpieces by examiners bought off in advance. 

""People who are not art experts have no idea about the fraud,"" Deng, a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, said during this year's NPC session. 

Xiong Qingnian, of Fudan University, one the country's finest, wants third parties to watch over and evaluate the admission process. It will take time for his suggestion to come to fruition, but meanwhile, 31 education authorities have cut the items that earn applicants extra admission credit. 

In southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, first prize winners in national science Olympiads will no longer be given extra points. Guangxi started to readjust its policy in 2011. Winners of provincial science and technology contests and students who won merit for good virtue are no longer given extra marks.

Xiong Bingqi, vice president of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, welcomes the change. Education authorities have had to clean up these score subsidies which were such obvious fertile ground for corruption, he said.

Guangdong trimmed its items to six from 23 this year, meaning the number of applicants who can get extra scores will drop by more than 90 percent. 

""This has been well received by examinees, and is widely regarded as more fair,"" said Luo Weiqi, head of the provincial education department.

While these measures are all well and good, there are calls for preferential treatment for Gaokao examinees from rural areas where education resources and quality are often inferior. 
Urbanites enjoy far more social welfare benefits than the rural population due to the urban-rural dual system introduced in the 1950s.   

""For equity's sake, some compensatory policies are necessary to ensure rural student's rights and interests,"" said Chen Chusheng, vice president of the University of Science and Technology of China. 

During the annual NPC national session this year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang vowed to increase by at least 10 percent the number of rural students from poor areas enrolled in key universities.

For some rural students, Gaokao is a passageway to a new destiny through knowledge. Once enrolled, they become urbanites and no longer have to bear the hardship of farming like their parents, or become migrant workers like their peers who fail to make it.

338109312883186_846709825356463,"Voice: The Hague has no jurisdiction over sea dispute 

China's repeated rejection of Manila' s plea for arbitration in the dispute in the South China Sea is by no means defiance of the tribunal in The Hague. On the contrary, it shows China's respect for international law.

The Permanent Court of Arbitration this week asked China to submit evidence on its territorial claims in the South China Sea within six months for a procedural review of the suit filed by the Philippines.

The tribunal, set up under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), has no jurisdictional power over the territorial and maritime disputes in the region.

Though a UNCLOS signatory, in 2006 China filed  a formal declaration that invoked the opt-out clause of Article 298 of the convention. That, according to the rules of convention, entitled China to reject arbitration in disputes concerning  boundaries, historic titles, or military activity.

It is legally clear that the request by the Philippines does not fall within the tribunal's scope and Manila's request should be rejected. China will definitely not submit any evidence to the tribunal.

The Philippines obviously knew this when it referred the dispute to the arbitrator last year. Its claim is carefully framed to avoid the situations itemized in the opt-out clause.

For impartial observers, issues such as ""rights to exploit waters in a 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone"" and ""legal status of the islands"" raised by the Philippines are de facto issues of boundary and maritime disputes and do not come under UNCLOS arbitration. China's legal entitlement under UNCLOS should be fully guaranteed. 

It is fair to say that the arbitration request is more of a political farce than a legally meaningful act. The sole reason why the Philippines submitted the dispute to an irrelevant third party is that it wants to further complicate the situation and make its dispute more of an international issue.

When chaos and confusion reign, the United States finds much sought after opportunities to make a fuss and pile pressure on China.         

What's more problematical is that the Philippine arbitration request seeks a declaration that the nine-dash line China bases its territorial sovereignty on is inconsistent with the UN maritime convention. The line, declared by the Chinese government in as early as 1947 and clearly marked in historical documents, obviously concerns a matter of sovereignty and is not governed by UNCLOS. 

The correct way to ease the tension in the South China Sea has long been articulated since 2002 in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. 

China has no intention of taking part in the arbitration process, but prefers bilateral talks and resolving the dispute in a peaceful manner.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/846709825356463/?type=3,2014-06-07 00:46:03,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0

Mohannad Shalabi has come a long way from being a struggling migrant worker to being recognized by Chinese President Xi Jinping as a shining example of China-Arab cooperation.

When the 36-year-old Jordanian came to south China to seek work 14 years ago, his dream was to have his own restaurant like his uncle did.

Initially, Mohannad labored in his uncle's fledgling restaurant in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, barely making ends meet.

""I only made some 300 U.S. dollars a month,"" he said. ""My earnings were all eaten by my expenses.""

Despite obstacles, he began to settle in Guangzhou, where he would meet and marry his wife, Liu Fang, a Muslim hailing from east China. They tied the knot in 2001.

As Mohannad's uncle's catering business took off, the older man decided in 2002 to expand by opening a chain restaurant in Yiwu City in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Mohannad and Liu first managed it on his uncle's behalf then took it over themselves two years later.

One of the few Arabian restaurants in Yiwu, the small business, Aqsa, named after the renowned Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, was an instant lure for many Arabs in the locality, and managed to earn a good reputation as well as a surging number of customers.

But it was not roses all the way. In 2008, the financial crisis sent shockwave through the wholesale economy for which Yiwu is known, and the couple came close to bankruptcy.

After narrowly coming through the crisis, they gave the restaurant a complete reshuffle by changing chefs, the menu and the name from Aqsa to Flower, hoping to attract a more diverse range of diners.

It seems that the hard work has paid off, as the couple not only have their own popular restaurant, but also operate a foreign trade company that sells a variety of goods.

Amid twists and turns in the past decade, Mohannad has not returned home once, as he ""needed to work hard enough in China to live a better life.""

""My mother and two brothers often come to China to help with the business here in Yiwu, which I am truly grateful for,"" he told Xinhua.

Now with the loving wife, two young kids, friends and a good business, Mohannad said, ""My dreams to make it in China have come true."" He plans to buy a house in Yiwu to settle down.

Mohannad's story has inspired many. President Xi praised the young man's diligence in his address on Thursday at the opening ceremony of the sixth ministerial conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.

""I hope more people like me will grasp opportunities and make it here in this wonderful land,"" Mohannad said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/846113905416055/?type=3,2014-06-06 04:27:30,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

A Swiss 26-year-old has followed in the footsteps of one of the world's greatest explorers by being named a ""Modern Marco Polo and Doctor of Hangzhou.""

Liam Bates is currently on his first engagement in a position requiring him to do like Polo and promote east China's Zhejiang Province and its capital of Hangzhou around the world. 

He was chosen from thousands of candidates after a year-long competition run by the Hangzhou Tourism Commission concluded last week.

For the next 12 months, Bates will post stories of his travels around Zhejiang on western social media including Facebook and Twitter, earning a salary of 40,000 euro (55,500 U.S. dollars).

His credentials are solid. 

He first came to China on his own at the age of 16 and has studied kung fu, cross talk, and Chinese music. Also going by the Chinese name Li Mu, he speaks fluent Chinese and in 2010 won top prize in televised language contest ""Chinese Bridge."" He has since worked as a television host.

To start his new job, he was given a 15-day free trip to Hangzhou and its surrounding cities to retrace Polo's route along the Grand Canal, the world's longest artificial waterway.

Hanghzou was featured prominently in Polo's experience of China in the 13th century. The Italian was overwhelmed by the city, and referred to it as ""beyond dispute the finest and the noblest in the world."" His reaction aroused an enduring desire among Europeans to see Hanghzou for themselves.

PASSION AND CHALLENGES

Bates' tour has already taken in Yongfu Temple and Chinese tea tastings.

Bates loves Chinese tea. He admitted that the tasting was far more interesting for him than wandering around the temple.

The Modern Marco Polo should be helped by this identification with what facets of China are most interesting to foreigners today.

Tea appreciation is in many ways similar to that of wine in his home country, Bates explained. 

For him, tea is a better representation of Chinese culture and of more appeal to foreigners than traditionally popular China icons like calligraphy.

While Bates loves visiting China's many sites, being plucked from his comfortable TV job will have its challenges. He is expected to make more than 50 posts on social media during the 15-day trip, so he has to constantly be inspired by what he sees and come up with ideas.

Hangzhou is not as well known internationally as Beijing and Shanghai. ""It is difficult to introduce the place to foreigners,"" Bates noted.

He picked one example. ""Many Chinese told me Hangzhou is renowned for its West Lake. But Swiss people have access to thousands of beautiful lakes, so they're unlikely to show any interest in the West Lake.""

Rather than place all his focus on famous sites then, he plans to cherry pick things about Hangzhou and Zhejiang's lifestyle and culture that will be charming in the eyes of foreigners.

""Through only a few words and photos, I want to share some special details with people of the world online,"" he said. ""If they are interested in them, they will keep forwarding my posts so that Hangzhou becomes more known.""

Bates, who has the account ""Modern-Day Marco Polo - Liam Bates"" on Facebook and Twitter, also noted how lucky he is to have modern social networking platforms, where as the original Polo only had books.

MODERN MARCO POLO'S INSIGHT

Bates believes other Chinese cities can learn from Hangzhou's promotional strategy.

He also suggested the city government make every effort to improve travel services to attract more foreigners.

""There is much room for improvement in tourism facilities and service level,"" he said, taking the absence of English signs in many Chinese train stations and scenic spots as an example.

Though Bates has spent about 10 years in China, he refuses to be called a ""China hand.""

The quake hit Yingjiang County under Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Dehong at 9:20 a.m. Friday, according to the China Earthquake Networks Center.

Tremors were strongly felt in the county seat, where residents rushed to open areas.

According to a statement from the provincial civil affairs department, the quake has cut off electricity in Kachang township and Mengnong and Sudian villages, though communications have not been affected.

The provincial government sent tents, quilts, folded beds and mattresses to the disaster-stricken region.

Yingjiang borders Myanmar and has a population of 300,000.

Yunnan lies where the Eurasian Plate and Indian Plate meet, and the province is prone to quakes.

A 5.6-magnitude quake hit the same region a week ago, injuring at least 13 people.

In March 2011, the county was jolted by a 5.8-magnitude quake, leaving 26 people dead and over 300 others injured.

News of two Vietnamese men being sentenced to jail for taking part in deadly rioting in the country earlier this month seems not enough to dissipate public concerns and indignation in China.

At least two Chinese citizens were killed in the violence, and the Chinese government has since evacuated thousands of its nationals from Vietnam.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang on Monday urged Vietnamese authorities to immediately conduct a thorough investigation into the riots, severely punish the criminals in accordance with law, and compensate the affected people and companies for their losses.

Chinese scholars have noted that Hanoi must reflect on the root cause of the recent rioting in order to stay on the right track to further promote Sino-Vietnamese relations.

""The beating, smashing and looting in Vietnam this month is the result of a complexity of factors,"" said Pan Jin'e, a research fellow with the Academy of Marxism under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Pan said firstly, Vietnamese workers have long endured relatively low wages and have staged a series of protests over the past few years. Secondly, the country's sluggish economic performance, coupled with high inflation, has also contributed greatly to social dissatisfaction.

She said opposition organizations both within and outside Vietnam's borders are the main instigators behind the recent rioting, whose aim was to ""use the rioting as an excuse to disrupt social order, incite public aversion, ... and destabilize the governance of the Vietnamese Communist Party.""

Zheng Yongnian, director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, pointed to the close collaboration between Vietnamese opposition forces and the United States.

According to Zheng, compared with Sino-Vietnamese ties, the relations between Hanoi and Washington are much more complicated: on the one hand, the United States tries to win Hanoi's support based on geo-political considerations, while on the other hand, it also attempts to instigate a ""color revolution"" in the country.

Pan warned that mishandling of this month's anti-China rioting could have substantial impacts on Vietnam's economic development and political security.

Foreign investments will be the first to feel the chill, she said, with the shutting down of factories affected in the recent riots leading to massive unemployment in the short term, and loss of confidence in the country's investment environment in the long term.

In addition, relations between China and Vietnam could have enormous impacts on the latter's economy, which is highly reliant on foreign trade. Souring Sino-Vietnamese relations will translate to lowered trade between the two countries, and Vietnam's exports to other countries could be affected in turn, she said.

Furthermore, a weakened economy and massive unemployment would also imply social instability and eventually undermine Vietnam's ruling foundation, Pan said.

Zheng Yongnian also added that the anti-China rioting has greatly tarnished Vietnam's international image. 

He said Vietnam's economy is highly dependent on foreign capital, but the U.S. government does not have the final say in the country's investment destination choices, even if it wants to win Hanoi's support.

Noting that the United States itself is still coming out of an economic crisis, Zheng said it is China, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and other Asian countries that could invest in Vietnam.

""Over-reliance on the West will be fatal for Vietnamese authorities,"" he said.

The experts agreed that both China and Vietnam should focus on their future cooperation in the long run, and that the ball is now in the court of the Vietnamese, who should negotiate with China on topics such as joint development in a more open-minded fashion and with less hostility.

Their comments were echoed by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang, who called on Hanoi to take concrete and effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese enterprises and citizens in Vietnam.

""Only in this way can the international community resume confidence in Vietnam,"" he said.

Now, the English version of this best-seller by China's most popular science fiction writer is expected to hit shelves in the United States in October, China Educational Publications Import and Export Corporation Ltd. (CEPIT) announced Monday.

The masterpiece by Liu, an engineer by trade, has been hailed for its extraordinary artistic vision. Three specially selected translators, Ken Liu,  Joel Martinsen, and Eric Abrahamsen, have been working on the English version of the trilogy.

Ken Liu, himself a winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy awards, undertook the first part, ""The Three-Body Problem."" Some episodes in the book take place during China's Cultural Revolution (1966-76). Though the historical setting is unusual for science fiction, it serves to foreshadow later developments in the novel.

Both Ken Liu and Martinsen, who translated ""Dark Forest,"" have finished translation. Abrahamsen's translation of ""Dead End"" has yet to be completed.

According to CEPIT, the English version of ""Dark Forest"" is expected to hit the market in May 2015, while the translation of ""Dead End"" will be released in January 2016. The trilogy will be available both in paper and electronic forms.

It took CEPIT and its US partner, Tor Books, 17 months to complete procedures to sign a contract allowing for global publication of the novel in English.

""There was no best-seller in the science fiction genre in China,"" said Yao Haijun, chief editor of Science Fiction World, the largest sci-fi magazine in the world with a monthly circulation of 100,000 copies.

""Liu Cixin was the right sci-fi writer to make science fiction more popular,"" Yao added.

Selectivity, how sort of picky you are and how attractive you are to someone else,"" said Peragine. ""There's a ton of different measures you can be looking at here.""
   
Costumes and topics of conversation aside, Peragine said even the atmosphere is different from the norm.
   
""Here the motivation just seems to be: I just want to find someone that likes what I like,"" she said. ""So it's really fun to watch the speed daters go at it here versus at a depressing bar when they're just scared about being single forever.""
   
It's a win-win situation. The speed dating event not only helps the pair with their research, but also gives anime fans a much-needed service included in the price of their ticket. It's only in its second year at the convention, but the event's popularity is undeniable.
   
With only roughly 200 spots to fill this year, the event got more than 1,500 signups online alone.
   
""We have lineups, people waiting for two-and-a-half hours just to get a chance to speed date, so it's pretty crazy,"" said Maxwell.
   
The convention may be swarming with like-minded people, but Peragine said their event makes it that much easier for them to connect.
   
""I think people like the idea of being forced to actually make these connections that they're actually here to make, so I guess that's why it's super popular,"" she said.
   
Some of the patient singles who managed to grab a spot this year engaged in some flirty chitchat with 13 people of the opposite sex over an hour-long session.
   
It's not the most conventional venue for a speed dating event, but many who signed up said it was worth a try since it's not always easy to find someone who shares their passion for anime outside of the convention.
   
""I come from a really small town where no one likes anime except for like five people, and those five people- two of which are male- are all my best friends and it's like, I can't date you, you're like a brother to me,"" said one speed dating participant, Oasis Kauppila.
   
For hardcore fans like Kauppila, a love for anime isn't an option.
   
""If they hated anime I don't think we'd be able to live together because I watch a lot of it and read a lot of the comics and manga, so they'd hate me and I'd hate them,"" she said.
   
And while the organizers have yet to track the event's success rate in matching couples, the pair say they've witnessed it first hand many times.
   
""Every now and then you'll be at a Con and you'll have like a couple come and go 'Oh thanks so much, me and my boyfriend, we met like two years ago or one year ago at your event,"" said Peragine. ""Yeah this happens every now and then and you're like awesome, validation, it's pretty sweet.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/839390356088410/?type=3,2014-05-26 02:01:50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Five people died and another is missing in a flood in Qingyuan City, Guangdong Province.

As of 4 p.m. on Saturday, 649,000 people and 500,900 hectares of crops were affected by the rainstorms and 3,300 houses collapsed in the city, which caused direct economic losses of 1.809 billion yuan (293 million U.S. dollars), according to the municipal flood control and drought relief headquarters.

Qingxin District in Qingyuan has been worst hit by persistent heavy rain, which has caused four small- and medium-sized reservoirs to overflow.

Rain has flooded nearly 483 villages and 12,300 homes, toppled 45 houses and trapped 454 residents, officials with Qingxin District said.

In the district's Shitan Town, although floodwater has dispersed, more than 20,000 residents lack drinking water as a reservoir has been polluted, said Liu Minyi, an official with the township government.

In Qigong Township, Yangshan County, power supply has resumed in three villages and another 8 to 10 villages are expected to regain electricity tonight.

In Conghua City, also in Guangdong, four people died in the rainstorms and four are missing. More than 12,000 residents have been affected and seven houses have collapsed.

Power supply was cut off in 9,413 households in Conghua. It is expected to resume in the next two days.

As of 3 p.m. Saturday, 16 highways were blocked by the flooding in Guangdong.

In Guangxi, three people died and nearly 280,000 people were affected by floods as of 4 p.m. Saturday.

China is a strong champion of the Asian security concept and is working to put it into practice, Chinese President Xi Jinping said here on Wednesday.
   
Xi made the remarks in a key-note speech on a new Asian approach to security delivered at the fourth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia held in east China's Shanghai on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   
""China will take solid steps to strengthen security dialogue and cooperation with other parties, and jointly explore the formulation of a code of conduct for regional security and an Asian security partnership program, making Asian countries good partners that trust one another and cooperate on an equal footing,"" Xi said.
   
China is a staunch force for upholding peace in the region and the world, and for promoting common development, he said, adding that the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence that China initiated together with India and Myanmar have become a basic norm governing state-to-state relations.
   
The Chinese president told his audience that China remains committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and has completely resolved, through friendly consultation, land boundary issues with 12 of its 14 neighboring countries.
   
""Being an active participant in regional security cooperation, China is one of the initiators of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,"" Xi noted.
   
He said his country also advocates a new security concept featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and coordination, and supports the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the League of Arab States in playing a positive role in regional affairs.
   
""China and Russia jointly initiated an Asia-Pacific security and cooperation initiative, which has played an important role in strengthening and maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,"" he added.
   
China is working to push forward the Six-Party Talks and supports peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan, making unremitting efforts in solving international and regional hotspot issues through dialogue and negotiation, according to Xi.
   
Also, China joined forces with countries in the region and the wider international community to tackle the Asian financial crisis and the international financial crisis, making its due contribution to promoting regional and global economic growth, he noted.
   
He meanwhile vowed China's firm commitment to the path of peaceful development and the win-win strategy of opening up, and expressed China's willingness to develop friendly ties and cooperation with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
   
""China's peaceful development begins here in Asia, finds its support in Asia, and delivers tangible benefits to Asia,"" he stressed.
   
Quoting a Chinese proverb, Xi said, ""Neighbors wish each other well, just like family members do to each other.""
   
China, he said, always pursues friendship and partnership with its neighbors, seeks to bring amity, security and common prosperity to its neighborhood, practices the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and works hard to make its development bring more benefits to countries in Asia.
   
China will work with other countries to speed up the development of an economic belt along the Silk Road and a 21st Century maritime silk road, and hopes that the Asian infrastructure investment bank can be launched at an early date, Xi added.
   
He also vowed that China will get more deeply involved in the regional cooperation process, and play its due part to ensure that development and security in Asia facilitate each other and are mutually reinforcing.

She has traveled over 3,000 km along the Great Wall from west to the east, walking alone since 2008, the year of Beijing Olympics.

""By walking along it, I can learn not only about the Great Wall itself, but about the real China,"" she said.

Farmers fetch water from wells, plow field with cattle and cook on wood fires, things that are never seen in Beijing or Shanghai, she said. ""This is the very root of China. I hope more people can see this.""

The idea of walking along the Great Wall came to Berjas-Morales in 1999, when she was a nurse caring for an Alzheimer's patient in Australia.

""The patient had been to China and kept telling me about the country,"" she recalled, adding he was so depressed when he realized he was going to lose his memory that he could not stop crying until Berjas-Morales mentioned ""something very big and very important"" -- the Great Wall.

""I said to him, 'Max, if you stop crying, I will walk the Great Wall of China',"" she recalled.

Berjas-Morales had kept the promise in mind, but it didn't come true easily. In 2003, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. It took much of her energy and savings to fight the disease.

She finally left for China in 2007. In walking the Great Wall, she is raising funds for a cancer charity. The journey started at Yumenguan, northwestern Gansu Province, where the Wall dates from the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD).

""It was amazing. It's incredible that's still there after all these years,"" she said, adding that was the first section of the Great Wall she had seen.

On her journey, she carried little candles with her and lit one every hundred kilometers to acknowledge the people who built the wall. ""It was such achievement. It deserves a little bit of respect.""

Dating back to around 200 B.C. when the first emperor of Qin had fortifications built to stop invasions by northern tribes, the Great Wall has been rebuilt many times. As most of the wall sections were built in remote areas, walking alone is anything but safe.

Near Gansu's Anxi County, she woke up finding her tent surrounded by footprints of wolves. In the Gobi desert with a daily temperature difference up to 40 degrees Celsius, she did not dare sleep at night. There was one time when she ran out of water and got lost on her way to find more: ""Luckily, a truck driver found me and helped me call the police,"" she said.

She plans to finish the trip next November by walking around the Bird's Nest, the main venue of the Beijing Olympic Games, as a symbol of the Olympic spirit on her 70th birthday.

She has written poems on what she saw and how she felt along the journey, and plans a book.

Chinese authorities will forbid the use of the Windows 8 operating system (OS) in new government computers, a move to ensure computer security after the shutdown of Windows XP.

All desktops, laptops and tablet PCs to be purchased by central state organs must be installed with OS other than Windows 8, according to an online statement by the Central Government Procurement Center.
   
The measure only targets computers used by government offices, while the personal computer market is expected to stay unaffected.
   
Currently, most government computers run Windows XP, which has a 70-percent market share in China. But Microsoft ended support for this 13-year-old system on April 8, arousing safety concerns and appeals for domestically designed OS.
   
Despite major Chinese software security companies having promised to provide technical assistance to guard against risks, Windows XP users have remained fearful about potential dangers such as hacker attacks.
   
And the Chinese government obviously cannot ignore the risks of running OS without guaranteed technical support. It has moved to avoid the awkwardness of being confronted with a similar situation again in future if it continues to purchase computers with foreign OS.
   
Apart from purchase restrictions for central government offices, China will focus on the development of its own OS based on Linux, a move which An Yang, a security expert with Qihoo 360 Technology, said was a necessity although progress has been disappointing.

Some 4,000 Chinese nationals affected in the anti-foreign violence in Vietnam were heading home Monday from a central Vietnamese port.

Beijing dispatched four ships, each capable of carrying 1,000 passengers, from the southern Chinese port city of Haikou for the evacuation mission, and two more are on stand-by.

Meanwhile, China has advised its nationals against travelling to Vietnam due to safety concerns and suspended part of its bilateral exchange plans with Hanoi.

China's normal oil drilling in its territorial waters near the Xisha Islands has been disrupted by Vietnam, whose claim that the rig is within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) has no legal basis and goes against historic facts.

It is even more irrational for Vietnam to violently harass Chinese ships in the rig area regardless of their safety and allow domestic looting and violence targeting foreign companies and nationals.

China has strongly opposed and resolutely responded to these moves.

Since May 2, Vietnam has carried out intensive disruptions of China Oilfield Services Limited's normal drilling in waters of China's Xisha Islands. From May 3 to 7, Vietnam dispatched 36 vessels, including armed ships, to ram Chinese boats as many as 171 times. It also sent frogmen and placed many fishing nets and large obstacles near Chinese vessels, posing security threats to Chinese ships and personnel.

Subsequent protests broke out in Vietnam and escalated into looting and violence targeting Chinese enterprises and nationals, leaving two Chinese dead and more than 100 others injured so far. Firms from countries like Singapore, Japan and the Republic of Korea in Vietnam were also affected.

In a telephone conversation with his Indonesian counterpart Marty Natalegawa on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China's position on safeguarding its legitimate sovereign rights and interests is firm and clear and will not change.

Wang stressed Chinese enterprises' normal oil drilling activities in the Xisha Islands and its contiguous zone had started 10 years ago. He said the violent disruptions and barbaric ramming by a large number of Vietnamese vessels are the cause of the tense situation.

In an urgent call with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Pham Binh Minh on Thursday, Wang lodged a solemn protest with Vietnam and voiced strong condemnation over the violence. He demanded Vietnam immediately take resolute and effective measures to stop all violence and ensure the safety of lives and property of all Chinese nationals and companies there.

The Vietnamese side bears unshirkable responsibility for the situation. Its intensive, irrational disruptions of China's normal drilling regardless of legal basis and historic facts should be to blame.

The site of rig 981 is only 17 nautical miles away from Zhongjian Island, which is administrated by Sansha City, south China's Hainan Province, while it is 150 nautical miles away from Vietnam.

China's territorial sovereignty over the waters is based on the U-like line officially announced by the Chinese government in 1947 and the map of the South China Sea islands published by it in 1948, said Wu Shicun, head of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies.

The international community, including countries surrounding the South China Sea, did not raise any questions to the demarcation and thus acquiesced to it, said Wu.

Besides, Chinese sovereignty and rights over islands in the South China Sea are based on legal rights formed through earliest discoveries, administration and inclusion into its maps, said Wu.

Therefore, they are completely China's historic rights which are in accordance with international laws and protected by them, he said.

The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates and respects the ""historic title"" in delimitation of the territorial sea between countries.

Vietnam's current claim over Xisha Islands is seriously weakened by North Vietnam's recognition of Chinese sovereignty over the islands in 1958 and its lack of protest between 1958 and 1975, said Sam Bateman, a senior fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies of the Singapore-based Nanyang Technological University.

Bateman added that ""despite global commentary that suggests otherwise, a negotiated maritime boundary in this area would likely place the rig within China's EEZ even if reduced weight was given to China's claimed insular features.""

With the discoveries of oil and gas resources in the South China Sea since the 1970s, it has been the ""sea of richness"" in the eyes of Vietnam. According to reports of the Vietnam News Agency early this year, Vietnam's crude oil exports reached 7.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2013.

To grab resources, Vietnam has not hesitated to transfer many oilfield interests to attract Western capital and technology, and has illegally marked China's Nansha Island waters into more than 100 oil and gas development areas for public bidding.

Vietnam has repeatedly infringed and encroached China's rights and interests in the South China Sea by its fishing, occupation of islands and oil and gas development in China's territorial sea waters. 

The Vietnamese side's disruptive actions violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea as well as a series of international pacts regarding maritime security, and harmed the peace and stability of the region.

Despite this, China has exercised uttermost restraint and fully implemented the declaration.

The declaration, which China signed with ASEAN members in November 2002, says ""the parties undertake to exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability"".

As an ASEAN member, Vietnam has the obligation to promote the cooperation and dialogue mechanisms between China and ASEAN, and maintain  the peace, stability and propensity of the South China Sea region.

It is shocking that violence took place both in the intensive disruptions targeting Chinese drilling operations and its domestic riots targeting foreign companies and nationals.

The situation requires communication from both sides. It is urgent for Vietnam to calm down and respect China's sovereignty and jurisdiction rights and take measures to immediately stop all forms of violent actions.

It is hoped ASEAN members have a clear idea of the basic facts and work together with China to continue to safeguard the peace and stability of the South China Sea.

Vietnam needs to clearly know that one will ""lift a rock only to drop it on its own feet"" if challenging the Chinese government's peaceful development idea and determination to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Challenging will do no good in strengthening dialogue, mutual trust and coordination as well as jointly building a new Asia of peace, stability and cooperation.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/834831066544339/?type=3,2014-05-19 08:16:08,2,3,5,2,0,0,0,0,0

Contrary to an aggressive image painted by Vietnam and the United States lately, China has been quite restrained about what happened in the Xisha Islands last week.

The trouble started when Vietnam attempted to stop a Chinese company from drilling in waters 17 nautical miles (some 31 kilometers) from China's Zhongjian Island and 150 nautical miles from the Vietnamese coast.

Chinese companies have been operating in these waters for about a decade and the current operation is a routine continuation of that work. China considers the Xisha Islands and the waters around them an inalienable part of Chinese territory.

From May 3 to 7, Vietnam dispatched 36 vessels, including armed warships, to harass the rig and interrupt drillings, deliberately and rampantly ramming Chinese boats as many as 171 times. How a country should respond to such harassment in its own territory may vary, but China's response has not crossed any line.

According to Yi Xianliang, deputy director-general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, China communicated through diplomatic channels with Vietnam 14 times from May 2 to 8. Vietnam was asked to respect China's territorial integrity, stop all forms of disruption and quit the scene.

Clearly Vietnam did not heed China's request.

Islands in the South China Sea, including Xisha Islands, were first discovered, named and administered by China. China's historical rights were respected by international law and in fact remained undisputed until the discovery of oil in the 1970s.

To cut a share, countries like Vietnam have tried to muscle their way in. For instance, Vietnam unilaterally divided the waters around the Nansha Islands into sections and offered them to international bidders for oil exploitation.

Over and above oil matters, Vietnam persistently harasses Chinese fishing boats and has tried to occupy islets in the waters.

In face of these affronts, China has exercised great restraint and fully implemented the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which it signed with ASEAN in 2002.

By antagonizing China and making the situation more complicated by dragging irrelevant countries into the issue, Vietnam seems to be ignoring its duty as an ASEAN member to follow the letter and spirit of 2002 pact and maintain peace and stability in the region. The consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries on friendship, cooperation and sensitive issue also appears to have been forgotten.

Thirteen female soldiers stood in the PLA's honor guard at the east gate of the Great Hall of the People. With their male comrades, they were addressed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and visiting Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov.

""I feel so proud and lucky,"" said Cheng Cheng, one of the female honor guards who served as PLA Air Force flag bearer.

""Not only do we represent the army, but also the motherland,"" Cheng added.

It was the first time female soldiers have been used in the PLA's honor guard in its 62-year-long history, and also the first time that they have served in a diplomatic ceremony, said Li Bentao, head of the honor guard.

The first group of female honor guards, 30 in total, were recruited in February and underwent intensive training for three months. The guards are above 1.73 meters tall, and 80 percent of them hold college degrees.

Liu Haiming, political commissar of the PLA honor guard, said female soldiers and officers are playing increasingly important roles in combat, training and other military missions.

Rudd was speaking at the three-day 2014 National Chinese Language Conference in Los Angeles that concluded Saturday.

Known that most of the 1,200 audience are educators, especially those who teach Chinese in America, Rudd expressed his thanks and honor to them.""Because your position is much more important than mine or any one else who comes from the official class. Because the future really does lie in your hands.""

Rudd, who grew up on a farm in rural area of Australia, shared with the listeners his story about learning Chinese.

In the small country town where he lived in his early life, there was only one school of less than 200 kids and four teachers.

One day, his mother, a simple country woman, gave him a local newspaper with a large photograph in which a Chinese delegate took his seat for the first time at the UN Security Council. And she said to him: ""This is important for the world. Remember this day, and think about it in the future.""

The picture and his mother's words aroused Rudd's interest in China. When he finished high school, he went to Sydney and met members of the Chinese community there for the first time. Then he became ""slowly familiar with the warmth of their hospitality, the importance in their lives of centrality of family, the essential nature of community, and the veneration for an action culture.""

""Very soon I became deeply and profoundly interested in this part of the world,"" he said. He studied at the Australian National University in Canberra, majoring in Chinese history, Chinese literature and Chinese philosophy and he became proficient in Mandarin.

""In the in-dividing period since then until now whether I have either been a student, a diplomat, a business man, a foreign minister or a prime minister, is that China has been a common thing of my adult life, in all things I have done,"" he told the audience.

The National Chinese Language Conference is the largest annual gathering in the United States of teachers, administrators, and policymakers engaged in teaching Chinese language and culture. The meeting is co-organized by the College Board and Asia Society in collaboration with Confucius Institute Headquarters (Hanban).

The United States has the largest number of Confucius Institutes and Classrooms, with 100 and more than 360 ones respectively. More than 220,000 American students are studying Chinese in these institutes in 2014.

""The Confucius Institute is not just about language, it is about culture,"" David Coleman, president of the College Board, told Xinhua.

""The Confucius Institute and Confucius Classroom offer a model to build a trust (between China and America), because trust must be based on understanding. What a Confucius Institute does is that it invites students across this country to not only learn a language but to understand,"" Coleman said.

From 2013 to 2014, five new Confucius Institutes have been set up. They start to work with school districts around America to promote the learning of the Chinese language.

""The Chinese language and culture in America is growing very quickly. There is perhaps no relationship that would be more important in the future in our world than for China and the United States to begin to more deeply understand one and another,"" Coleman said. ""We see that American students recognize that it is powerful for their future to do good work, to explore the world, to understand Chinese.""

Apart from those educators who teach Chinese in Confucius Institutes or Confucius Classrooms, more and more common people in the United States are willing to learn and teach Chinese in the country.

Jessica Beinecke, a popular journalist in China for her online video program ""OMG! Meiyu""(literally, ""OMG! American language""), updates her video shows for teaching Chinese people American slang and culture everyday. Her daily online show has garnered over 40 million video views.

Beinecke recently launched a program called ""Crazy Fresh Chinese"" to teach American students one Chinese slang everyday. ""I want to empower my viewers with useful global skills and bring the Chinese language to life,"" she said.

Jason Loose is a 2012 graduate of Arizona State University. After his graduation, he had a chance to spend a year in Nanjing, capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province, studying Chinese and pedagogy. When he came back to America, he joined Thousand Oaks High School in Thousand Oaks, California, to teach the Chinese language and culture.
  
Loose started to learn Chinese in 2007. Talking about that, he said: ""I found China is somewhere that goes with a lot of change and somewhere in the middle of fast development when I was reading about it."" 

""Everyone who went there has learned so much and experienced so much. Sometimes they had even just changed a lot as a person. I didn't always see that happening of people who are studying other languages, it seems like Chinese is the one that happens most. It attracted me to learn Chinese,"" Loose said.

He loves to share his experience in China with his students and on culture days he would like to show them video clips on China to help them understand the culture beneath appearance.

""I have showed them a video about a Chinese person traveling home for Chunjie (Chinese Lunar New Year). They saw all the little things in the video that showed how important it is to be with your family on New Year day, how tight family relationships are and how important the family is in China,"" he said. ""That's what we called 'let the culture speaks first.'""

338109312883186_828760193818093,"Trading platforms struggle as more banks ban bitcoin 

As more Chinese banks closed bitcoin trading accounts this week, online platforms for the virtual currency's transactions are struggling to find a way out.
   
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China on Thursday said it had decided to bar trading activities related to bitcoin.
   
The previous day, Agricultural Bank of China, China Guangfa Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank all announced that they had banned customers from using accounts to trade bitcoin.
   
Announcements posted on their websites said that any institution or individual would not be allowed to use accounts opened in the bank for the deposit, withdrawal and transfer of funds for bitcoin and litecoin, another virtual currency, trading.
   
The purpose is to protect the property rights and interests of the public, maintain the legal currency status of the renminbi and prevent money laundering risks, the statements said. If customers break the rule, the banks will suspend and shut down their accounts.
   
Bitcoins, stored in a virtual wallet, can pass from person to person around the world in secret, allowing users to remain anonymous. It bypasses both banks and banking regulators worldwide.
   
As the crypto-currency has the potential to breed fraud and presents high risk investment opportunities, it has aroused controversy.
   
The bans followed a warning from Chinese regulators in December. Five government departments including the central bank cautioned people on the risks related to bitcoin and demanded financial and payment institutions not engage in transactions involving the virtual currency.
   
According to statistics released by Huobi.com, one of the leading bitcoin exchanges, transactions have dropped monthly since December. In April, the price and transaction of bitcoin in trading exchanges decreased 30 and 40 percent respectively on the previous month.
   
Five leading Chinese bitcoin trading exchanges, including BTC China, Huobi.com and OKCoin.com, released a statement on Tuesday, promising to restrain from excessive speculation and cooperate with regulators.
   
Bitcoin transactions of these five exchanges take up more than 80 percent of the total Chinese market.
   
""If China maintains tough regulatory policies, the price of bitcoin will definitely keep dropping,"" said Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi.com.
   
It is a matter of urgency for Chinese bitcoin-transaction online platforms to speed up overseas expansion. ""We are developing some overseas platforms right now,"" Du said.
   
Last year, China became the most active bitcoin market in the world. Exchange platforms have also attracted many international investors.
   
He Yi, OKCoin.com vice president, said his company started tapping into the overseas market at the end of 2013.
   
""But it does not mean we are giving up on the Chinese market. Going global was one of our original plans,"" he added.
   
The restrained bitcoin trading service in China has impacted the virtual currency on the global market.
   
According to statistics released by Blockchain.info, a popular bitcoin wallet, the global market value of the virtual currency has slumped to 5.6 billion U.S. dollars from a record high of 13.9 billion U.S. dollars in December.
   
In February, Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchanges, suddenly shut down in Tokyo after hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin had been stolen following a number of cyber attacks.
   
Overseas expansion is not easy, but insiders regard it as an opportunity.
   
Li Qiyuan, CEO of BTC China, said more exchanges may close down in the future. ""The market will select the superior and eliminate the inferior. Only professional exchanges may survive,"" he said.
   
People like Li still have confidence in the market despite regulations being adopted by countries worldwide.
   
""Bitcoin does not belong to China or America. It is a global digital currency. It will survive as long as countries allow trading,"" said Du Jun.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/828760193818093/?type=3,2014-05-09 07:36:05,2,6,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

338109312883186_827698257257620,"Chinese property developers face uphill battle

Chinese property developers face an uphill battle as decling sales and shrinking profits fuel worries of a housing bubble burst. 
   
Among the 117 developers listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, 61 posted shrinking profits or even losses for the first three months, according to statistics compiled by property agency Centaline Property published on Tuesday.
   
Total net profits of the 117 developers stood at 9.65 billion yuan (about 1.55 billion U.S. dollars) for the first quarter, down 27 percent from the same period last year, the data showed.
   
The results should not come as a surprise as China Vanke, the country's largest real-estate developer by revenue, posted on April 29 its first quarterly profit decline since 2002.
   
The Shenzhen-based China Vanke, widely seen as a bellwether for the residential market in China, registered a 5.2 percent drop in first quarter profits with a whopping 32 percent fall in revenue.
   
The disappointing performance came amid falling home sales nationwide. Official data showed sales of residential property dipped 7.7 percent during the first quarter to 1.1 trillion yuan, while sales by residential area contracted 5.7 percent to 178.25 million square meters in the same period.
   
Developers have also been languishing in the land auction market.
   
The top 20 developers by home sales have bought less land in the first four months. The value of the land they bought decreased from 60.1 billion yuan in January to 32.56 billion yuan in February, then continued to drop to 25.45 billion yuan in March to April's 13.3 billion yuan, according to Centaline Property.
   
Declining sales along with shrinking profits and land purchases all point to a property market that has lost steam.
   
Zhu Zhongyi, vice president of China Real Estate Association (CREA), attributed the weak figures for the first quarter to the high comparison basis for the same period last year and rigid lending.
   
Home sales saw ""explosive"" growth in early 2013, as people scrambled to buy homes ahead of the implementation of a new tightening measure on March 31 of last year requiring higher down payments and a 20-percent capital gains tax, said Zhu.
   
Added to the property market woes is a credit crunch for both developers and buyers, Zhu added. Stringent bank loans since the end of last year have dealt real estate firms, particularly smaller ones, a blow in securing their funding chain.
   
More supply of government-subsidized housing for low income earners has diverted a portion of demand and dented the market, said Hu Jinghui, vice president of the Beijing-based property consultancy Bacic & 5i5j.
   
The introduction of real estate registration nationwide has also contributed to the lukewarm property market, Hu said.
   
More low-income housing and credit tightening have locked real estate firms and potential buyers in a stalemate. Potential buyers are taking a ""wait and see"" attitude and the developers are wooing buyers with lower prices, said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at Centaline Property.
   
Suppressed demand and more difficult credit access have sent smaller developers reeling. A small developer in Fenghua in east China's Zhejiang Province went bust after it defaulted on a 3.5 billion yuan debt earlier this year.
   
Others that barely survived have resorted to price cutting.
   
In Hangzhou, a city that rests by the picturesque West Lake in Zhejiang, developers made price cuts in the hope of getting apartments off their books faster, a move that caused jitters that the bubble of the country's property market has neared its bursting point.
   
Some developers slashed prices by more than 30 percent, indicating pressure to clear their inventories.
   
The weak demand has also forced both government and developers into action. The city of Nanning in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region relaxed its policy on home purchasing in late April.
   
More second-tier cities are expected to loosen their grips over property curbs if demand remains subdued.
   
Most analysts interviewed by Xinhua said they expect the property market to continue cooling down this year, and housing prices in cities with large inventories are very likely to see more price declines.
   
Housing prices in first-tier cities and most second-tier cities are unlikely to experience ""big corrections,"" said Zhang of Centaline Property.
   
But this prediction is based on the presumption that the confidence of potential buyers in big cities will remain strong and the ""wait and see"" mood will not spread to more potential buyers, Zhang added.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/827698257257620/?type=3,2014-05-07 08:07:52,3,14,2,3,0,0,0,0,0

Analysts in China said the 1 billion U.S. dollars is only a placeholder for the funds it wants to raise. The actual amount could be between 15 billion to 20 billion U.S. dollars.

It is expected to be the biggest IPO in the tech sector since Facebook's 16-billion-U.S.-dollar offering in 2012.

It will also challenge Visa's 19.7-billion-U.S.-dollar IPO in 2008 to be the largest offering in U.S. history.

It is unknown whether Alibaba will be listed in the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

The 15-year-old Alibaba, which is part-eBay and part-Amazon, is the world's largest online and mobile commerce company. It had a gross merchandise volume of 248 billion U.S. dollars in 2013 on its three major trading platforms.

Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities Lulu Xingwana echoed the view of President Jacob Zuma who said on Monday that South Africa could see a woman president sooner than expected.

Xingwana said Zuma's remarks are consistent with the agenda of empowering and advancing women that the government has been pursuing since 1994.

""Indeed we agree that the country is ready for a woman president,"" Xingwana said in a statement one day before voters go to the polls to elect the next National Assembly and provincial parliaments.

""South African women have more than proven that they are capable to handle any leadership position that comes their way,"" Xingwana said.

She said the country has had two female deputy presidents before -- Pumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and Baleka Mbete, and South African women continue to hold key leadership positions in regional and international structures such as Chair of the African Union (AU) Commission Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who is the first woman leader in the history of the organization.

""Today the representation of women in Parliament is 44 percent and 42 percent in Cabinet. We have 55 percent women Premiers, 38.2 percent Women in Local Government, and 39 percent in Senior Management ranks in the Public Service,"" Xingwana said.

In his Monday press briefing in Johannesburg, Zuma said he would support the selection of a woman president.

The Mail & Guardian reported last month that Zuma and his supporters had indicated an interest in promoting either his ex-wife and chairperson of AU Commission Dlamini-Zuma or African National Congress (ANC) chairperson Baleka Mbete to succeed him as ANC president in 2017, and the country's president in 2019.

Both Mbete and Dlamini-Zuma have accepted nominations as ANC representatives in Parliament after the May 7 general elections.

338109312883186_827129350647844,"WeChat, or Weixin, a popular instant messaging service in China, risks losing its luster as users complain about bombardment by deceptive ads and excessive information.

The situation came to the public's attention when a business account put fake ads on ""Moments,"" one of the major functions embedded in WeChat, which allows users to upload photos and share their daily life via texts.

On Monday, authorities in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality busted a case in which a ""travel agency"" account told its followers on WeChat to ""Like"" its ads to win a free trip to Hong Kong and Macao, which was later proved to be deceptive.

Similar cases were reported in provinces of Guangdong, Sichuan, Shaanxi and Jiangsu, with unscrupulous businesspeople trying to lure customers with coveted promotions, but later breaking their promises.

WeChat, developed by Internet giant Tencent, allows people to send texts, photos, videos and voice messages over mobile phones. The application has earned a legion of fans in China thanks to its convenience, reaching 600 million users since its debut in 2011.

Along with fake ads, information overload on the app is forcing some users to escape the flood of daily annoyances.

Wei Kang, a white-collar worker in Beijing, said that he receives ""tons of messages"" from his colleagues in WeChat's chat groups, even on weekends.

Wei said that he spends about an hour daily replying to messages from his colleagues, and has to check WeChat every few minutes because messages from his boss might be among the sea of notifications.

""I feel like I have been kidnapped by WeChat,"" Wei said, jokingly.

Wei is not the only one bombarded by the app. Early in February, Huang Zhen, a professor from Central University of Finance and Economics, caused a buzz on the Internet when he announced that he would abandon all WeChat chat groups and ""try to find some inner peace.""

A survey in March by a newspaper in Shanghai showed that 66.67 percent of respondents had feelings of being ""kidnapped"" by WeChat, but most chose to put up with the barrage of messages and information.

The ""Moments"" section on WeChat, for instance, has waned in popularity as it has become a place for people to either share ads or ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" type articles.

""My WeChat 'Moments' are basically spammed by these every single day, which is quite annoying,"" a WeChat user screen-named ""HXfengai"" told Xinhua.

As urgency for change mounts, WeChat teams need to adjust their product design and services to break the bottleneck and retain users, said Zhang Yi, CEO of iiMedia Research.

Zhang said that WeChat development teams should step up efforts to consider feedback from users and try to understand what they truly need at the moment.

""It's hard to say how loyal users will remain to WeChat, but if the company can make adjustments according to users' specific needs, it may help retain many users,"" he added.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/827129350647844/?type=3,2014-05-06 07:35:22,5,5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0

Accompanied by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who is on an Africa tour, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and Chairperson of AU Commission Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma attended an exhibition featuring China's most advanced railway and aviation technologies.

The leaders watched a video from a large LED panel about the development of China's railway and aviation industries before they were shown around and briefed by Chinese technicians on the specifics of those models.

It is not the first time that Li promotes China's technology to other countries during his overseas visits.

In Romania last November, Li invited leaders of 16 central and eastern European countries to a similar exhibition on China's railway technology and other infrastructure and manufacturing equipments.

In Thailand last October, he attended the opening ceremony of a Chinese high-speed railway exhibition with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

In his speech at the AU headquarters earlier in the day, Li said China is ready to expand cooperation with Africa in building road, rail, telecommunications, power grid and other infrastructure so as to help the continent realize regional interconnection.

He said that Beijing encourages Chinese enterprises to form joint ventures with African counterparts in a bid to improve Africa's regional aviation industry.

The premier depicted a dream that all African capitals are connected with high-speed rail so as to boost pan-African communication and development.

Noting that China has developed world-leading technologies in this area, Li said his country is ready to work with Africa in an unreserved manner to make this dream come true.

Guang Z. Chen, country director for Ethiopia of the World Bank, said Li's proposal is a very welcome move because Africa has an infrastructure deficit while China has both the financial resources and the construction capacity to help meet the demands.

Africa faces daunting challenges in improving its infrastructure, he said, adding that great efforts should be made in this regard so as to push Africa's regional integration, which is key to the continent's competitiveness.

He Wenping, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China's success story in poverty reduction is remarkable and massive investment in infrastructure was one of the key factors.

Based on their own experience, the Chinese see clearly the importance and necessity of improving infrastructure in Africa as well as the great business opportunities behind it, she said.

China has a long history of aid to Africa, including in sectors such as rail. In the 1970s, it helped build the Tanzania-Zambia railway, which, with a total length of 1,860 km, has become a major corridor connecting eastern, central and southern Africa.

As of the end of 2013, Chinese enterprises had signed project contracts worth nearly 400 billion U.S. dollars with African countries. They have built over 2,200 kilometers of railway and 3,500 kilometers of highway in the continent.

China possesses a complete system of research and development, construction, equipment manufacturing and operation, and the country's railway technologies and equipments have been exported to many countries and regions in the world, he said.

By the end of 2013, the total mileage of high-speed railway in China had reached 11,000 km, equal to the sum of the rest of the world.

Ethiopia is the first leg of Li's ongoing four-nation Africa tour, his first to the ""Land of Hope"" since he took office early last year and the latest stroke of the frequent high-level diplomacy between the Asian giant and the promising continent.

""I am looking forward to an in-depth exchange of views on bilateral issues and issues of common concern with Ethiopian and AU leaders, and ready to promote further development of relations and cooperation between China and Ethiopia as well as the larger AU,"" the Chinese premier said upon his arrival.
 
He said that as both sides are committed to a profound friendship and the principles of sincere amity, mutual benefit and win-win outcome, they have made across-the-board achievements in their cooperation.  

During his stay, Li will hold talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, meet President Mulatu Teshome, and sit down with Chinese and African business leaders to discuss the China-Africa economic and trade cooperation.

The Chinese leader is also scheduled to pay a visit to the AU headquarters and deliver a speech there to expound his country's Africa policy and reaffirm Beijing's commitment to deepening the new type of the China-Africa strategic partnership.

Upon his arrival, Li spoke highly of the rapid development of the China-AU ties in recent years, as well as their close coordination and cooperation in international and regional issues.

The AU has become a banner representing the African nations' efforts to gain strength through unity, said Li.

In a joint interview with African media released Sunday before his departure, Li said the trip, which will also take him to Nigeria, Angola and Kenya, will be ""one of cooperation and solidarity on the basis of past traditions.""

""I will feel the deep friendship based on solidarity and mutual assistance between the Chinese and African peoples, see for myself Africa's dynamic economic and social development, and listen to the African people's description of their expectation for good life in the future,"" he said.

The premier added that he is more than ready to make concrete efforts to deepen China-Africa relations and advance bilateral cooperation in various fields for the greater benefit of both sides.

The remote village located a four-hour drive from provincial capital Faizabad city, 315 km northeast of Afghan capital of Kabul.

The natural calamity was triggered by recent heavy rains in the mountainous province.

Earlier in the day, Afghan President Hamid Karzai issued an order announcing Sunday, May 4, as a national mourning day to observe the catastrophe, presidential spokeswoman Adela Raz said in her twitter account.  

""There are around 1,000 houses in the village. Over 300 homes are buried. The rescue teams are still in the fear of mudsliding at the site until now,"" Dehqan noted.  

More than 2,100 people were reported dead following two mudslides within an hour on midday Friday, provincial government spokesman Ahmad Naweed Froutan told local media. 

No official statement was released by government to confirm the exact number of deaths as of Saturday night. 

""Our estimates show that hundreds of people were buried under the mud and rubble triggered by landslide. It has been very difficult to give you a clear number of deaths and missing now,"" disaster official Dehqan said.

More than 4,500 villagers were evacuated to higher locations in the area surrounded by muddy hills and are living in tents. Rescue teams and security forces are distributing food and clean water to them, Dehqan said. Over 230 tons of flour had  reached the village and would be distributed to villagers soon.

338109312883186_821233391237440,"Economists from China's leading think tanks have dismissed predictions that a possible property meltdown would trigger a crisis or even a crash in the world's second largest economy.

""It can be said that China's property bubbles are now the biggest risk in its economy, but bearish talk of a collapse of the whole economy smells of ulterior motives,"" Wang Xiaoguang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Governance, told Xinhua.

REASON FOR CONCERN
Concerns over China's housing market which had been sizzling during the past three or four years may be well-founded, as latest official data showed home prices continued to cool in some cities.

In March, of a statistical pool of 70 major Chinese cities, 14 saw home prices either decline or stagnate on a monthly basis, the highest figure since early 2013. The average growth rate of the cities dipped to the lowest level for the past 15 months.

After large expansion, it is natural that China's real estate market brims with risks, and, given the sector's ""great contribution"" to the economy, reining in property risks would be crucial to maintaining the health of the country's financial system.

Wang pointed to the close ties between the property sector and shadow banking as a major reason for concerns, not least because risks in China's financial system already started to emerge as bad loans increased.

Jia Kang, director of the Research Institute for Fiscal Science at China's Ministry of Finance, warned against the ""divergence"" in China's housing market.

""In big cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the risks of the property market are not so big. But some other cities which are experiencing falling home prices have to be careful,"" Jia told Xinhua.
   
DOOM-MONGERS
In spite of the increasing risks, economists said a full-blown property meltdown was unlikely, calling those foreseeing a crash in the whole economy ""doom-mongers"".

There has been no shortage of prophets who expect China's economy to crash. Former Morgan Stanley economist Andy Xie compared China's property  and stock markets to a ""horror movie"", which ""people like to watch, but don't want to be in"", according to a Reuters report earlier this month.

Xie is among the more moderate of the bearish voices that have called a 'China crash' since the late 1990s. Gordon Chang, a Chinese-American lawyer and columnist has been predicting a crash for the past 15 years or so.

Risks for the Chinese economy have been exaggerated. Even the crisis like the subprime mortgage one in the United States had not knocked down the U.S. economy, Wang Xiaoguang said.

""At least for now, the housing market risks are ordinary ones in the process of economic growth. For those describing the risks in a way to make people panic is totally out of ulterior motives,"" he said.

Concerning sharp declines in home prices of some cities, led by Wenzhou and Erdos, Wang said, ""At least for now, the risk exposure stemming from the two cities seems to be not so big."" 

As to whether the property risks would deal a lethal blow to the Chinese economy, Wang said, ""I don't think they are systemic risks. They are actually regional and structural risks.""

Yu Yongding, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, also dismissed China's real-estate price bubble as a catalyst for a crisis, as the down payment to buy a home in China exceeds 50 percent.

Given that property prices are unlikely to fall by such a large margin, and subprime mortgages account for 20 percent of the banks' total assets, the bubble's collapse would not bring down the country's banks, he said.

In case the bubble bursts, plummeting prices would attract new home buyers in major cities, causing the market to stabilize, predicted Yu, adding that the urbanization plan unveiled recently would also help prop up the market.

BAILOUT UNNECESSARY
Anticipation has been building recently for some kind of action to bail out the property sector. However, economists said it was not necessary.

""Developers had been building too much. Why not let them take the responsibility. Only after going through bubble-bursting can they learn to be more cautious. And the process of unleashing the risks is also good for the health of China's economy,"" Wang said.

He likened the property sector to a sick man who has to go through pain before recovering. ""In this process, you don't have to take any protective measures to artificially end the disease.""

Declining home prices in some cities might also be helpful to rein in speculation in the property market.

""The divergence of home price moves will be a good thing as that is how a mature market functions, and it will force buyers to be more rational and market-minded,"" Jia Kang said.

It is still too early to say how this divergence would evolve in the future, but the price fluctuations conform to the rule of market, so there is no need for the government to overreact, Jia added.

To get China's real estate sector back on a healthy track, Jia suggested the authorities first increase supply of low-income housing and accelerate property tax legislation.

The making and enforcement of the property tax law, which is being piloted in Shanghai and Chongqing, is widely believed to be helpful to rein in housing market speculations.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/821233391237440/?type=3,2014-04-26 03:41:23,4,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0

Pizza Hut, a subsidiary of the world's largest restaurant company YUM! Brand, Inc., released its new breakfast menu in China on Tuesday. The American chain has been offering breakfast meals since 2012. Three-hundred branches will serve breakfast this year.

A China Cuisine Association report in 2010 on the country's breakfast market showed it was worth 167.39 billion yuan (26.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 2008 and 187.6 billion yuan in 2009. It was expected to grow over 10 percent annually since then, according to the report.

Known as the most important meal of the day, KFC, Starbucks and other western chains have rolled out breakfast menus to attract Chinese customers, offering cakes, burgers and coffee, among other delights.

Compared with traditional Chinese breakfast like steamed stuffed buns and soybean milk, food served in western restaurants is more expensive,ranging from about 15 to 50 yuan.

But white collar workers who want safe and good quality food are opting for western restaurants. A white collar worker surnamed Wang in Shanghai said western restaurants offered a nicer dining environment, and somewhere where she could hold business meetings.

The Chinese catering sector grew only 9 percent year on year in 2013 under the government's frugality campaign, the lowest level in 21 years, said a China Cuisine Association report.

With the rising cost of raw materials, some Chinese enterprises are running unprofitable operations or have closed.

Chinese fast food and casual dining restaurants, which have developed relatively slowly and lagged behind western chains, are losing breakfast trade, said Jin Peihua, deputy secretary of the Shanghai Restaurants Cuisine Association.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party and the Hamas movement on Wednesday announced a reconciliation agreement, declaring an end to their internal split.
   
""The Palestinian internal division has gone once and forever,"" Prime Minister of Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip, Ismail Haniya, told reporters in a joint press conference with Abbas' representatives in Gaza City.
   
Under the agreement, the sides would start discussions to form a unity government within five weeks.
   
The new deal is the outcome of two days of intensive discussions between Hamas officials and a prominent delegation representing the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
   
The new understandings would end a Palestinian political rift that started when Hamas took over Gaza in June 2007 after routing the forces loyal to Abbas who now rules the West Bank.
   
Haniya said that legislative, presidential and the PLO's National Council elections would be held simultaneously and that Abbas would set the date for holding the polls at least six months after formation of a unity government.
   
The Hamas prime minister said the new deal mainly focuses on implementing previous reconciliation agreements signed in Egypt in 2011 and Qatar in 2012.
   
On the PLO, Haniya said a committee to reactivate and develop the Palestinian organization will convene within five weeks to discuss possible ways to reshape the Palestinian umbrella group.
   
Meanwhile, other minor committees for social reconciliation and public freedoms will convene and start functioning as was agreed in the Cairo deal of 2011.
   
The Palestinian Legislative Council will also be reactivated in accordance with previous agreements, Haniya added.

338109312883186_819227738104672,"Feature: Mainland mother of suicide son extends love in Taiwan 

In a tree cemetery east of Taipei, Liu Shan stooped beside a cedar to whisper to her son buried beneath, telling him of the arrival of friends from his hometown on the Chinese mainland.

No epitaph was seen at the burial site of Liu Tengyang, who took his life last year at Taiwan's Fu Jen Catholic University, the first suicide case involving a mainland student in a Taiwan college.

One year after the tragedy exposed the mental plight of the island's newly arrived mainland students, Liu traveled to Taiwan on another motherly mission: to take care of other mainland students in the absence of their parents.

""My son's death would be made worthless if I chose to lie in the grips of sorrow,"" the single mother said. ""I've lost my son, but I was given a new life goal: to love and care about other students like him.""

MAKING THE CRY HEARD
There are thousands of mainland students currently studying in Taiwan's universities, which began recruiting them in 2011, partly in a drive to fill the vacancies left by a shrinking domestic student pool.

Liu said many of these young students suffer social isolation and a lack of care as they adapt to a different society and associate with their Taiwanese peers, who often have clashing thoughts and values.

""There are students who spend most of their time playing games in the dorm or confined to the small circle of mainland students at the same university,"" Liu said.

Such isolation may worsen psychological problems, as demonstrated in the case of Liu Tengyang. The 19-year-old suffered depression before hanging himself in the dormitory on March 18, 2013. The mother suspects the cause was him being excluded by other local students after a failed romance with a Taiwanese girl.

Liu noted Taiwan's lack of protection for mainland students. Offices for mainland students lack personnel and student associations are underfunded. Mainland students are denied access to public health insurance that covers Hong Kong, Macao and other non-local students. In times of emergencies, mainland parents often face red tape in visiting their children.

""Even a minor disease or injury could be devastating to our study. One of my fellow students faced hefty medical bills after breaking a leg, and her parents were forbidden to stay long to take care of her,"" said Xie Jintian, an exchange student from Fujian Province.

Liu decided to make use of her role as a victim's mother and speak out for other mainland students.

""Taiwanese universities recruited mainland students to fill vacancies, but what have they done for these children? Could they do more? Could they treat them the same way as the Taiwanese students?"" Liu said.

In recent years, Taiwan has drawn criticism for its policies on mainland students, including forbidding them from receiving scholarships, doing part-time work or seeking local employment after graduation. Some believe this discrimination is behind the cooling enrollment of mainland students.

Taiwan planned to enroll 3,805 students from the mainland in 2013, but official statistics showed only 1,822 actually came and registered.

ACTING MOM
In February, Liu left her job in Fuzhou City to attend psychology and media courses at Fu Jen University.

The former host of call-in advice radio programs now devotes much of her time to consulting with mainland students, sometimes rushing to the care of sick students in lieu of their parents.

She arranges weekly dinner parties at her small rental apartment and cooks for a few mainland students.

""It's mostly simple home-cooked food. What matters is the family atmosphere for everyone to talk out their minds,"" Liu said.

Liu has a bigger ambition. She wants to establish a ""mama's league"" for similar parties, an idea that has already attracted a couple of Taiwanese mothers who are willing to cook for the mainland students.

Liu said she no longer feels sad, as she is loved by the students. Once she left her cellphone in the apartment while going shopping. Hearing the rings from inside the door but getting no response from knocking, a student became so panicked for her safety that she even made attempts to break into the room.

""Even biological children could do no more than that,"" Liu said. ""My love was repaid -- the children love me.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/819227738104672/?type=3,2014-04-22 22:59:12,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

Garcia Marquez passed away Thursday in his home in Mexico City at the age of 87. He checked into a hospital on April 3 due to ""dehydration and bronchial and urinary tract infections.""

""Although I had some mental preparation, I was still shocked,"" said Fan Ye, a Chinese translator of ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" on China's Twitter-like microblogging service Sina Weibo.

Fan, a teacher at Peking University with a doctorate degree in Spanish literature, translated the masterpiece into Chinese in 2011.

Fan said early Friday that he is in Colombia and that a few hours ago he was staying at the square where Garcia Marquez slept for one night during college. The Chinese translator said he plans to visit his hometown next week.

""The death of Garcia Marquez is a pity, but such a great writer will never leave us,"" said Sun Ganlu, a Chinese writer and deputy chairman of Shanghai Writers' Association.

Sun said he preferred his works such as ""No One Writes to the Colonel,"" ""Autumn of the Patriarch"" and ""Love in the Time of Cholera,"" which he read in the 1980s and 1990s.

""His works deserve re-reading and he will not be forgotten by people as time goes on,"" said Sun. ""I shall read Garcia Marquez again, as the best way to remember a writer is to re-read his works.""

Chinese literature is so familiar with Garcia Marquez that he does not seem like a foreign writer, said Zhou Limin, a literary critic in Shanghai.

338109312883186_815840708443375,"Ship worker Liu Jun has mixed feelings toward the ocean. It offers mystery, but also engulfs lives.

While search efforts are continuing for the Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 with 239 people on board that was believed to have ended in the Indian Ocean more than a month ago, a passenger ship carrying 475 people capsized in waters off the southwest coast of the Republic of Korea (ROK) on Wednesday.

""Human beings are so tiny and powerless,"" said Liu, chief engineer of China's scientific expedition vessel ""Xiangyanghong 09"". ""May the deceased rest in peace, and the alive pull together and carry on.""

At least nine people have died and 287 others are still missing after ""Sewol"" capsized and sank off Jindo Island, near the southwestern tip of the Korean Peninsula.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Thursday at a regular press briefing that China was saddened by the accident, adding that Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday expressed his sympathy to his ROK counterpart Yun Byung-se and promised to provide help for search and rescue efforts whenever needed.

According to the ROK coast guard department, a Chinese vehicle was on board and two Chinese nationals were possibly on the ship and are believed to be missing, Hua said.

The accident has concerned not only the government, but also the Chinese public.

Li Shun, a resident in Jinan, capital of Shandong Province, said he was deeply moved when a news report said a missing student onboard had sent a text message to his mother, which read, ""Mom, in case I never have a chance to say this, I love you.""

""The mother must be devastated. I sincerely hope the missing child is safe and sound,"" he said.

Shandong is the nearest Chinese province from the ROK. Thousands of Korean enterprises are located in its coastal city of Qingdao. 

""We don't know what to say. Just as you (Chinese) are concerned about the whereabouts of MH370 with Chinese people onboard, we are also very worried about our compatriots,"" said a Korean company manager, who asked not to be named.

On the Internet, netizens lit virtual kindles to pray for the missing victims, most of whom were high school students.

Maritime authorities in Shandong on Thursday morning held a video conference, ordering relevant departments to learn a lesson from the accident and ensure the safety of passenger shipping services.

Yuan Zongxiang, chief of Shandong Maritime Safety Administration, said with the Labor Day holiday approaching, the province, with an annual shipping capacity of 30 million passengers, will soon enter its busiest period of the year.

To make full preparations, the administration has started a three-week passenger ship safety inspection campaign. ""It is always necessary to learn lessons,"" he said.

Counterfeited duck blood? Sadly, this is not a joke.

The duck blood sold by a family-run workshop in east China was in fact chicken blood made with banned additives.

Food safety is raising eyebrows among the Chinese public once again after the exposure this week by the People's Daily,the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China.

The owners of the mom and pop store in Huai'an City, Jiangsu Province, were found to have added dyeing and printing auxiliaries to the duck blood they sell to make it appear more appealing, the newspaper said on its official Weibo account, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

The couple who own the shop bought chicken blood instead of duck blood at extremely cheap prices, added inedible dyeing and printing agents to make the blood solid, before selling the products to local markets.

Duck blood is a delicacy in China. The small shop made about 1,000 kg of such ""duck blood,"" according to the People's Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China.

The post, which fueled much public unease, has been forwarded more than 5,000 times as of Thursday morning. In a display of their anger, Chinese netizens wrote a flurry of scathing comments about loose government supervision and a dearth of conscience among food manufacturers.

""If people's hearts have become fake, what genuine food can we expect in the market anyway?"" wrote a Weibo user with the screen name ""Danzengpingcuodedan,"" in despair of food quality in China.

Another netizen screen-named ""Kuailelaoxiaolin"" said that authorities should not shirk their responsibilities in the face of such scandals.

China's food safety has been draped in doubts after a slew of high-profile food scandals shook the confidence of consumers, particularly the one in 2008 when melamine-tainted baby formula caused the deaths of at least six infants and made 300,000 ill.

To address widespread concern, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in March that the government will strictly enforce food laws and regulations, pledging the most stringent supervision and toughest punishment for unscrupulous producers and negligent officials.

Meanwhile, China's food watchdogs have issued innumerable policies to try to stamp out below-standard food.

According to draft amendments to the Food Safety Law released in late October, China will triple the fines for severe food safety violations, while people jailed for such crimes will be banned forever from the food industry.

But illegal manufacturers continue to stick their necks out to stealthily make unqualified food and rake in more profits.

Earlier this month, a couple in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were detained by police on suspicion of adding alum, a banned additive, to the salted food they sell.

One of the suspects surnamed Liang said that they jumped on the bandwagon only because ""others were doing it,"" according to local police.

Luo Guoan, a researcher with the sociology department of the Guangxi Academy of Social Sciences, attributed these food scandals to factors including loose supervision, improper management, imperfect laws and regulations, and manufacturers' eroding credibility.

""There is an urgent need to overhaul the whole food industry,"" Luo said.

One of the major loopholes in the supervision chain is a lack of coordination, he said, pointing out that management of the industry involves many departments, resulting in poor efficiency.

According to Luo, the government needs to ramp up people's awareness of food safety to help crack unqualified edibles in the market.

The researcher said that China should rectify the problem by improving the Food Safety Law, including extending the range of supervision and meting out stiffer penalties to those who violate the law.

""A credibility system should be put in place to regulate the behavior of food makers,"" he added.

338109312883186_815297855164327,"The agonizing search for the vanished Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 and its equally confounding black box is now reaching into seemingly inaccessible depths, with the best technologies reaching their limit this week.

With the Southern Ocean throwing even more challenges in the now desperate race against hope, authorities have begun to acknowledge that the black box has reached its use by date and new, desperate measures are now in place.

By mid-week, far off the coast of Western Australia, the latest roll of the dice for an international operation spanning more than 20 countries that have thrown everything in the search for the fateful Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 witnessed the ""Bluefin-21"" autonomous vehicle slide into the ocean.

At about the same time, experts around the world announced that in all likelihood, the final breaths of the Boeing's black box were being taken somewhere at the bottom of an ocean dotted with underwater volcanic activity and perilous topside conditions.

Several days later and it appears that the submersible bluefin may have already pushed beyond its own limits.

Problems lingered over both days of operation, with the bluefin reaching its maximum operating depth of 4.5 kms and authorities declaring ""no objects of interest"" from its first, brief 7 hour search.

Authorities have little choice but to engage in a visual search in the area 2,087 km north west of Perth, that assumes the black box and any debris is languishing in depths beyond our best technology, in relentless dark and a quagmire of sediment.

Much debate has surrounded the shelf-life of the black box, what Australian aviation expert John Faulkner calls an Australian invention. The black box recorder beacon batteries last a minimum of 30 days.

Flight MH370 vanished over the South China Sea some 40 days, and for many, a lifetime ago.

That leaves technology referred to as ""side-scan"" type sonars, in-built on the bluefin autonomous vehicle, in search now for the wreckage of the plane itself.

Although not as the name implies, the actual black boxes are not necessarily black, but simply too small to find.

Faulkner said, ""The first black boxes were initially produced in the UK with acknowledgment of its Australian origins but these acknowledgments soon disappeared.... In 1965, cockpit voice recorders were mandated in all commercial aircraft built in the US and the western world followed.""

Faulkner, a Senior Visiting Fellow at UNSW, has been at the heart of Australian aviation and his insights into the challenges facing MH370 searchers have provided some light - and sobriety - in an emotion charged month that has seen the largest maritime search in history launched off the coast of Perth.

Robin Robertson, a Senior Lecturer at ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy) said that to locate underwater objects in an ocean, such as the location beacon ""pingers"" attached to the black boxes of MH370, sonars will now be the best ""shot in the dark"".

""If and when the search underwater resumes, there are a number of challenges. Since light only penetrates to about 200m deep even in the clearest water, light is not so useful for searching in the ocean.""

Robertson said multi-beam and side-scan sonars determine the depth of the ocean and the thickness of different types of sediment, such as mud or sand.

""But the depth of the ocean is not well known. We know the Moon and Mars better than we know the ocean floor.""

Search coordination from the ADV Ocean Shield has limits in an area almost totally unmapped.

And that vast ocean has turned out to be deeper than expected.

According to Robertson, ""They discontinued using the autonomous vehicle, since it needs to be within 30m of the ocean bottom to work properly  and that now appears to be beyond its depth range.""

At such depths, pressure becomes a factor, and technology is yet to be created that can endure long-time operation.

Pressure increases by about 1 atmosphere of pressure for every 10m descent (one atmosphere is about 1 kg per square centimeter or 14.7 lb per square inch). At 4,500 meters there would be 450 more atmospheres of pressure. Equivalent to about 465 kg of pressure per square centimeter, according to Robertson's calculations.

It's estimated the search area as roughly 75,000 square kilometers, larger than the nation of Belgium. 

Frustration and anxiety have marked an extraordinary international effort that has spanned across the Asia-Pacific over 40 days.

Even last month, putting some perspective on the geographical challenges, the Vice Chief of the Australian Defense Force (ADF), Air Marshal Mark Binskin told reporters, ""We are not searching for a needle in a haystack.""

""We are trying to define where the haystack is,"" he said.

338109312883186_814814288546017,"China's economic growth slowed to 7.4 percent in the first quarter. The growth outpaced market estimates in the first quarter of 2014, but economists cautioned that downward pressure remains, and targeted measures are needed to ensure growth falls within a proper range.
      
Market estimates had put first-quarter growth at 7.3 percent.
   
The figures suggest growth in the world's second-largest economy in early 2014 was stable and that the economy was generally in good health, as Chinese authorities promoted reforms, innovation, restructuring and improvement of people's well-being, according to the NBS.
   
However, the growth was slow compared to the 7.7-percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 and marked the lowest quarterly growth level since the third quarter of 2012. The figure still outperformed the 6.6-percent growth in the first quarter of 2009, when the global financial crisis wreaked havoc.
   
Economists said the weaker growth suggested heavier downward pressure on the economy, but that the growth rate was still within a reasonable range.
   
""Though slower, I don't think this level of growth is unbearable,"" said Wang Jun, a senior researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges.
   
The economic slowdown came with slower investment and industrial output. Other data jointly released with the GDP figures on Wednesday showed industrial output growth slowed to 8.7 percent in the first quarter.
   
During the same period, fixed asset investment growth gained 17.6 percent the slowest pace since 2002.

These figures, alongside a one-percent drop in the nation's exports and imports in the first quarter and slower power consumption growth, made some economists concerned that a slowdown may extend to next quarter. They wondered how the government would respond to secure stable growth that ensures employment.
   
Rather than a heavy short-term dose of stimulus, the government prefers ""mini stimulus"" programs with an eye toward medium and long-term development, some of which have already been announced by the Chinese government since March. These include a new urbanization plan and investment projects in public service sectors.
   
Wang pointed to measures taken by authorities targeting tax reductions and simplification of administrative procedures, as well as their plans to step up railway investment and renovation of shanty towns.
   
""The economic momentum will increase from the second quarter and there's no need to worry the economy will slide out of control,"" he said.
   
Niu Li, an economist at the State Information Center, said that the government is poised to take fine-tuning measures and deepen reforms that are conducive to growth and market confidence, such as reducing taxes and financing costs of companies.
   
China has set this year's economic growth target at about 7.5 percent, but the government is giving the target less emphasis. Premier Li said that as long as employment is sufficient and there are no major fluctuations, actual GDP growth will be considered to be within the proper range, even if slightly higher or lower than the target.
   
The job market holds tight thanks to the resilience of the service sector.
Statistics showed that urban employment continued to increase, individual income, corporate profits and fiscal revenue registered steady growth, and consumer prices remained stable.
   
NBS data also showed a total of 2.88 million new jobs were filled by migrant workers in the first quarter, up 1.7 percent year on year.
   
Chang Jian, chief economist at Barclays, predicted a recovery of the Chinese economy in the second quarter.
   
""March's new loans and total financing support the view that financing channels remain open to stabilize growth as demand recovers,"" Chang said.
   
Data showed China's new yuan-denominated lending came in better than expected, totaling 1.05 trillion yuan in March, up from 644.5 billion yuan in February. First-quarter new yuan loans totaled 3.01 trillion yuan, up 259.2 billion yuan year on year.
   
The economic slowdown also came amid mild inflation in the first quarter, with the consumer price index, the main gauge of inflation, rising 2.3 percent.
   
Chang forecast benign inflation to continue in the coming months, which leaves room for the central bank in tooling reserve requirement ratio cuts and even interest rate cuts if growth is disappointing in the second quarter.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/814814288546017/?type=3,2014-04-16 04:46:12,5,4,1,5,0,0,0,0,0

The animal welfare group made the announcement jointly with the Nanning-based Flower World Bear Farm in Beijing on Tuesday.

Bear farms profit from taking bile from live bears and selling it to drug stores. The practice, which inflicts pain and damages the health of bears, has drawn criticism from animal rights activists and the public.

Under the Animals Asia project, the organization will invest 5 million U.S. dollars to send 28 sick bears raised in the farm to Animals Asia's bear rescue center in southwest China's Sichuan Province for treatment. Over the next three years it will also transform the Flower World Bear Farm, where 130 bears live, into its second rescue center in China.

""We are providing a sustainable model that shows how bile farms can be converted to sanctuaries,"" said Jill Robinson, founder and CEO of Animals Asia.

Bear bile is held in traditional Chinese medicine theory as a cure for ailments such as eye and liver problems. But doctors believe there are at least 50 herbs that can be used as a substitute in herbal pharmaceutical products.

Eight Chinese pharmacy chains announced last year that they have stopped selling bear bile products, as they joined Animals Asia's campaign to end bear farming. The pharmacy chains have 151 drugstores in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan.

Yan Shaohong, general manager of the Flower World Bear Farm in Nanning, regional capital of Guangxi, said the company chose to cooperate with Animals Asia because the executive board considered that the bear farming business had become increasingly unacceptable to the public.

There are an estimated 10,000 bears raised in pens for their bile. According to Animals Asia, the bears are tortured for bile extraction while living in cages with damp floors.

Animals Asia, founded in 1998, is devoted to ending the ""barbaric practice of bear bile farming."" According to its figure, it has rescued 285 black bears from Chinese bear farms.

DKU, in the city of Kunshan, was jointly created by U.S.-based Duke University and Wuhan University in Hubei Province. The Ministry of Education formally approved its establishment last September.

""We plan to enroll the first cohort of 100 students, including 50 Chinese, offering master's degree programs in global health, medical physics and management studies. Graduates will be granted degrees from Duke University,"" said Liu Jingnan, chancellor of DKU.

In addition to degree academic programs, the university will provide non-degree courses for undergraduate students. Students who successfully complete the program will receive Duke University course credit that can be transferred to other degree-granting institutions.

According to Liu, currently about 20 Chinese universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University and Fudan University, have signed agreements with DKU to select excellent undergraduates to attend the non-degree program. Some of them have already received certificates of admission.

Liu said Chinese students will need to pay between 240,000 yuan (about 39,000 U.S. dollars) and 300,000 yuan for a graduate degree from DKU. Although the cost is comparatively cheaper than studying overseas, it is still big money for most Chinese families.

""But the university will offer scholarships and subsidies for students. Even those from poor families can enjoy the world-class educational resources here,"" Liu said.

The campus will cover an area of about 1,200 mu (80 hectares) and accommodate up to 7,000 students. The three-phase project is expected to be completed by 2024 with an investment of nearly five billion yuan.

A poor Chinese farmer who has struggled to find shoes for his massive feet is being flooded with offers of footwear after the local government launched a campaign to ease his plight.

Huduyum Berdi, of Hotan Prefecture in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has feet measuring 33 cm long, meaning he needs a European size-56 shoe.

""Since I was 18, I have been unable to buy suitable shoes,"" said the 41-year-old. In the past 20-odd years, he has only found one pair of wearable leather shoes, which are now only trotted out for special occasions.

For the rest of the time, he wears cheap plastic slippers when doing farm work and has to stay at home barefoot on the coldest days of the year.

""When other villagers go to towns and cities for work in the slack season, I am trapped at home because I do not have shoes,"" said Huduyum Berdi, who is 185 cm tall.

As a father of three children, he has to fork out about 200 yuan (nearly 32 U.S. dollars) a week for them to go to school. His assets include 0.2 hectares of cropland, 50 date trees, 10 sheep and five geese. A pair of slippers costing five yuan is a luxury for this rural family.

Local officials first noticed Huduyum Berdi's troubles in late March. ""On a very cold day in Hotan, we found him wearing only a pair of scruffy slippers on his cropland,"" said official Yang Guoqiang.

Yang was among 200,000 Xinjiang civil servants dispatched to rural areas in March under an initiative to improve the livelihood of residents there.

He and his colleagues scoured shopping malls in Hotan and regional capital Urumqi for size 56 shoes, but the largest they could find was a size 50.

An idea struck them. Using the official WeChat account of the local government's poverty-busting campaign, they posted a call for help in Huduyum Berdi's case. Since the original post in early April, strangers from home and abroad have replied with offers of assistance.

""We did not expect the post to attract so much attention. We have been bombarded with phone calls,"" said Wang Lili, an editor of the WeChat account.

Dai Junshi, owner of a shoe factory in Chongqing Municipality is among those who have stepped in.

He contacted the local officials and said he would like to make shoes for Huduyum Berdi for the rest of his life. ""China is one of the world's most important shoe manufacturers. How can a Chinese fail to find suitable shoes?"" he asked.

Staff from the marketing department of sportswear manufacturer Li Ning have also been busy calling their suppliers. It has form in shodding high-profile big-foots, having made size-55 trainers for U.S. basketball star Shaquille O'Neal.

Internet user surnamed ""Fangfang"" said her grandma can make cloth shoes and is happy to stretch out her fabric and make two pairs for the needy farmer.

""I am so sorry to trouble these kind-hearted people, but I hope the price of the shoe is not more than 100 yuan,"" Huduyum Berdi said.

338109312883186_813742461986533,"Insight: Game of interests in China's regional integration 

Since Chinese President Xi Jinping called for integration of regions around Beijing in February, the market response has been quick: property prices in neighboring cities have kept rising, as have related stocks.

But concrete moves on the official level are still in slow motion.

In a brief statement on its website, China's National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planner, announced on Wednesday that it is drawing up a plan for the coordinated development of a Beijing-centered ""economic circle,"" but did not say when it will come out.

The idea of integrated development among Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei Province is not new. The central government first proposed plans to coordinate development in the regions in 2004.

Since then, however, there has been little solid progress except for the building of a few transport networks that connect the regions, spawning the creation of ""sleeping city"" commuter towns around Beijing.

Beneath the unintended outcome is the uneven growth and resource distribution among the regions, with Beijing enjoying unmatchable blessings both in the political and economic sphere.

Exactly how the renewed push will deliver will hinge on authorities' resolve and wisdom to balance the game of interests between the regions.

338109312883186_811526795541433,"Insight: Beijing pollutants too much for environment to handle

The amount of pollutants discharged in Beijing last year was much greater than its environment could handle, with PM 2.5 in particular exceeding standards, according to an annual environmental report released on Thursday.
   
Despite its efforts to curb pollution, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau said in the report that the quality of the capital's environment in 2013 remained almost the same as that of the previous year.
   
Based on the six pollutants monitored last year, the air quality of 176 days was classified as ""fine,"" only accounting for 48.2 percent of the whole year, said Zhang Dawei, director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center.

POLLUTION
   
The report shows that Beijing's average PM2.5 (airborne particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter) index stood at 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter in 2013, exceeding the new national standard for fine air by 156 percent.
   
The average index readings of nitrogen dioxide and PM 10 were 56 and 108.1 micrograms per cubic meter, exceeding the national standards by 40 and 54 percent respectively. The daily maximum eight-hour average ozone concentration exceeded the standard by 14.6 percent.
   
Among all the six pollutants monitored in the city, only the index for sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide met the standards last year.
   
Liu Xianshu, director of the environmental monitoring department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said there is a gap between air quality in the southern and northern parts of the city.
   
""The average PM2.5 index monitored in the north was 60.3 micrograms per cubic meter last year, while it stood at 116.3 micrograms per cubic meter in the south, about twice the amount of the north,"" Liu said.
   
According to the report, Beijing failed to address its shortage of water resources and the severe pollution of downstream sections of the capital's rivers.

SOLUTIONS
   
To improve the environment, China must drop a GDP-oriented development model and take its environmental capacities into consideration when making economic development plans, said Zhong Maochu, a professor at Nankai University in Tianjin Municipality.
   
That is particularly true for Beijing right now, as the city streamlines its industrial structure.
   
The municipal commission of development and reform confirmed with Xinhua on Thursday that it has not yet made a list of the ""most energy-consuming and highly polluting"" enterprises to be relocated to neighboring cities.
   
However, it does encourage enterprises to improve their pollution control facilities to ensure they can remain in Beijing, said a commission official who is familiar with the situation.
   
""Beijing has paid a remarkable environmental cost for pollution.Considering Beijing's role in the country, the removal of polluters from the city is inevitable,"" said Niu Fengrui, a researcher with the Institute for Urban and Environmental Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
   
The government, however, should take more measures to encourage enterprises to upgrade their production technologies to reduce pollutant emissions and to lessen energy consumption voluntarily, said Niu.
   
""Financial support for the key enterprises is a good way of doing this,"" said the researcher.
   
Beijing published a guideline in 2007 on the management of polluting enterprises, vowing to close or remove all small plants processing concrete, paper, chemicals, casting products, printing and dyeing products, electroplate products, and plate glass.
   
The city plans to either close or upgrade 300 highly polluting enterprises in 2014, and the number is expected to reach 1,200 by the end of 2016, when annual industrial coal consumption will be reduced by 2 million tonnes annually, the commission added.
   
A set of measures was already rolled out in 2013 to tackle Beijing's environmental problems.
   
In September, the local government unveiled a five-year plan (2013- 2017) to improve air quality through means including slashing coal consumption, promoting clean energy use and reducing production capacities with heavy pollution.
   
That followed a three-year plan (2013-2015) being issued last May to improve Beijing's waste water treatment and promote the construction of water recycling facilities.
   
According to the environmental protection bureau, last year saw 44,000 households in downtown Beijing bid farewell to coal-fired stoves and start to use electrical heaters. 
   
The city also replaced 366,000 high-emission vehicles with new ones and raised environmental standards for enterprises. The construction of highly polluting and energy-intensive facilities was forbidden, and fines for emissions of major pollutants were raised.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/811526795541433/?type=3,2014-04-10 07:00:05,850,5,1,850,0,0,0,0,0

338109312883186_811321578895288,"More Chinese coal mine operators are looking beyond mining, with some returning to their agricultural roots. 

""After selling some of my mines, I started to invest in potato processing,"" said Zhang Bao, a former coal baron, now boss of Huajin Potato Company in Datong City, in north China's Shanxi Province. 

Since 2011, Zhang has invested 130 million yuan (21 million U.S. dollars) in potato starch. His company processes around 140,000 tonnes of potatoes every year.

Zhang is one example of a transformation in Shanxi. Data from the province's statistics bureau show that investors are more interested in farms than coal mines.

In 2013, fixed assets investments in primary industries in Shanxi, represented by agriculture, amounted to 70.5 billion yuan, a 92.6 percent increase year-on-year. This is a three-year high, far surpassing the 13 percent enjoyed by the secondary industries, where mining and manufacturing are included.

The recent economic downturn has caused wobbles among resource-based industries in the province. In 2008, the government started shutting down unqualified coal mines. Also, as coal price continues to drop, investors have gradually withdrawn from the industry, and agriculture is filling the gap.

""Many coal mine owners used to be farmers,"" said Guo Weidong of Shanxi Academy of Social Sciences. ""With the integration of coal resources, many of them are looking to farmland out of risk concerns.""

A series of policies favorable to agriculture have helped the inflow of capital into the sector, guaranteeing agriculture security and improving farmers'income. This has made agriculture investment easier for coal mine operators, and agriculture in Shanxi is developing quickly.

""The coal mine owners have become modern agriculture trailblazers with their capital, technology and marketing skills,"" said Guo.

""In the next step, we plan to make the investment environment more friendly and develop modern agriculture even further,"" said Guo. ""One thing is for sure: more mine owners will come back to the farm, and we can expect more vigorous development.""

Editor's note: Smog has plagued many cities across China. The worst-affected regions, including Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province in the north, have pledged to reduce coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

Encouraging as it sounds, barons returning to farmland is still a small part of the solution.

338109312883186_810975552263224,"Insight: China rising from low-cost manufacturer to innovator

It might be a bad time for Chinese manufacturers as the economic slowdown and restructuring squeeze their profit margins. It could also be good for them too, if they can embrace innovation to move up the value chain.
   
The good old days for China's low-cost manufacturers are gone. They now feel the pinch due to factors including mounting excess capacity, rising labor costs and increasing international competition. 
   
""We found that China's industrial revolution was less technologically innovative compared with Britain and the United States,"" said Nobel Prize Laureate Ronald Harry Coase at the ongoing Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) 2014 Annual Conference. 
   
""This was disturbing and unfortunate, particular since the modern economy has become more and more knowledge-driven,"" said Coase, one of ten delegates who questioned over 40 Chinese entrepreneurs on their innovation willingness and capability at the forum.

MOVING UP THE LADDER
   
For Chinese iPhone fans, they may lament as their smartphone screens are made by overseas manufacturers. But they may feel a little relieved if they know that the super glass walls of some Apple stores are made by a Chinese glass manufacturer.
   
""The market for ordinary glass is getting smaller with increasing competition and decreasing margins. The only way to survive is to move up the value chain through innovation,"" said Dou Qinghe, vice president of AVIC Glass, a specialist glass maker in south China's Hainan Province. 
   
Like Dou, more Chinese entrepreneurs are racing to catch up with international competitors using expertise, talent and financial firepower.
   
""The speed of innovation is much higher than that in the west. Just think about how China looked 30 years ago, now you see first-class technical universities cooperating with Chinese industries to further innovate,"" said Ernst Ulrich von Weizsacker, co-President of the Club of Rome. 
   
According to a report released by the World Intellectual Property Organization in March, China ranked third in total international patent applications to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, with over 20,000 applications, up 15.6 percent year on year.
  
""China is very responsive and receptive to innovative ideas and sectors, such as e-commerce and Internet finance. The embrace for such innovations in turn facilitate further reforms by helping nurture a multi-tier and freer capital market,"" said Gregory D. Gibb, Chairman and CEO of Shanghai Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange Co., Ltd. 
   
""I believe some sectors may even outperform the United States and Europe in three to five years thanks to their innovation-driven growth,"" Gibb added.

FREER, FAIRER MARKET EXPECTED
   
However, Chinese entrepreneurs have mixed feelings about innovation. Some accept the necessity to upgrade themselves through technical and operational reform to gain a steadier foothold, but some complain feeling shackled due to unfavorable conditions.
   
Small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have the loudest complaint. Subsidies to support R&D are unfairly distributed to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and markets in energy, financial services and telecoms are not fully open to private firms. 
   
According to Nobel Prize Laureate Edmund Phelps' observation, one result of the differentiated treatment towards SMEs and SOEs is the unbalanced talent flow.
   
""It's a pity that so many young people graduating from universities are going into jobs they see as more secure in the public sector instead of startups, the most energetic cradle of innovation,"" Phelps said.
   
It takes a segmented and completely competitive market to foster innovation. If the market is not open to fair competition and resources are mainly relocated by government administrative approvals instead of personal competence of each company, then few are willing and capable to invest in new products or services, said Gao Jifan, Chairman & CEO of Trina Solar, Ltd. 
   
The Chinese leadership vowed last year to reduce over one third of 1,700-plus administrative approval items during their stewardship. More than 300 items have been relinquished or delegated to lower governments. The country is gradually opening traditionally monopolistic sectors to all market players and is promoting mixed ownership to combine financial strength with technological advantages. 
   
What the government should do is to invest more in basic research and development to aid enterprises, said Zhang Yaqin, vice president of Microsoft.

STRONGER IPR PROTECTION NEEDED
   
Another major concern is the country's weak intellectual property rights (IPR) protection regime.
   
China is implementing an indigenous innovation strategy, promoting the development of technological innovation in domestic firms, eventually leading to the ownership of their own core IPR.
   
Entrepreneurs, especially from foreign firms and start-ups, worry that registering patents and proprietary information would open the door to theft and competition from lower-cost manufacturers.
   
China may not face talent shortages in its innovation drive, but lack the right environment, or to be more specific, IPR protection to encourage innovation, said Leo Melamed, Chairman Emeritus, Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
   
Efforts are stepping up to shore up IPR protection. China will try to set up a special court for IPR cases, according to the Supreme People's Court's work report for 2014. The practice, which is common in some developed countries, is believed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of dealing with IPR piracy cases.
   
In addition to economic and legal policies, experts argue it is critical to nurture an innovation-friendly culture. 
   
High innovation requires people with the right culture, or the right values. It is critical to encourage skepticism, curiosity and exploration in society, Phelps said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/810975552263224/?type=3,2014-04-09 07:13:27,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel became the first foreigner to visit China's only aircraft carrier Liaoning on Monday. It was a genuine gesture showing China's transparency, and its growing confidence.
   
Carriers have always boasted a symbolic standing in not only military but also a nation's comprehensive strength. The Liaoning was developed based on a Soviet-made warship that was sold to China by Ukraine. It was delivered to the navy in 2012.
   
The commissioning of Liaoning meant China achieved its dream of having an aircraft carrier, as the country had been bullied by western powers due to its lack of a powerful navy. By opening up the Liaoning, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) showed great sincerity to its U.S. counterpart.
   
Little news used to come out of the PLA. However, as Chinese authorities seek a more transparent image, the army has also made efforts in this area.
   
Hagel's tour was only one of many strides China has taken to assure the international community of its good faith in defense, which includes regular publication of national defense white papers, publicity of once classified code designations of the 18 army groups, and the appointment of spokespersons.
   
From another point of view, there is nothing to hide from the world's only superpower. Liaoning is a medium-sized conventionally powered aircraft carrier, which lags far behind the larger, more advanced and nuclear-powered U.S. Nimitz Class carriers, let alone the latest Gerald Ford Class.
   
The confidence of China comes not from the buildup of its arsenal, but from the understanding of its role as a developing country and its peaceful development path, which begs a defense policy with a defensive nature.
   
But China's grace should not be taken for granted and its concerns should be addressed.
   
Hagel on Tuesday pointed to cyber security as an example of an area where the U.S. would like China to be more transparent. That is in fact where the U.S. owes China an explanation, as the U.S. had been reported to have penetrated the cyber networks of Chinese government assets and private telecommunications equipment maker Huawei.
   
Hagel is also expected to talk about issues that are of great importance to China, such as the East China Sea and the South China Sea, where the country's core interests in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity seems, to put modestly, insufficiently appreciated by the United States.
   
Just prior to his China visit, Hagel announced that the U.S. would forward-deploy two additional Aegis ballistic missile defense ships to Japan, whose government infringed on China's territories that have led to an all-time low in bilateral ties.

Ernst Ulrich von Weizsacker, co-chair of the International Resource Panel, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview that air pollution was also a headache for Germany in the 1960s.

After that, strict air quality rules were adopted in many cities, forcing coal power plants, iron manufacturers and other industries to reduce polluting emissions.

""I believe the dependence on coal in China is roughly the same as it was in Germany in the 1960s. In Germany, it took maybe 20 years [to adjust from a model that was over-reliant on coal], and this is also doable for China,"" Weizsacker said.

Meanwhile, he said he was impressed by China's determination to raise energy efficiency and combat air pollution in the next few years.

By 2020, non-fossil-fuel energy will account for 15 percent of China's total primary energy consumption, and CO2 emission per unit of GDP will drop by 40 to 45 percent from the level of 2005, the government has promised.

Liu was among over 20 visitors who visited the city's funeral home for its first-ever open day, a week prior before Tomb-Sweeping Day this Saturday, an occasion for Chinese people to pay their respects to their ancestors.

In January, the provincial civil affairs department ordered more than 20 funeral parlors in different cities of Guangdong to allow citizens a one-day tour of their forbidden zones before the festival.

The move made the headlines since death largely remains a taboo in China, with funeral homes regarded as mysterious and inauspicious.

The village which fell into decline with the closure of the mine has risen again as a kitty paradise. Over 120 feral cats dwell in the old community beside the station. In packs or individually, the furry residents are seen roaming or relaxing everywhere in the hilly neighborhood, usually followed by a bedazzled ailurophile, camera in hand.

After the mine, which was the lifeblood of the village, ceased production in the 1990s, most young people left to seek jobs in the cities, leaving behind only a few elders, accompanied by a colony of unwanted cats. A number of cat lovers arrived in 2008 and the desolate hamlet became ""Cat Village"".

The locals believe their kind treatment of the feral felines has brought them good luck and, indeed, visitors flood into the village now in search of the cute kitties which drive the local economy. 

This is not a matter of the occasional timid stray sneaking up beside you, but legions of them, constituting the majority of the village population.

Visitors are not just amazed by their numbers. Here, you see cats leaping onto dining tables demanding food, lounging on the lap of any tourist who dares to stop and sit for a while, and accosting anyone who pauses on a roadside bench or stoops to tie a shoelace. In cold weather, a warm lap is often taken over by two or three uninvited temporary residents.

This intimacy is a story of how trans-species love was rewarded. Cat photographer Chien Pei-ling was so grateful for the elders' caring for the kittens, that she launched a campaign in 2009 and called for cat lovers everywhere to help renovate the community into a more inhabitable place (for humans).

The influx of cat lovers was the beginning of the rise of ""Cat Village"". They tidied up the trash, vaccinated the moggies, put up signs saying ""No dogs"" and more importantly, taught locals and visitors how to take better care of cats.

""The local cats used to avoid strangers, but after years of interaction with cat lovers, they began to trust people,"" Chien said. ""Now, when the cats see humans, they think 'food, fondling and a walking stove'.""

THE CAT RISES

By 2010, Houtong was a tourist boomtown, where residents made their living as tour guides or by running snack stalls, cafes and souvenir shops.

Here, everything is cat-related. You can buy cat food to please the furry celebrities and, after a day of happy cat snapping, unstring your purse for a myriad of souvenirs from postcards to cat-shaped pastries.

The blessed cats are now beloved mascots, revered like saints, housed in shrine-like huts and fed on canned fish. A footbridge was built last year to facilitate the passage of cats across the busy rail track.

In 2010, when star cat Blacknose died, even Taiwan's railway authority expressed its condolences. They funded a 1.8 meter statue and presented a conductor's cap as a tribute. The beckoning conductor still stands at the train station, greeting passengers and watching over his home village.

In the eyes of Chien, now head of a Taiwan association for cat lovers, the true wonder of Houtong is not how it has changed the fate of so many cats, but how it has educated even more humans.

""Tourists begin to love cats after playing with Houtong cats. I hope such interactions inspire them to treat all animals kindly and not to abandon their pets,"" she said.

Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi Province will allow 72-hour transit visa exemptions for foreign nationals to make it more accessible to the outside world, local authorities said on Friday.

Foreigners from 51 countries in Europe, America, Oceania and Asia will be able to visit Xi'an, Shaanxi's capital city, and Xianyang City without visas within 72 hours when they are en route to a third country or region via Xi'an Xianyang International Airport (XXIA), according to a statement issued by the provincial government.

Xi'an is the eighth city in China to embrace the policy, joining Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Dalian and Shenyang.

The policy, expected to be implemented in the next two or three months, will help ramp up Shaanxi's opening-up levels, as it provides more convenience for visting foreign nationals, according to the government.

Shaanxi boasts abundant tourism resources, making it a popular choice among inbound and outbound visitors. In 2013, the province received 285 million tourists, 797,000 of whom made their trips via XXIA.

The exhibition, which opened in November 2013, has been so successful that the Madrid Local Authority has decided to extend it to April 20, meaning it will be another attraction open during the forthcoming Easter holidays.

Located in the Fernan Gomez Theater in the heart of Madrid, the Terracotta Army exhibition coincides with the 40th anniversary of one of the most important archeological discoveries of all time: that of over 8,000 terracotta soldiers, along with 130 chariots and almost 700 horses, depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, namely the first Emperor of China's Qin dynasty more than 2,200 years ago.

Although none of the original warriors is on display in Madrid, visitors can see full scale replicas of 150 figures, including 90 warriors, horses and equipment, discovered in Pit One of the excavations.

They are surrounded by a diorama aimed at giving the impression of how these pieces appear in their original setting, along with another 70 reproductions, including government officials, weapons, jewels, tools and art to give a true sense of life in ancient China.

Xiangzhou 1 is ""sea skimmer"" or ground effect vehicle (GEV). Equipped with wings and a propeller similar to those of planes, at a stable speed around 160 km per hour (85 knots), the 12 meter, 2.5 tonne vessel ""flew"" about two meters above the level of the sea in tests off Sanya.

Made by a subsidiary of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, China's foremost shipbuilder, and licensed by the China Classification Society, Xiangzhou 1 can fly up to 50 meters above the water at a maximum speed of 210 km per hour. With a range of 400 kilometers, it is the fastest GEV in China.

Xiangzhou 1 is China's first GEV for commercial use, but the country has manufactured more than 10 such ships since 1967, mainly for inland waterways. GEVs are faster than boats and cheaper than actual flight. Container ships typically proceed at about 30 km per hour, warships about double that.

The ""ground effect"" is extra lift generated by airfoils moving close to a solid surface and allows the ship to literally sail above the water or any other fixed surface.

Apart from speed, GEVs are virtually immune to waves and are highly maneuverable, making them ideal for multiple purposes including rescue work, transportation and entertainment.

A renowned Buddhist temple in east China's Zhejiang Province has set up an anti-terrorist and anti-riot squad to cope with potential emergencies as the peak travel season approaches.

The squad at the 1,700-year-old Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang, is made up of 20 monks aged between 20 and 40 and over 20 security guards, Master Jueheng said on Thursday.

It is the first such initiative for Chinese temples. The squad's members are equipped with shields, pepper spray and batons.

""The squad members practice Buddhism in the day and take part in training exercises at night,"" said Jueheng.

338109312883186_807845792576200,"Smartphones, laptops dominate Chinese ""screen time"": survey 

Chinese smartphone owners spend nearly eight hours looking at electronic screens each day, the third longest in the world, with smartphones and laptops dominating their ""screen time,"" according to survey results released on Wednesday.

The survey, conducted by market research company Millward Brown, which is part of British advertising giant WPP, polled more than 12,000 smartphone owners in 26 countries and regions around the world.

The survey found that Chinese smartphone owners are increasingly using mobile phones and laptops both in conjunction with and in replacement of TVs.

On average, a Chinese smartphone owner spends 479 minutes looking at the screens of TVs, laptops, smartphones and tablets -- 62 minutes more than global average.

Smartphones (170 minutes per day) and laptops (161 minutes per day) dominate their ""screen time,"" while TV holds their attention for only 89 minutes per day -- one of the shortest among all countries surveyed.

Chinese smartphone owners' time spent in front of TV screens during traditional prime time is also significantly shorter than the global average.

Though 29 percent of respondents watched TV from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., the same as the global average, only 22 percent were still watching it from 9 p.m. till midnight, 10 percentage points lower than the global average, it said.

The survey found that even when they're in front of a TV, their attention is shared across different screens.

When asked about their reasons for using a second device, 91 percent of respondents said it was to access information unrelated to TV content while watching TV, including to ""fill time during ad breaks"" (44 percent), ""keep up with friends on social media"" (42 percent) and ""TV not interesting enough"" (35 percent). The proportion of people claiming TV content is boring is 7 percentage points higher than the average around the world.

Chinese audiences have increasingly formed a multiscreen lifestyle -- they not only use other devices when watching TV, some of them have even started to shift away from TV to watch television content on mobile phones and tablets, said Chris Maier, Millward Brown's Greater China director for media and digital solutions.

Consumers are utilizing multiple screens for the purpose of ""meshing,"" using different devices to seek information about the same topic, like to further research TV programming content, and ""stacking,"" using different devices to seek content about different topics, according to Maier.

""We see this latter trend as growing evidence that strong programming content online is taking consumers away from TV and more to online TV. Finally, the adage that 'content is king' holds true and, consequently, holistic media shifting is taking place,"" he said.

However, people do still respond in a positive way to interesting TV content, Maier pointed out, citing the fact that 25 percent of respondents said they will use a second device to ""learn more information about what's on TV"" while 18 percent said they will ""discuss what I'm watching via social media.""

""This shows that TV audiences' multiscreen behavior is dynamic: they either seek entertainment elsewhere, away from TV content, or pour more attention into the interesting shows,"" he added.

These new findings should encourage marketers to design and execute more integrated marketing campaigns across multiple screens.

""Since Chinese people are spending so much time across screens, marketers have to make sure their message is consistent regardless of channels,"" according to Maier.

338109312883186_807699272590852,"Pu Tsering, a good-natured primary school teacher, is very stubborn when it comes to which language his students have to speak.

""We should speak standard Tibetan,"" the 37-year-old language teacher often tells his students at a boarding school in Yushu, a Tibetan autonomous prefecture in northwest China's Qinghai Province.

""As a Tibetan teacher, I'm responsible for preserving our mother tongue,"" Pu Tsering said through an interpreter in an interview with Xinhua.

He insists on saying ""maqepu chang"" when all his friends from childhood say ""Yellow River Beer"" in Mandarin Chinese at bars and cafeterias in town, hoping to keep his own Tibetan pure and set an example for his students.

""Many new words -- such as iPhone, iPad and Twitter -- do not exist in Tibetan,"" said Yeshi Soiba, a native of Yushu who graduated from the University of Kent in England. ""It's very easy to use the English words, so no one has bothered to make up equivalents in Tibetan.""

Yeshi Soiba is a program liaison officer with the local government in Yushu. 

He is fluent in Tibetan, and switches freely to Mandarin and English, a skill he acquired at university. ""I majored in environmental protection and community development, and it was extremely difficult for me to find Tibetan -- sometimes even Mandarin -- equivalents of terminologies.""

In fact, the lack of new words has led to concern among Tibetan linguists.

""All languages change with time and the same is true of Tibetan,"" said Genqub Tenzin, a Tibetan-Mandarin translator in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province neighboring Tibet Autonomous Region.

""As the Tibet plateau is no longer isolated from the rest of the world, its language is updated with a rapidly expanding vocabulary of borrowed words,"" he said.

NEW LEXICON

Genqub Tenzin is one of many Tibetan linguists working to preserve the language.

He is head of a government-run Tibetan textbook compilation committee that edits written work for primary and middle schools in Tibet as well as other Tibetan areas in Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu and Yunnan provinces. Translation of borrowed words is an increasingly important job in the committee's editing.

""When we cannot find a Tibetan equivalent, we try to work out new phrases, or paraphrase the idea with existing Tibetan words,"" he said. ""Transliteration is our last choice.""

In one of their latest works, a Tibetan-Chinese-English dictionary of new words and terminologies, Genqub Tenzin and his trilingual team submitted more than 13,000 entries, including new Tibetan coinage for computer, mouse, web users and even microblog.

But first published in 2006, the dictionary has lagged behind the development of technology and the influx of new words. 

""There's a lot more to be done,"" said Genqub Tenzin. ""We have to move faster in updating the Tibetan lexicon. Hopefully, we'll also promote standard Tibetan to replace the different dialects in different parts of Tibet and other Tibetan communities in western China.""

BILINGUAL EDUCATION

Pu Tsering said he understands youngsters' interest in novelty and their eagerness to catch up with modern life and new technology. ""After all, they are living in a world vastly different from the one their parents and grandparents lived.""

When he was a child, Pu Tsering learned to recite long chapters from King Gesar, a classic Tibetan epic. He still remembers vividly the texts from ""King of the horse race"" and ""Saving his wife from hell"".

""Such classic pieces are rarely found in children's textbooks nowadays,"" he said. ""Like elsewhere in China, textbooks are more functionally tailored to pass exams.""

He often tells his students to speak and read Tibetan as much as possible, fearing the younger generation might one day forget their traditional language and culture in their pursuit of modernity.

The Chinese government encourages bilingual education at schools in Tibet and other ethnic regions. In Tibetan areas, most classes are taught in Tibetan, though Mandarin and English classes are also on the curriculum.

Teachers in Tibetan areas are given on-the-job training to help with their bilingual teaching.

""We have trained more than 35,000 primary and middle school teachers in the province since 2004,"" said Dong Haifeng, deputy dean of the ethnic teachers' college of Qinghai Normal University. 

At least half of these teachers received bilingual training, in Tibetan and Mandarin, he said. The college, which also trains undergraduates to become bilingual teachers at Tibetan schools, teaches most freshman and sophomore classes in Tibetan, said Dong.

""Juniors and seniors are taught in Chinese, but tutorials are given, after class and in Tibetan, at the students' individual requests,"" he said.

Upon graduation, the students are required to pass Tibetan as well as Chinese language proficiency tests, he said.

The school has obtained more than 40 sets of Tibetan-Chinese bilingual textbooks covering arts as well as science to ensure students are well-grounded in both languages.

Meanwhile, the Chinese central government and Tibet's regional government have invested more than 1 billion yuan (163 million U.S. dollars) since 2008 to boost technological application of the Tibetan language, including the development of Tibetan-language office software and digital dictionaries. 

Last year, the first Chinese-Tibetan bilingual smartphone went on the market in Lhasa, capital city of Tibet. The phone was jointly developed by the country's technology firm Huawei, China Telecom's Tibetan branch and the University of Tibet. It allows Chinese and Tibetan input and supports many Tibetan-language applications. 

""Tibetan is a unique language, colorful and explicit,"" said Yeshi Soiba, the government employee in Yushu who also speaks Chinese and English. ""It has different names, for example, for calves aged from 1 to 7.To know the language will help you understand the Tibetan culture and people.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/807699272590852/?type=3,2014-04-02 21:21:03,4,1,1,4,0,0,0,0,0

Although spring is the main season for tea harvesting and sales, farmers near West Lake have been feeling a chill this year following China's frugality and anti-corruption campaigns.

Few customers are buying high-end tea, in sharp contrast to previous years, at Longjing Village, a major production base for West Lake Longjing tea.

""Buyers are only offering us between 5,000 yuan (805.5 U.S. dollars) and 5,600 yuan per kilo, one third lower compared with last year,"" said a farmer surnamed Jiang. Prices reached as much as 16,000 yuan per kilo in 2012.

Dubbed ""queen of green tea"", West Lake Longjing is produced in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province, and represents one of the most famous teas in the country, with 370 million drinkers.

However, national campaigns since late 2012 banning officials from accepting gifts or buying extravagant goods with public money have impacted the high-end tea industry.

A villager surnamed Qian said a government bureau in the province used to order 10 kilos of high-end tea every year. ""This year, for the first time, they have canceled their order.""

The Spring Festival and Tomb-sweeping Day, which falls on Saturday this year, are usually peak sales periods for West Lake Longjing tea. Not this year.

Local gift shop owner Du Qiaohong has not sold a single box of high-end Longjing tea since before the Spring Festival in January.

""Few people buy them as gifts now,"" said Du, who plans to close the gift shop.

Tea leaf dealers have also witnessed a slump. Lu Jiangmei, chairwoman of Hangzhou Zhenghao Tea Leaf Co., Ltd., said unlike previous years, when ""major clients"" from across the country ordered 70 percent of their high-end teas, the company has decided to control purchases to prevent excessive inventory.

""If the tea is not sold this year, it will be worthless next year when new tea leaves are harvested,"" she said.

The company is one of the largest dealers of Longjing tea, with 30,000 kilos of tea leaves sold last year. About one sixth of the volume was high-end tea, according to Lu.

To boost sales, she said the company was looking into online trade and selling at lower prices.

Communist Party of China (CPC) leaders introduced an eight-point rule a month after they were elected in November 2012 to fight corruption and bureaucracy. The ongoing campaign requires officials to condense meetings, reduce ceremonies and exercise thrift. Another regulation in January 2013, before the Spring Festival that year, bans officials from giving and accepting gifts, tours and banquets with the use of public cash.

Such rules started affecting high-end tea sales last year, and a series of corruption cases have further deterred officials from violating rules this year, said Yu Bohong, a commentator and observer on social issues.

Zhang Yufu, manager of a tea auction company, said the frugality rules have meant the price of high-end Longjing tea has come down to a reasonable level, which was actually good for the development of the industry.

Zhang said West Lake Longjing tea was auctioned at 360,000 yuan per kilo in 2012, 24,000 yuan higher than the price of gold at the time. Last year the tea was auctioned at between 6,000 and 14,000 yuan per kilo, and is likely to go down further this year.

Qi Guowei, who owns West Lake Longjing brand ""Gong"" said, ""With tea as our national drink, we don't want West Lake Longjing tea to be a privilege for the few. Instead, we hope it's in the tea cups of ordinary people.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/807334042627375/?type=3,2014-04-02 05:41:04,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

Former mining tycoon Liu Han denied the charge of organizing and leading an alleged mafia-style gang during Tuesday's trial.

Trials of 36 members of an alleged mafia-style gang opened on Monday in central China's Hubei Province on charges including intentional homicide.

The ring, allegedly led by former mining tycoon Liu Han and his brother Liu Wei in southwest China's Sichuan Province, is the largest criminal group of its kind to go on trial in China in recent years.

Liu Han was board chairman of the Hanlong Group, the biggest private enterprise in Sichuan. He owned tens of subsidiary companies involved in electricity, energy, finance, mining, real estate and securities.

From 1993, Liu Han, Liu Wei and Sun Xiaodong, who is being dealt with in a separate case, made their money running gambling dens and dealing in construction materials and futures in Sichuan's cities of Guanghan and Chengdu as well as Shanghai and Chongqing, according to a prosecutors' statement released late Monday.

From 1997, when Liu Han and Sun Xiaodong set up the Hanlong Group in Mianyang, the two cooperated with Liu Wei in recruiting a gang of thugs, and the group gradually developed to a relatively stable criminal organization. The organization had ten steady members of a backbone team and another 20 followers. Liu Han, Liu Wei and Sun were the organizers and leaders of the group.

The group boasted a clear division of labor with Liu Han responsible for commanding the group and decision making, Sun implementing Liu's instructions and managing Hanlong's daily operations, and Liu Wei leading the hatchet men or ""bodyguards"".  The group made tremendous financial gains through organized crime and became an economic force to be reckoned with.

They planned and committed murders and assaults; locked up their enemies; took part in extortion, illegal trade and possession of guns; and tyrannized local people, the Xianning procuratorate said.

""Liu's gang took control over various local industries such as mining illegally and had a huge influence, severely damaging economic and social order. Their doings should be viewed as organizing, leading and participating in mafia-style gang,"" prosecutors said, adding Liu's gang had violated the criminal law and evidence for their crimes was ""solid, abundant and clear"".

Prosecutors said these people should be held criminally liable for crimes including organizing and leading the gang, intentional homicide and assault, illegal detention, holding and trading in illegal guns, collusion in bidding, running illegal businesses, racketeering, intentional destruction of property, obstructing officials in their line of duty, organizing gambling, harboring criminals, and loan fraud.

According to the court, the 36 defendants are being simultaneously prosecuted in seven cases to make clear facts and protect the legal interests of the accused. The criminal and civil content of the cases will be dealt with separately to ensure consistency. This trial only concerns the criminal aspects and was attended by 27 prosecutors, 36 defendants and their 50 defending lawyers, 49 of whom met their clients and consulted on all related matters before the trials.

Some defendants had no objection to the charges and others denied them.

Prior to the trials,  prosecutors, defendants and defence lawyers exchanged opinions and reached consensus on some issues concerning the jurisdictions of the cases, withdrawal of parties of interests and the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence.

In an effort to increase engagement with Chinese families of MH370, the Malaysian government will hold a high-level briefing for them that will be telecast live to Beijing, an official said in Kuala Lumpur on Monday.

Malaysia's Acting Transportation Minister Hishamuddin Hussein reiterated the government would ""not give up"" on the possibility of survivors and insisted all attention was being paid to ""reasonable"" requests from families who had their loved ones broad MH370.
   
""The government is due to hold a high-level briefing soon for these families, to update them on the latest developments regarding the search for MH370. The briefing will include international experts who were not available during the briefings in Beijing, including experts from China. It will also be broadcast live to other families in Beijing.""
   
The briefing will provide an opportunity for the families to hear directly from some of these experts. The experts will be able to explain the research, the data and the methodology that has informed the search operation.
   
Hishamuddin continued to emphasize that the Malaysian government had at no point officially mentioned the flight crashed into the South Indian Ocean or there were no survivors.
   
He insisted speculation and misinformation was the main reason for tensions between families and the Malaysian government.
   
The minister downplayed questions from the media on the investigation and refused to release transcripts on the MH370's flight path mapped out by investigators that had already been shown to families during briefings, saying it would be ""unfair"" to the families.
   
However Hishamuddin did assure the media that if investigators give approval more information would be released.
   
He also noted that fallback plans if debris from the flight is not found in the current search area had been discussed with partner countries but refused to divulge details.
   
Malaysian Police chief Khalid Abu Bakar is expected to give an update on internal investigations within the next few days.

We will continue searching, and we will keep investigating, and we will never give up until we find out what happened to MH370.""
   
Hishamuddin pointed out citizens from 13 other countries including Malaysians were also on MH370 and the government is engaging with those families as well. He recalled that during a meeting on Monday with Indonesian Special Envoy and Special Advisor to the Foreign Minister Wiwiek Setyawati Firman and her delegation, no dissatisfaction over Malaysia's handling of the investigation had been expressed.
   
Malaysian Airlines Chief Executive Officer Ahmad Jauhari Yahya stated in response to questions that no indication of a lawsuit by the families had been made so far and the company would deal with such an issue if it happens.
   
Earlier reports noted families dissatisfied with the Malaysian airlines were planning to initiate legal proceedings against the company.

Canada's oldest Chinese print shop in Vancouver's Chinatown closed Friday, ending its 106 years of history.

The owner of the shop, 81-year-old Hilda Lam, said she closed the business because there was not enough market for the high-end printing the company specialized in. She has also planned to retire.

She put the century-old building on the market last year and sold for 1.65 million Canadian dollars (1.5 million U.S. dollars).

The company was started by Lam's ancestor in Vancouver in 1906 and became a Chinatown staple since then, doing printing for Chinese restaurants all across Canada, in both English and Chinese.

Many of the presses the company owned were antiques and attracted interest from boutique printers across North America.

""All the machines are gone, except for that Linotype over there that's broken down,"" Lam said.

She was not sure what the future holds for the building, which was probably built around the 1910s, except saying ""some Asian guy bought the building.""

Visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel decided Friday to lift bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership.

In talks with Merkel in the afternoon, Xi said the coming years will be a crucial period for both China's and Germany's reform and development, and for the two countries to grow and achieve progress together.

China and Germany are not only economic partners but also political partners and 
strategic cooperation partners, Xi said, adding that it is a step of great significance that the two sides establish a comprehensive strategic partnership and start mapping out
medium- to long-term action plans for developing bilateral ties.

China, he said, is willing to work with Germany to plan and design bilateral cooperation in various fields and build a bright future for China-Germany ties.

To that end, Xi suggested the two sides to be politically trustworthy friends, 
maintain regular high-level exchanges, strengthen communication on major issues and enhance strategic mutual trust.

Both sides should make full use of the some 60 cooperation mechanisms between 
them, including the strategic dialogue mechanism, while enhancing contacts between governments, political parties, parliaments, as well as think tanks of the two countries, Xi said, adding that efforts are also needed to intensify cooperation in such areas as diplomacy, law enforcement and counter-terrorism.

The two countries can also conduct dialogue on issues including human rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect, Xi said.

On economic cooperation, Xi suggested both sides to achieve a qualitative leap.

As the timing and condition for deepening strategic cooperation have been ripe, he urged both countries to expand two-way investment and trade, carry out more strategic projects of large scale, and undertake joint development and production.

More endeavors can be put on cooperation of smart manufacturing, internet of things, and the new generation of information technology, as well as collaboration on aeronautics and astronautics, maritime and polar matters, the Chinese leader said.

According to Xi, China supports the construction of a China-Germany agricultural center, and the two sides can hold regular high-level fiscal and financial dialogues.

Xi also pointed out that China welcomes the establishment of an RMB clearing and 
settlement mechanism in Frankfurt, as well as Germany's active participation in building the Silk Road economic belt.

Meanwhile, Xi suggested the two countries to strengthen cultural exchanges, continue to hold major cultural events in each other's country and establish a high-level mechanism for bilateral cultural exchanges.

Both sides should also strengthen education, tourism cooperation and collaboration between local governments, promote people-to-people exchanges and facilitate the exchange of personnel between the two countries, Xi noted.

At the same time, Xi suggested China and Germany to maintain effective communication in international affairs, jointly promote diplomatic solutions to regional hotspot issues.

Both sides should strengthen coordination and cooperation within the United Nations, the Group of 20 and other multilateral mechanisms so as to jointly cope with global challenges, promote the reform of the international system and improve global governance.

Meanwhile, both countries should commit themselves to deepening the China-European Union (EU) comprehensive strategic partnership, safeguarding and promoting a free trade system, and pushing for an early harvest of the negotiations on EU-China investmen
t pact, Xi said, adding that the two countries should work for an early launch of joint feasibility study of the China-EU free trade zone, and settlement of China-EU trade and investment disputes through dialogue and consultation.

For her part, Merkel lauded the continuing high-level development of bilateral ties, the positive exchanges in all areas and facets, as well as the strong economic cooperation between the two countries.

Germany understands the many challenges that China faces, and supports China's 
stability and development, she said, adding that her country is willing to promote political dialogues and people-to-people exchanges with China, and deepen mutual understanding and mutual trust.

Merkel noted that Germany is also ready to expand cooperation with China in such 
areas as economy and trade, investment, finance, energy and environmental protection.

Earlier Friday, Xi arrived in Germany for a state visit. It is the third leg of his ongoing four-nation European trip, which also includes the Netherlands, France and Belgium.

338109312883186_804317856262327,"Rapid expansion of China's P2P lending spells trouble

Zhang Yutang has made several trips to Xiaogan City of central China's Hubei Province hoping to get back the 300,000 yuan (48,300 U.S. dollars) he invested in a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending program. The businessman from east China's Zhejiang Province has always returned empty-handed. 
   
He entered into the deal via Xiaogan-based Tianlidai, a P2P online platform, which went bust in October.
   
Instead of serving as an intermediary for lenders and borrowers as it should, Tianlidai pooled investors' money to fund its own projects. When projects failed, lenders failed to get repaid.
   
""It's hard to tell which P2P platform is rule-abiding,"" Zhang said. ""Their promises of guaranteed repayment are often a sham.""
   
Tianlidai is not an isolated case. Over 70 P2P platforms collapsed last year, around 60 in the fourth quarter. The alarming rate has alerted investors of the default risks accompanying promised high returns and made tougher regulation necessary.
   
   
ANGEL OR DEVIL?
   
P2P lending is the practice of lending money to unrelated individuals that bypass the banking industry. It was introduced to China in 2006.
   
With stock market performances disappointing and banks' deposit rates at very low levels, investors resort to P2P sites hoping to bolster their returns. 
   
P2P lending boosted annual investment returns of 15 to 20 percent, which means that investors can get four to six times the returns on bank deposits.
   
It is not only a boon for investors, but also provides hope for cash-hungry individuals whose need for financing services are often ignored by big banks.
   
Rags-to-riches stories propped by P2P money have made headlines, elevating the status of this new mode of financing and people's interest in it. The industry is flourishing, without much government supervision.
   
By the end of 2013, the number of P2P lending companies in China had exceeded 800 with a yearly turnover of 100 billion yuan, according to Wangdaizhijia (home of online lending), a web portal that tracks the industry.
   
No threshold, no industry standard and no regulation -- these factors have contributed to the wild growth of the P2P industry, said Huang Zhen, a professor of law with the Central University of Finance and Economics.
   
The wild expansion and escalating competition have pushed up interest rates. Some P2P firms even promised annual returns of over 40 percent to woo investors, thus increasing default risks.
   
Many P2P online platforms are just a transmogrification of former players in the private lending market, who lack a thorough understanding of liquidity management, according to Xu Hongwei, a senior executive of Wangdaizhijia.
   
Systemic risks are building up due to the absence of regulators and the industry's frenetic need for growth to offset the risks, said Bai Chengyu, general secretary of China Association of Microfinance.
   
Xu estimated that 80 or 90 percent of China's P2P companies might sink.

   
REGULATION NEEDED
   
Recognizing the importance of P2P lending in supporting economic growth, analysts have called for more regulation so the industry can expand healthily.
   
Professional supervisory agencies should be in place as P2P online platforms have no boundaries and their activities are elusive by nature, said Xu, adding restrictions should be exerted on areas including registered capital, lending leverage, reserve ratio and single loan limits.
   
Qi Shouyan, CEO of P2P platform Yiqihao, said China's P2P industry must improve risk control.
   
The central bank has urged the establishment of China's Internet Finance Association, which would exercise proper oversight on the P2P sector.
  
The bankrupt P2P platforms constitute a small fraction of the whole industry and healthy growth can be expected with sufficient financial oversight, said Zhao Ruobing, an official with CreditEase, a leading Chinese micro-credit firm.
   
""I will not give up investing through P2P lending as it is more profitable than putting money in my bank account,"" said Zhang Yutang. ""But I will shun companies that promise excessive high returns and place my bet on safer ones even though with relatively lower returns.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/804317856262327/?type=3,2014-03-28 07:14:37,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
338109312883186_804217172939062,"Chinese President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart, Francois Hollande, pledged in Paris on Thursday to open up a new chapter in bilateral ties.

The two heads of state made the promise at a gathering to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between their countries.

Half a century ago, Chairman Mao Zedong and President Charles de Gaulle made the historic decision to set up China-France diplomatic relations, noted the Chinese president.

Interaction between the two countries, he said, has since become a special major-country relationship in the world, and has always been one of the most developed between China and major Western nations.

Xi attributed the feat to the spirit of independence, mutual understanding, visionary thinking and win-win cooperation, which he said is of great significance to the pursuit of a more beautiful future for bilateral relations.

Noting that the China-France relationship is now at an important moment of history, he called on the two sides to chart a better course for bilateral ties and make their bond ever closer, more sustainable and more special.

Xi suggested that the two countries continue respecting and trusting each other, firmly keep the development of bilateral ties on the right path, support their respective efforts in safeguarding such core interests as sovereignty, security and development, and strengthen strategic talks and cooperation.

The two nations, he said, should also uphold the spirit of mutual benefit, cultivate more common interests, and boost economic cooperation, so as to further consolidate the economic foundation of bilateral relations.

Meanwhile, the two sides need to actively promote friendly exchanges between all walks of life of the two nations, added the Chinese president.

China and France, he proposed, should also stick to the spirit of openness and enterprise, oppose trade protectionism, enhance coordination on macro-economic policy, and push forward reforms in international economic, financial and monetary systems, so as to promote global economic growth.

Moreover, China and France should step up coordination in handling international and regional affairs, and jointly address global challenges, so as to turn China-France relations into a major force for world peace and human progress, said the Chinese president.

Addressing the event, Hollande recalled that 50 years ago France became the first major Western country to forge diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, which demonstrated the two nations' friendship and foresight.

Hollande lauded China's remarkable development ever since, particularly its ascent to the world's second largest economy and its rising international status and influence.

Additionally, he noted that his country has also made continuous strides forward, and is now the second largest economy inside the European Union.

As the two countries are both pursuing reform and innovation, they provide development opportunities for each other, Hollande said, adding that his country is willing to comprehensively boost bilateral strategic cooperation and usher in a new era in bilateral relations.

France is the second leg of Xi's ongoing Europe trip, which will also take him to Germany and Belgium. Before France, Xi visited the Netherlands and attended the third Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague.

Xi, who is in France for a state visit, made the appeal in a speech delivered at the headquarters of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris on Thursday.
   
Inter-civilization exchanges and mutual learning, he said, should be given full play as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human progress and a strong bond for world peace.
   
""To promote exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, we must adopt a right approach with some important principles,"" Xi pointed out.
   
""First, civilizations have come in different colors, and such diversity has made exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations relevant and valuable,"" he said.
   
Exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations must not be built on the exclusive praise or belittling of one particular civilization, Xi said.
   
""Second, civilizations are equal, and such equality has made exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations possible,"" he said.
   
All civilizations have their respective strengths and shortcomings, he noted, adding that there is no perfect civilization in the world, nor is there a civilization that is devoid of any merit.
   
""No one civilization can be judged superior to another,"" he said.
   
""Third, civilizations are inclusive, and such inclusiveness has given exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations the needed drive to move forward,"" he said.
   
History shows that only through exchanges and mutual learning can a civilization be filled with vitality, Xi said. ""If all civilizations can uphold inclusiveness, the so-called 'clash of civilizations' will be out of the question and the harmony of civilizations will become reality.""
   
With the world consisting of different cultures, ethnic groups, skin colors, religions and social systems, the people of various countries have become members of an intimate community of shared destiny, said Xi.
   
""We should seek wisdom and nourishment from various civilizations to provide support and consolation for people's mind, and work together to tackle the challenges facing mankind,"" he said.
   
The Chinese leader also called on the world to develop education more actively, as education is ""an effective vehicle for the continuation and creation of civilizations.""
   
Expounding on the Chinese dream, Xi said the Chinese dream is about prosperity of the country, rejuvenation of the nation, and happiness of the people.
   
""The Chinese dream will be realized through balanced development and mutual reinforcement of material and cultural progress,"" he said. ""The Chinese people will encourage creative shifts and innovative development of the Chinese civilization in keeping with the progress of the times.""
   
""The Chinese civilization, together with the rich and colorful civilizations created by the people of other countries, will provide mankind with the right cultural guidance and strong motivation,"" he added.

About 200 relatives watched a live broadcast of the prime minister's press briefing in Beijing's Metro Park Lido Hotel.

One of the giant Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft was the first to head for the search area, taking off from Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Pearce just north of the southwest Australian city of Perth at 8:45 a.m. local time.

It was followed by an RAAF P3 Orion at 9 a.m. and then the other Chinese IL-76 took off at 9:20 a.m., beginning the seventh day of the Australian-controlled air search over the southern Indian Ocean.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which is overseeing the search, has been staggering the flights as they manage the short search window each aircraft has at the two search areas after flying about 2,500 km from Perth.

Two ultra-long range civil jets departed at about 10:10 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. and a second RAAF P3 Orion was scheduled to depart about 11 a.m.. 

A third ultra-long range jet was scheduled to take off about midday, followed by a U.S. Navy P8 Poseidon aircraft at 1 p.m. and two Japanese P3 Orion aircraft after 4 p.m..

The 10 aircraft joining the Monday search mission was up from eight the day before as the two search areas in close proximity were expanded from a total 59,000 square km to 68,500 square km.

AMSA was using all satellite imagery and information available in its search area development. 

The weather forecast in the search area is expected to deteriorate with rain likely. 

Searchers are now looking for objects spotted in three sets of satellite photos: U.S. images taken on March 16, Chinese images taken two days later, and French images, which were still being studied and emerged on Sunday.

Both sides should maintain close high-level exchanges, speed up negotiations on the China-ROK free trade pact and reach an agreement at an early date, Xi said.

Xi also called on both sides to strengthen communication and coordination on major international and regional issues to safeguard common interests.

Xi thanked the ROK president for the planned transfer of the remains of Chinese soldiers killed in the Korean War back to China.

Park, for her part, hailed the successful cooperation between the two countries. She expressed gratitude for the establishment of a memorial by the Chinese side to commemorate Ahn Jung Geun, a Korean patriot who shot dead a top Japanese official in 1909 for the independence of his motherland and peace in East Asia, as well as for the Chinese side' ongoing construction of a memorial stone at the former barracks of the Korean Liberation Army in the northwestern Chinese city of Xi'an.

Chinese relatives reacted calmly on hearing the news that satellite imagery had spotted two objects in the Indian Ocean and could be linked to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.
   
Twelve days after the jet disappeared with 239 people on board, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott made the announcement about the sighting on Thursday.
 
Relatives have lived in hope and despair for almost two weeks.
   
SILENCE OF ANXIETY

Cigarette smoke filled the briefing room of the Metro Park Lido Hotel, where airline officials have been holding daily briefings.
   
The hotel has been home to relatives of the passengers since the plane went missing. A member of staff told Xinhua some 200 relatives were staying in the hotel. Others have returned home.
   
People gathered in the briefing room and quietly watched the live broadcast of the Australian press conference at 12:30 p.m. Beijing Time. 
   
A few ladies wiped their tears. Others looked tired, resting on the back of the chairs in front of them.
   
When an Australian spokesman mentioned ""survivors"", loud sighs were heard in the room.
   
""So they've found them?"" someone asked. ""Nothing has been confirmed,"" said another.
   
Many left the room after the press conference, looking calm but tired with dark eyes.
   
Staff and volunteers were inside the room to help the relatives.

WANTING INFORMATION 
   
Word circulated in the briefing room that a team of senior officials and military representatives from Malaysia was expected to arrive in Beijing on Thursday night and they would meet the families. It stirred few emotions.
   
The relatives, sitting around in small groups, discussed what questions to ask later. A woman with a Beijing accent said, ""We should think about our questions. We want more information.""
   
A middle-aged man, wearing a suit and glasses, from east China's Shandong Province, was every so often informing a group of people the latest news coming from the foreign media.
   
During discussions, claiming compensation was spoken about.  
   
An American lawyer Keke Feng, co-counsel with the U.S.-based Motley Rice law firm, told Xinhua that she had been invited by relatives to deal with possible compensation.

Feng's practice, one of America's largest litigation firms, has dealt with major settlements, including the fatal Air France crash in 2009, the Asiana Airlines crash in 2013, and the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.
   
However, most relatives are still focusing on the search. ""What we need is for them to be safe and sound,"" said a relative.

338109312883186_800192770008169,"Commentary: Michelle's visit unique chance for China-U.S. ties

U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama arrives in Beijing on Thursday for a week-long visit to be focused on educational and cultural exchanges.

Given that first ladies are unique ambassadors for the United States, the trip stands out as a stroke of ""gentle diplomacy"" on the part of Washington.

Since President Barack Obama took office in 2009, deepening relations with Beijing has been one of his foreign policy priorities, and bilateral ties have generally moved in the right direction.

However, the globally significant trans-Pacific relationship has also witnessed strain due to some irresponsible moves by Washington, such as its meddling in South China Sea territorial disputes and Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama last month.

In addition, President Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" strategy has generated new uncertainties in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly East Asia, to the detriment of Washington's own trustworthiness with China.

Against such a background, Michelle's trip is especially meaningful. For starters, it comes on the 35th anniversary of the establishment of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.

Though dedicated to promoting people-to-people interaction between the two nations, the visit presents a unique opportunity to boost mutual understanding and promote bilateral ties in a broader scope.

Moreover, a strengthened personal bond between the first families of China and the United States will naturally help generate better understanding and more common ground between Beijing and Washington.

Of particular significance is Michelle's rich interaction with Chinese students, which will help boost the mutual understanding and friendship between the younger generations of the two nations, who shoulder the future of bilateral relations.

When briefing the media about Michelle's trip, the U.S. side said the first lady is to steer clear of politics, human rights, trade disputes and other bilateral differences -- issues better handled via official diplomacy.

That approach is right. The uniqueness of the role of first ladies is its soft touch and freedom from the knottiness and even ugliness of hard politics.

Although it would be naive to expect Michelle's visit to iron out all differences between China and the United States, it is safe to say that a successful visit by Michelle will infuse fresh vigor into the development of bilateral relations.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/800192770008169/?type=3,2014-03-20 21:27:13,8,0,1,8,0,0,0,0,0

China is considering a plan to expand a major Siberian tiger reserve in the northeast and move out half of the local residents in order to better protect the rare species, an official said Thursday.

The Hunchun National Siberian Tiger Nature Reserve in Jilin Province will be increased by 524 hectares in area if the proposed plan is adopted by the State Council, China's cabinet, said Lang Jianmin, director of the reserve's scientific research and publicity center.

The State Forestry Administration has already approved the plan, which will see half of the 6,000 residents currently living in the reserve relocated, according to Lang.

The remaining residents in the reserve will gradually move out of it along with the local urbanization process, he added.

The move aims to reduce human disturbance to wild Siberian tigers as deforestation by locals, and their frog breeding businesses in the reserve affect the tigers' living environment, according to the official.  

The reserve, currently at 100,000 hectares, has 70 percent of its land owned by the state, while the remaining 30 percent by farmers.

Huang said that he had witnessed a steady rise of popcorn sales, and expected more to come in the future as movie watching habits are taking shape step by step.
   
The high sale of popcorn is an epitome of the nation's rapid growing movie market and a boom in cinema building.
   
According to film market research company Entgroup, currently there are about 18,000 screens in China, compared with 3,000 screens in 2007. The market registered 21.8 billion yuan of ticket sales in 2013, also a year-on-year increase of 54.3 percent.

338109312883186_799249616769151,"Analysis: Cash flow problems could lead to developers defaulting

A headline-making debt woe afflicting a small Chinese property developer has highlighted an ongoing cash-flow headache in the sector. Industry analysts said they expected some smaller companies to default and home prices to decline in third- and fourth-tier cities.

Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co., a privately-owned small developer in east China's Ningbo City, is struggling to pay a 3.5-billion-yuan (570.5 million U.S. dollars) debt after its capital chain snapped.

Of the debt, some 2.4 billion yuan was borrowed from banks, who are working with local governments to find solutions. Two owners of the real estate firm have been detained by police on suspicion of illegal fundraising.

A preliminary investigation showed that plummeting land prices was one of the major contributors to the money crunch. It is estimated that the company has lost about 1.4 billion yuan from its purchased land because of shrinking value.

Most of Zhejiang Xingrun's business was in Fenghua, a small city under Ningbo. Fenghua has a population of about 500,000. Its land price at the end of 2013 was approximately halved compared with that in early 2010.

""There are high stockpiles in medium and small cities, and the performance of developers based in third- and fourth-tier cities was sluggish in the first two months of 2014,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agent Centaline.

A possible default by Zhejiang Xingrun is ""symptomatic of major themes in the industry -- polarization in favor of larger, better funded homebuilders; oversupply in smaller cities; and significantly slower growth rates and profit margins,"" Fitch Ratings said in a note.

Zhejiang Xingrun had run into trouble since, firstly, it is a privately owned company, meaning it has limited access to equity funding. Chinese regulations limit the ability of homebuilders to use bank borrowings to purchase land, Fitch said.

Private companies are likely to be more reliant on non-traditional sources like trust funding, which come with high costs.

Second, its core market, Fenghua, is showing signs of overbuilding. Finally, key shareholders of Zhejiang Xingrun were arrested relating to illegal fundraising, which suggests a significant corporate governance lapse.

""We believe there will be further defaults in this industry as these themes will persist, but they will be limited to smaller companies like Zhejiang Xingrun,"" Fitch said.

Zhang Zhiwei, chief China economist with Japan's Nomura Securities, shared similar views.

Zhejiang Xingrun is the largest property developer in recent years that is at risk of bankruptcy, Zhang said.

""More property developers will face similar pressures as transaction volumes slow and cash flow conditions tighten, and expect this problem to be more severe for unlisted developers in third- and fourth-tier cities with limited access to financing,"" he said in a research note.

--an agreement to renegotiate the 1986 Double Tax Agreement;
--implementation of a mutual recognition agreement for testing, inspection and certification of electrical products, making New Zealand the first country to have such an agreement with China;
--enhanced agricultural cooperation in dairy herd improvement, agricultural management, veterinary training scholarships and professional development exchanges;
--improved food safety cooperation including the launch of a scholarship program in food safety and risk management.

The parliament has also formally sent application to the Kremlin to become a part of the Russian Federation as a new republic.
   
While the Ukrainian authorities peremptorily rejected the legitimacy of a referendum, which had paved the way for Crimea's independence, experts here were divided about the fate of the Black Sea peninsula after the decision to secede from Ukraine.
   
Ukrainian officials were unanimous about Sunday's voting in their statements, saying that the referendum violates the Ukrainian constitution while urging the international community to ignore its results.

However, some political analysts here doubted that Crimea would become part of Russia in the near future.
   
""Crimea's accession to Russia is practically impossible. It would trigger international sanctions and economic blockade. In addition, Crimea requires financial injections, which may become a burden on Russian economy and infrastructure,"" said Konstantin Matvienko, an expert with the Strategic Consulting Corporation ""Gardarika"".
   
The Crimean economy, which is 52 percent supported by the Ukrainian state, is facing serious economic challenges this year as its main industries, namely tourism and agriculture, were hit hard by the ongoing crisis.
   
Although some Ukrainians believe that the independence of Crimea, which has been heavily subsidized by the government for two decades, would benefit the country financially, experts feel Kiev would not abandon its plans to retrieve the peninsula and preserve the territorial integrity of the state.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday the disappearance of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet was deliberate, and the authorities have refocused their investigation into its crew and passengers. But he stopped short of confirming a hijack. 
   
""Based on new satellite information, we can say with a high degree of certainty that the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system, or ACARS, was disabled just before the aircraft reached the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia,"" he told a press conference near the capital's International Airport.
   
Shortly afterwards, near the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese air traffic control, the aircraft's transponder, which communicates with civilian air traffic controllers, was switched off.
   
Citing Malaysian air force radar data, the prime minister said the missing flight did indeed turn back, then flew westward back over Peninsula Malaysia before turning northwest. 
   
""These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,"" he said. 
   
He also said the last confirmed signal between the plane and a satellite came at 8:11 a.m. Malaysian time on March 8, about seven hours and 31 minutes after takeoff.
   
Based on the new data, the Malaysian authorities are now trying to trace the missing jet in one of the two possible corridors -- a northern one from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, and a southern one stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.
   
""In view of this latest development, the Malaysian authorities have refocused their investigation into the crew and passengers on board,"" the prime minister said. ""Despite media reports that the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear: we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate from its original flight path.""
   
Earlier, media reports quoted some experts as saying that one of the pilots or someone else with flying experience hijacked the plane or committed suicide by plunging the jet into the sea.
   
Meanwhile, the prime minister said the search in the South China Sea would be ended, and the authorities are reassessing the redeployment of assets.
   
""Clearly, the search for MH 370 has entered a new phase,"" he said.
   
Upon Malaysia's decision to end operation in the South China Sea, Vietnam, which has joined the search mission from the first day the plane disappeared, has decided to end the hunt for the plane.

338109312883186_797105496983563,"Jade Rabbit: China's robotic lunar adventurer

Lunar rover Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, roused from its third lunar night slumber on Friday, stretching its arms in the sun after its dormancy in temperatures as low as minus 180 degrees Celsius. People on Earth were relieved by its greeting on an online diary posted under the name ""Lunar Rover Yutu.""

""Don't poke me... I'm already up!"" the six-foot robot told the 600,000-strong followers of the blog, who had been crossing their fingers that the rover would survive its second sleep since a mechanical abnormality was spotted at the end of January.
   

""Any carrot pie for me?"" Yutu asked upon waking on March 14, a day celebrated by mathematics enthusiasts as ""Pi Day"" in honor of the famous ratio's first few digits, 3.14.
   

Named after the pet rabbit of moon goddess Chang'e from Chinese legend, the lunar rover largely stayed out of the spotlight until news came that a mechanical control abnormality prior to its second dormancy might cripple the robot.
   
The news meant that Yutu might never wake up when dawn greeted the moon.
   
The vehicle had been on the moon for 42 days and traveled for more than 100 meters when its second lunar night, equivalent to a fortnight on Earth, fell on Jan. 25. The mechanical errors posed a survival challenge for the country's first moon rover.

Online communities worried about the fate of Jade Rabbit after a post on Sina Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, said, ""Ah, I'm broken,"" telling people that the rover ""might not make it through this moon night.""
   
""I thought I could hop around here for three months, but if this trip ends prematurely, I'm not afraid,"" said the blog entry.
   
The unverified Weibo account ""Lunar Rover Yutu"" began keeping a diary for the robot, written in a rabbit's voice, on Dec. 1, one day before the rover's launch.
   
The farewell message attracted broader attention to both the rover and the blog account.
   
Its last words, ""Good night, Earth. Good night, humanity,"" prompted both tears and prayers from ""rabbit fans.""
   
Blessings flooded social media and the blogosphere, with fans saying, ""Wake up, rabbit!"" and ""Come on, bunny! We all stand by you!""
   
The Weibo account remained silent for two weeks, with its followers prepared for the worst until Feb. 13, when the robot announced its survival by asking, ""Hi, anyone there?""
   
The post went viral with over 119,000 reposts, 72,000 comments and 85,000 likes. Even overseas netizens and media joined to hail Yutu's survival.

Xi, also chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), made the remarks during the first plenary meeting of the group under the CMC.
   
CMC vice chairmen Fan Changlong and Xu Qiliang serve as the leading group's deputy heads.
   
""National defense and military reform are an important part and an important symbol of China's overall reform,"" Xi said.
   
With ""being able to combat and win battles"" as the focus, Xi said the reform should target key problems in strengthening combat preparedness and weak links in honing combat effectiveness.
   
The president urged deepening reform to modernize army establishments.
   
Reform of the commanding system, power structure and related policies should be advanced to support the consolidation of national defense and the building of strong armed forces, according to Xi.
   
The reform should ensure the Communist Party of China (CPC)'s absolute leadership over the military, Xi said.
   
The president warned, however, that reform must be carried out in an ""active yet prudent"" manner.
   
Things requiring change must be reformed in a timely, courageous and determined way, he said.
   
""Important reform measures must be taken prudently because a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole,"" he said, adding that repeated reviews and scientific assessment are needed before a move is introduced.

338109312883186_796678897026223,"Commentary: Why the big silence on missing flight?

While technology today can track a truck on a highway every second along its way, it seems bizarre that a widebody jet can just vanish, with neither signal nor trace of wreckage.

After almost a week, there is some evidence to indicate that flight MH370 may have flown westward for a few hours after it disappeared from radar scenes. Signals automatically and instantaneously transmitted via satellite back to ground control took a week to reach the public.

Why is the silence on the missing flight being kept so long?
   
In an age when many are fed up with the scandal of technologically superior companies randomly collecting client information through designated ""back doors"" to utilize big data for business or national security concerns, has Boeing not yet developed an all-weather real-time monitoring network for its global assets, for whatever purpose?
   
A product of human civilization the size of a jumbo jet should not simply vanish so easily.
   
With no deep throats from the industry or military, people pinned their hopes on naval vessels. Chinese and Vietnamese vessels, for example, combed the sea area again and again, while some already knew for sure that search and rescue missions would be in vain.
   
A week has passed, with officials largely silent.
   
More unauthorized deep throats are encouraged to leak information which authorities remain silent on, for whatever reasons.
   
Without ruling out the possibility of terrorism, and with live signals detailing the unusual flight pattern of MH370, Western governments are conspicuously tight-lipped on terrorism speculations, quite different from their reactions to Pan Am Flight 103 which crashed on Lockerbie, Great Britain, in 1988.
   
Fear and desperation among families and friends of passengers are growing amid an absence of information. The international search and rescue mission, if still worthwhile after the whole week, has been marred by confusion, early mistakes and lack of information.
   
The fear has deepened. Three unidentified sources reportedly updated the world that military radar data suggested the plane was deliberately flown hundreds of miles to the west, a huge deviation from the scheduled Kuala Lumpur-Beijing route, along corridors normally employed for flights to the Middle East and Europe.
   
The week of searching in waters east of Malaysia may have been for nothing.
   
Mounting evidence points to the theory that, including the possibilities of pilot error or terrorist activity, the loss of MH370 with 239 people on board is a man-made event rather than the result of a mechanical breakdown.
   
If sabotage is not ruled out, withholding information from the public can be dangerous, even lethal.
   
Silence, sometimes, can kill.
   
Waiting in desperation, a cancer patient in China died without knowing the whereabouts of his child on board, alive or dead.
   
More people are waiting, hopefully or hopelessly.

China on Friday urged Japan to explain its massive stockpile of nuclear material, which has allegedly exceeded the country's demand and might increase as Japan re-launches nuclear power plants.

""It's not only the United States and Western society that have raised doubts and concern about Japan's nuclear stockpile, which has far exceeded its demand,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.

Questions have also emerged from within Japan and from the international community, he said at a daily briefing.

Hong made the remarks when asked to comment on Japan's nuclear stockpile and the capacity and security of Japan's Rokkasho Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Facility, which is set to open this October.

The new nuclear material factory, the fifth-largest of its kind in the world, allegedly has security risks. It will reportedly be able to produce 96 tonnes of plutonium metal in the next dozen years, far more than all stocks that remain in the United States as a legacy of the Cold War.

""What if a massive amount of nuclear material is to be produced as Japan restarts its nuclear plants? Will it worsen the existing imbalance between its demand and supply of nuclear material?"" Hong asked.

""Such questions have not been addressed so far. Is there a hidden problem?"" he added.

Hong urged the Japanese government to face the concerns and explain in detail the imbalance of sensitive nuclear material in the country.

The United States gave 331 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium to Japan during the Cold War, Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported in late January. Japan holds another 44 tonnes of plutonium, which could be used for nuclear reactors.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/796655083695271/?type=3,2014-03-14 10:05:36,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
338109312883186_796648067029306,"News Analysis: Deflation worries haunt eurozone, though not as much 

The euro area is facing a risk of deflation, but its probability is still low due to economic recovery, economists said on Friday.
   
""We think the eurozone economic recovery will continue in 2014 and 2015, which we forecast 1.1 percent and 1.4 percent real GDP growth respectively. This would make an increase in domestic disinflationary pressures unlikely, as we do not expect the negative output gap to widen further,"" said Gergely Kiss, director of sovereigns at Fitch Ratings, in a analysis piece.
   
Even so, due to the latest inflation rate cooling to 0.8 percent in Feb. 2014, well below the ECB's target of 2 percent, the sustained lower average inflation will be longer and more costly to the peripheral countries' recovery of lost competitiveness than the core member states, said Kiss.
   
The European Central Bank could face political and legal challenges if it tried to embark on quantitative easing, as the benchmark interest rate has been already near the zero lower bound, added Kiss.
   
Although the international credit rating company does not expect a further decline in eurozone core inflation in the near term, Fitch warns that the protracted adjustment in the periphery, combined with rice and wage stickiness, would add to the costs of periphery rebalancing, increase the real value of the debt burden and ultimately add to deflation risks.
   
""While inflation is being suppressed in the eurozone, the region's medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored. This was not the case in Japan, where these expectations eventually deanchored,"" said Kevin Gardiner, chief investment officer at Barclays, in a weekly market report.
   
According to Barclays' projections, the inflation rate in the eurozone would be 1 percent this year, 1.3 percent in 2015 and 1.5 percent in 2016.
   
However, Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist, told Xinhua: ""There is a significant risk of deflation setting in some eurozone countries. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, is already close to zero in both France and Spain. And producer prices have been falling. Inflation is likely to remain very low because the economy is set for only weak growth.""
  
Meanwhile, the high unemployment rates in Spain and Greece, which are 26 and 28 percent respectively, suggest that there is likely to be significant downward pressure on wages in these countries, and in Italy the unemployment rate is still rising, warned Kenningham.
   
The London-based economic research company projects a 0.5 percent of inflation rate in eurozone in 2014 and 2015. It also forecasts a further loosening of ECB's monetary policy in the near future.

The curtains of China's annual parliamentary meetings drew to a close, charting a clear course as the world's second largest economy sails towards fresh waters with a reform-determined leadership at the helm.
   
The growth targets are set. The way to the end mapped out. But what kind of journey will China's growth experience in 2014?
   
The story will not be the epic of the stellar growth seen during the past three decades. Gone are the days when double-digit GDP growth was easy to achieve with low-cost and abundant labor, easy credit and massive investment. 
   
The leadership has realized the necessity and immediacy to steer the country's economy from investment-led expansion to consumption-fuelled growth.
   
Will it be a thriller? Some observers may favor this but that is the least possible script of China's future growth.
   
An economic hard landing with bursting property bubbles, chaos caused by runaway shadow banking and festering local government debt is a common fantasy among some observers. 

However, a Titanic-like crash scene is unlikely to take place as the risk-sensitive government has realized the gravity of the situation and taken drastic measures to rein in further worsening.
   
No doubt the journey ahead is going to be bumpy with the spectres of the above-mentioned haunting. 
   
So China's growth story this year is more likely to be an uphill journey, with treasures to hunt and barriers to cross.
   
China has targeted its GDP growth at around 7.5 percent and CPI at about 3.5 percent this year, generally in line with last year's target.
   
But these growth indicators are not the only treasures to hunt. More advantages and benefits from the ongoing and upcoming reforms on all fronts will provide the biggest surprises.
   
The financial sector is one of the key reform priorities outlined in the government work report. 

Bosses of the country's financial watchdogs said on Tuesday that China will liberalize deposit interest rates, roll out deposit insurance and set up private banks, all of which will rejuvenate the whole economy.
   
However, barriers are in the way. The country has to be aware of domestic traps of overcapacity, financial and debt risks and environmental degradation, while weathering the impact of volatile global financial markets. It is set to be an uphill journey. 
   
The knack for hurdle-leaping is reform. 
   
Reform is the top priority for the government's work this year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last week, four months after a key meeting in November outlined a wide-ranging reform package. 
   
""How can an arrow shot be turned back?"" Li said at Thursday's press conference. It might sound cliche, but painstaking reform seems to be the only path that China can take to juggle its different priorities.
   
Like all adventures, it takes guts and wits to carry on the journey. With utmost determination and concrete actions to push reforms, we will see a fascinating yet difficult balancing act of growth and reform, and hopefully a happy ending.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/796484283712351/?type=3,2014-03-14 02:12:05,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0
338109312883186_796112413749538,"Xinhua Insight: China's new energy drivers 

The use of new energy vehicles (NEV) was bolted on to the government work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang at the annual parliamentary session which ended on Thursday. With the potential to save energy and reduce emissions, the NEV industry will receive government support.

NEW ENERGY DRIVE
   
Decades of economic expansion have polluted China's air, water and soil, and the onus has shifted now from pollution to protection.
   
Some progress has already been made, and the general public have become more environment savvy, but pollution plays a big part in people's daily lives. Last month, smog covered nearly 20 percent of China's territory for a whole week.
   
At times like that, factories are shut down and construction halted. As a last resort, cars are pulled off roads.
   
Such expediency is singularly inconvenient for the public, and the authorities have been obliged to start being a bit more clever. While not exactly a revolutionary idea, vehicles that use alternative fuel and electricity are an option.
   
In 2010, NEVs began to be subsidized in five pilot cities to the tune of 60,000 yuan (9,800 U.S. dollars) for a battery powered vehicle and 50,000 yuan for a hybrid.
   
Last year, nearly 18,000 NEVs were sold, 14,600 of which ran on batteries. Henceforth, NEVs will be promoted in 83 cities.
   
BUMPY ROAD AHEAD
   
Thursday's announcement means a new round of government support for the NEV sector is on the way, but the road ahead is not entirely free from obstructions.
   
Safety of NEVs is questionable; the streets are hardly lined with the electric chargers needed to keep these vehicles rolling along. There is a long way to go before the industry wins popular support and helps reverse environmental decay.
   
Earlier this year, some electric cars caught fire in China, sparking concerns about batteries. Several models from industry poster boy Tesla have burned up in the United States, but auto experts have tried to play down the safety issues, claiming that NEVs are less fire-prone than traditional cars with their large tanks filled with highly inflammable liquid.
   
According to the China Battery Industry Association, NEV batteries made by domestic producers are generally safe, as are Tesla batteries. Fires involving Tesla cars were caused by outside forces not the cars' own technical problems, said Wang Jingzhong, deputy director of the association.
   
Aside from convincing the general public that NEVs are safe, the infrastructure (electric chargers) is much thinner on the ground than omnipresent gas stations. A flat tire is one thing, a flat battery, quite another. No one wants to be marooned in the middle of nowhere.
   
Given the state of the infrastructure and relatively high price tag of NEVs, auto analyst Jia Xinguang reckons price-sensitive Chinese consumers are more inclined to follow the herd and choose a comfortable, low-priced gasoline vehicle.
   
Though NEVs are prized by their limited environmental impact, the last obstacle arises from environmental concern. How spent batteries are disposed of?
   
In a recent interview with news portal Sina.com, Zhong Faping, director of National Engineering Research Center of Advanced Energy Storage Materials, said that NEV batteries are so big--500 kg--that their disposal is a real matter.

338109312883186_796080377086075,"Xinhua Insight: In-home nursing gains popularity in aging China

In-home nursing is emerging as a new choice in easing the pressure of China's aging population.
   
This week, the Chengguan District Virtual Nursing Home in Lanzhou City of northwest China's Gansu Province announced that it will incorporate more healthcare options as the services of this in-home care agency enjoy growing popularity.
   
According to local government data, by the end of 2012, more than 220,000 seniors had accessed the services of the agency since it began operating in 2009.
   
In-home care agencies, also dubbed ""virtual nursing homes,"" guarantee similar services as brick-and-mortar nursing homes. But they are delivered directly to people's addresses instead of in residential nursing facilities, which are generally very crowded.
   
The trend is taking on prominence as China grays more rapidly and conventional homes for the elderly face a shortfall in resources.
   
China now has a staggering 200 million people aged 60 and over. The number accounts for 14 percent of the total population, and is expected to surge to 400 million in 2050. 
   
But the country had a mere 40,000 nursing homes by the end of 2013. With less than 3.9 million beds available in those facilities, pressure from the glut is overwhelming.
   
It is in this context that virtual nursing homes have sprung up in provinces including Jiangsu, Gansu, Hunan and Anhui, offering convenience and slashed demand on resources. The first opened in Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province in 2007.
   
EMERGING INDUSTRY
   
Governments at all levels in China are taking pains to guide the development of virtual homes for the elderly.
   
In 2012, the municipality government of the northern city of Tianjin blazed the trail by teaming up with a domestic service provider called Emotte, extending the company's broad range of services to local communities, including house cleaning and meal deliveries.
   
In the past two years, a total of 14 traditional nursing homes in Tianjin have jumped on the bandwagon of offering door-to-door services to local seniors, a move which has proved economical while serving more customers.
   
The fledgling industry has won much praise from the aged, who tend to be more comfortable in the familiar environment of their own homes than in crowded nursing facilities.
   
Yin Yanbang, an 86-year-old Tianjin resident, said that he prefers the new model because he can stay at home and enjoy domestic services by simply making a phone call to the service provider.
   
Lin Shoujie, another Tianjin resident, shares the same view. Meal deliveries have saved him the trouble of cooking and contributed to his recovering health thanks to the nutritious food.
   
Li Ling, a carer who works for Emotte, attributed the company's popularity to its system of performance-related pay.
   
""I never shirk my responsibilities because my salary is directly linked with my performance,"" Li said, explaining that she gets her monthly income only after her client has given positive feedback to her employer.
    
Home-based nursing can also comfort old people's children working far away because they know that their parents are safe and sound at home and carefully looked after, according to Chen Li, an official with the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.

LURKING PROBLEMS
  
However, while the burgeoning industry is booming, it also faces a thicket of barriers that might stymie its future development.
   
""Some companies or nursing homes have worked with government bodies, while others just work on their own,"" said Fu Yanjuan, who is in charge of Emotte's branch in Tianjin.
   
Fu said that without sufficient tie-up with government bodies, it would be difficult for agencies like Emotte to win trust from the elderly.
   
Li Jiajun, president of Tianjin University, believes governments should initiate favorable policies and pump extra subsidies into these agencies as well as conventional care homes to assist their development.
   
""But governments are not omnipotent, and that means families and society should make joint efforts in the wake of a graying nation,"" Li added.
   
Zhang Surong, managing director of Huaxiajinguo Community Service Co. Ltd., a domestic services company in Anshan City of northwest China's Liaoning Province, agrees.
   
Zhang said that China should step up efforts in training staff in this field, urging that ""the government could consider subsidizing staff to cut the costs on the side of traditional nursing homes and companies.""

338109312883186_795995017094611,"Commentary: Why hasn't MH370 been found yet?

After six days of searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, can we still expect a modern version of the happy ending in Robinson Crusoe?
   
As of Thursday, we are far from having a clear picture of what happened. Most of what we have heard from briefings, denials and refusals to comment by investigating teams has served to deepen the mystery.
   
Among discrepancies in statements, the families of passengers on board the plane are waiting in desperate hope of a miracle bringing about the safe return of their loved ones. And people around the world look for signs of wreckage in an ocean as deep as their new worries about how to rely on aviation, believed to be the safest way to travel.
   
It is common to have confusion and misinformation in the initial hours of air disasters in any country. But after six days, we still don't know why there was not a single glimmer of a signal from the state-of-the-art and highly automated aircraft.
   
We have very limited information about the crew members except for the last words, ""good night,"" transmitted to ground controllers, a morsel of information which was not dispensed until Wednesday upon relatives' requests.
   
We still don't know why the last time of contact with the plane has been repeatedly revised, from 2:40 to 1:30 and then 2:15 a.m.
   
As for the greatest confusion, we still in fact don't know whether MH370 definitely turned back and crossed westward into the Malacca Strait.
   
U.S. investigators reportedly suspect the plane stayed in the air for about four hours after it reached its last confirmed location. If this is true, the Boeing 777200 could have reached as far as the Indian Ocean or even the Arabian Sea.
   
In 2009, an Air France Airbus A330 flying to Paris disappeared off the coast of Brazil and it took five days to find the site of the crash.
   
In the case of MH370, it was only after five days of searching off the east coast of Malaysia that military officials revealed their air defense radar detected an unidentified object early on Saturday north of the Malacca Strait off Malaysia's west coast.
   
Any tiny inaccuracy in such information can make a big difference to the search zone and, most importantly, the survival of 239 people.
   
As Malaysia Airlines is state owned, the Malaysian government is the core force in the fact-finding mission, but the home countries of passengers on board the plane have a right of access to the latest information so as to enhance the joint search and rescue.

338109312883186_795994870427959,"Chinese premier says GDP target flexible, stresses employment

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said there is a level of flexibility for the government's growth target at around 7.5 percent this year, stressing rather the importance of creating enough jobs.
   
""We are not preoccupied with GDP growth,"" Li stressed when asked on the lowest growth rate that the government can live with at a press conference following the conclusion of the annual legislative session.
   
""The growth that we want is one that brings real benefits to the people, helps raise the quality and efficiency of economic development, and contributes to energy conservation and environment protection,"" he said.
   
Li's elaboration came after the government announced last week that the country will target an unchanged growth of around 7.5 percent in 2014.
   
It also vowed to create 10 million more urban jobs to ensure the registered urban unemployment rate does not rise above 4.6 percent.
   
At the conference, Li underscored the importance of a proper growth to deliver enough urban jobs while leaving room for the six to seven million migrant workers to seek employment in cities.
  
China's economy grew 7.7 percent last year, but a set of data that pointed to softening manufacturing activity in recent months has renewed concerns on the growth outlook of the world's second largest economy.
   
In response to the concerns, Li emphasized that China's economy has ""tremendous potential and resilience"", and the country has the ability and conditions to keep its economic operation within a proper range.
   
The premier noted a spate of complex challenges for this year, including enhancing the quality and efficiency of economic development, tackling pollution and saving energy.
   
""So we need to strike a proper balance amidst all these goals and objectives. This is not going to be easy,"" Li acknowledged.
   
""We need to face up to the difficulties and challenges and make the most of the favorable conditions. This holds the secret of our success,"" he said, citing a Chinese proverb that ""only a sharpened axe can cut through firewood.""
   
Although China's 7.5 percent growth target is the same as previous years, its importance is fading as many believe the government will no longer view the figure as the necessary minimum as it usually did in the past.
   
Senior leaders and officials have on various occasions backed up the macro-economic control strategy featuring the idea of ""a proper range,"" -- a lower limit to ensure steady growth and job creation and an upper limit to avert inflation, which was first proposed by Li in July.
   
Finance minister Lou Jiwei joined the chorus last Thursday, calling for more comprehensive understanding on the country's growth target instead of merely fixating on the 7.5-percent figure.
   
GDP growth, inflation and employment are all key factors that should be taken into consideration when assessing economic conditions, Lou told a press conference, adding that a growth of 7.3 percent or 7.2 percent can still be counted within that range.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/795994870427959/?type=3,2014-03-13 03:53:09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Innovation holds key to China's economic restructuring and industrial upgrading, Premier Li Keqiang said last week in the government work report at the ongoing annual session of the country's top legislature.
   
From high-tech products to cutting-edge scientific research and development, China's drive to shift its role from ""the factory floor of the world"" to an inventor and innovator has become a hot topic at home and abroad. 
   
Xinhua reporters carried out a series of interviews around the world to sketch out how the foreigners think of the the China-developed products and the related developments.

DIALOGUE 1
   
Xinhua: Do you have anything developed and produced in China? How do you feel about them?
   
""I don't know it was made by China,"" said a Californian commuter Passti, referring to the BYD E-bus she is on. ""It's very comfortable, very clean and quiet, I love it ... It would be perfect if it has more space.""
   
The bus driver Derrick Smith also expressed his fondness for the bus.
   
""I actually like driving BYD's electric buses over any gas-fueled or CNG-fueled buses. They ride a lot smoother, cleaner; they feel a lot lighter, and the driver area is more comfortable,"" he said.
   
Beside electronic buses, China-designed cellphones have edged into the Western society.
   
""Of course I use the ZTE phones. I am proud to use it,"" said Nicklas Sivander, sales director of ZTE's Sweden office. ""It has all the features I need ... I also control my whole home music system with this smartphone. So it's my everyday tool.""

DIALOGUE 2

Xinhua: What are the competitive edges and weaknesses of Chinese manufactured products compared with their international competitors? 
   
""The (Chinese) technology is very good,"" said Brenden Riley, sales chief of BYD's North American office. ""My only concern with Chinese new tech is that I don't find the design so pretty yet, but that will come with time.""
   
Chinese-made products ""need to be cooler, prettier,"" Riley noted. ""The life cycle of high-tech products is short, so the international competition requires a different way, more localized ... I think it's coming but just not there yet.""
   
However, to Sivander, the tempting quality and price of Chinese mobiles made them successful in local market.
   
""We have all the features that any advanced smartphone has on the market right now,"" he said, ""The good thing with this phone is we can offer it with attractive price here in north Europe, which means that we are competing with the major player but giving more value for money.""
   
""What we need to improve our performance here is to work on our brand, to inform the consumers that ZTE exists and has designed proper products,"" Sivander suggested.

DIALOGUE 3

Xinhua: How is Chinese scientific groups' papers publication doing, in terms of originality, forwardness and growing rate?
   
According to data provided by Natasha D. Pinol, senior communications officer of science, almost 70 published original research papers have listed authors from China in 2010. But to 2013, the number has rocketed to 104.
   
Dr. Nick Campbell, executive editor of Nature, also said increasing research papers from China have been published in his journals in recent years.
   
""From 2008 to 2012 we saw the contribution from Chinese authors to papers in Nature rapidly increase to 2.5 percent in 2012 compared to 1.5 percent in 2008,"" he said. ""Over the same period China' share of papers in all Nature journals were more than doubled, from 1.5 percent to 4.2 percent.""
   
The editor told Xinhua that the Chinese Academy of Sciences has replaced the University of Tokyo in January 2013 as the largest institutional contributor to Nature in the Asia-Pacific.
   
""All indications at this stage are that this pattern of growth has continued,"" said Campbell. ""Our criteria for selection focus on original findings of outstanding significance that are of interest to an interdisciplinary readership... in broad terms, an improvement in the number of Chinese researchers that are meeting these exacting standards in their papers.""

DIALOGUE 4

Xinhua: China has made considerate investment in scientific R&D. Can you tell us how is China's research output compared with that of the West? What should be underlined in China's reform of its scientific and research system in your opinion?
   
""Government support for science clearly helps to speed scientific advancement,"" said Pinol. ""Adequate federal support for research and development is essential to innovation. China's leaders clearly recognize the connection between increased government support for science and the discoveries that drive economic prosperity.""
   
As for Campbell, he said research-output efficiency is not a trivial thing to measure.
   
""We would never suggest that you should use publications in Nature journals,"" he said. ""Nonetheless we can at least look at how countries do relative to their total number of researchers. These figures show that China's contribution to these journals is lower than smaller Asia-Pacific countries such as Australia and Singapore, and the largest global contributors to Nature journals, the USA and UK.""
   
However, the executive editor argued that there is no perfect way of organizing a research funding system. 
   
""Many nations are struggling to strike an appropriate balance bet,"" he said. ""Like all nations, China needs to continue to focus on improvements that reward high quality research outcomes and help leverage that research to ultimately make a substantive positive impact on broader society.""

338109312883186_795555700471876,"New push to reshape China banking landscape

""If the banks won't change, we will make them change."" The confident and prophetic words from e-billionaire Jack Ma five years ago still ring true as China introduces a round of intensive changes that are poised to rock China's banking sector.
   
On Tuesday, authorities said China is likely to drop interest rate controls within two years, giving a clear timetable on interest rate liberalization after years of talk.
   
On the same day, authorities said they will approve five private banks on a trial basis, the latest move in opening the previously closed sector to private capital.
   
Some bemoan the passing of the good old days for the banks as these imminent policies mean they cannot reap easy and fat profits from the previous spread between a ceiling on the savings deposit rate and a floor on bank lending rates. Others are cheered by the prospect of better financial services as competition is sure to escalate when more players join the game.
   
Whether they welcome or dread the shift, they have to realize that the upcoming banking reforms are inevitable as China busies itself with retooling the economy. The best response is to prepare for the changes.

DIVERSIFIED PLAYERS
   
Though the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has long encouraged banks to diversify their portfolios by providing more services to the private sector, banking dinosaurs have been reluctant to do so.
  
Loans to large state-owned firms have always been a preferred choice due to stereotypical thinking that their payment is guaranteed. In contrast, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often given a cold shoulder, even though they account for over 60 percent of gross domestic product. Without government backing, loans to SMEs are considered risky.
   
Moreover, banks have chosen to ignore the needs of small businesses and individual consumers as profits are hefty and assured already due to the government-imposed ceiling on the deposit rate and a floor on bank lending rates.
   
Though the authorities have made headway in interest rate liberalization over the years, they have felt strong opposition from the banks when it comes to the last part of the process, namely freeing up savings deposit rates.
   
The stale banking landscape has been shaken up as a handful of Internet companies, such as Jack Ma's Alibaba, weighed in to offer a wide range of investment and financial services.
   
Internet financial products like money market fund Yu'ebao created by Alibaba have been instant hits among the Chinese public. They have pulled money from traditional banks, which offer a maximum interest rate for one-year deposits of 3.3 percent, and moved it to web-based money market funds like Yu'ebao, which offer a seven-day annualized yield of nearly 6 percent.
   
The better interest rate enabled Yu'ebao to attract 81 million users with aggregate deposits estimated at around 500 billion yuan (81 billion U.S. dollars) in just nine months.
   
Though Yu'ebao and its peers are labeled ""blood-suckers"" by some commentators, they have recently won government recognition. China won't ban web-based financial products like Yu'ebao, but will strengthen regulation to guide the healthy growth of Internet finance, authorities said.
  
By creating an alternative to state banks, these Internet innovations have been, in essence, prime movers in pushing interest rate reforms endorsed by China's financial authorities.
   
It is expected that new blood from the private capital will also invigorate the banking sector as these five private banks would be small or medium lenders, targeting small businesses that haven't been properly catered for.

NEW CHALLENGES
   
Tuesday's announcement does not come from nowhere. China has taken incremental steps toward interest rate liberalization, such as a move in July to scrap the floor limit for bank lending rates, and a guideline in December for piloting negotiable deposit certificates on the interbank market.
   
Still, these changes have been bold and intense enough to cause worries, and economic pundits have advised caution.
   
Ma Weihua, former president of China Merchants Bank, said interest rate liberalization contains big risks even though it is key to China's financial reform.
   
In the five years after the United States completed its interest rate liberalization, nearly 200 small and medium banks went bankrupt every year, Ma said, adding that Taiwan's banking sector was generally in the red following its interest rate liberalization.
   
Experts have also cautioned that the process, if not handled well, will not only hurt the banks but the real economy as well, citing expectations of a hike in deposit interest rates in the short term, which will likely be translated into higher lending rates by banks to minimize losses.
   
Though the private banks are billed as capable of spurring positive changes, their flexible operations are not risk-free either. 
   
Shang Fulin, head of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, stressed that private banks would be subject to the same supervisory regime as existing commercial banks, with better monitoring of risk and shareholder behavior.
    
Lu Ting, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, proposed that the optimum sequence of reform is to liberalize interest rates for large amounts and long-term saving before turning to small amounts and short-term saving.

Africa needs a paradigm shift in its development plans if it is to catch up with the rest of the world, the head of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) Southern African region said on Tuesday.
   
In remarks delivered at a meeting of experts from the southern African region in Livingstone city, south of Zambia, Said Adejumobi noted that there is no quick fix to development anywhere in the world but that development is a product of concerted efforts and ingenuity.
   
""Africa will have to think differently not only to develop, but also in running to catch up with the rest of the world, the efficient exploitation and management of natural resources will be key to Africa's development and the realization of Vision 2063,"" he said in a statement.

Braving the silence that hung in the air, Yao Yao finally decided to speak. 
   
Yao and eight other volunteers had earlier arrived at the Lido Hotel at noon on Sunday, where anxiety was playing out inside the crowded yet silent place.
   
""I wanted to let them know that even in their most vulnerable state, there were people sharing their deepest fears and despair,"" Yao said.
   
The volunteers were there to provide psychological support to the 100-plus family members of the passengers aboard the missing flight MH370.
   
Contact with the Malaysia Airlines plane was lost along with its radar signal at 1:20 a.m. Beijing time on Saturday as it was flying over the Ho Chi Minh City air traffic control area in Vietnam.
   
The flight was carrying 12 crew members and 227 passengers, including 154 Chinese.
   
Grief-stricken relatives remained silent and anxious, as the fate of their beloved ones was still unknown. Some were lying on the floor, others were huddling against the white walls.
   
Yao is experienced in providing psychological support. She helped relatives of victims in the fatal crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 in 2013.
   
Despite Yao's offer of support, sharing was not easy for relatives.
  
Zhang Zirou, another volunteer, said that the brother and uncle of a passenger spoke to her. ""The tearful brother told me that he was both sad and anxious, but he had to get a hold of himself because he did not want the uncle to crumble."" So Zhang spoke to them separately. 

The volunteers tried to speak to the relatives one by one.
   
For the past two days they have remained with the family members.
   
Yao said some family members were at breaking point due to a lack of information of their loved ones. Some of the relatives were ""preparing for the worst.""
   
""We just listened, so they could express their repressed feelings,"" Yao said.
   
For those who did not want to talk much, Yao and her colleagues simply stood by their side, occasionally offering a cup of water or a tissue.
   
Early on Tuesday morning at Capital International Airport's Terminal 3 in Beijing, the volunteers saw off some of the relatives who left for Kuala Lumpur.
   
Volunteer Chen Xian, with tangled feelings, wrote in his diary, ""I am a member of the volunteer group, but I am also a human being.""
   
""I have parents, brothers, my partner and children, and I know what it feels like for the family members to wait in extreme helplessness with a torn heart every minute of the past few days.""
   
The diary entry continued, ""All I can do is control my emotions, stay by their side, and offer professional support so that they can find a way to let out their anxiety, at least for now.""

The report was released one day before a national tree-planting day on Wednesday, celebrated on March 12 each year.
  
Chinese forestry authorities also beefed up their efforts in ecological restoration and building last year, with the creation of forests totaling nearly 6.1 million hectares, according to the report.

Mystery continued to surround the fate of the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner after Malaysian authorities on Monday ruled out the connection between oil slick off the country's eastern coast and the vanished flight.
   
Based on a lab analysis, samples taken from an oil slick found off Malaysia's eastern coast state of Kelantan are not from the missing jet, Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) eastern region enforcement chief Nasir Adam said late Monday.
      
He added that the oil was a type used by ship, not from an aircraft. 
   
MMEA's search team found an oil slick near Tok Bali, Kelantan state a day later,  but could not confirm whether it came from the missing plane. 
   
The slick, from which the samples were taken, was reportedly detected just south of the spot where the plane lost contact with the ground. 
   
Some objects believed to belong to the ill-fated flight spotted earlier were also dismissed by Malaysian authorities as relevant items.

Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said investigators were looking at ""every angle"" to explain the plane's disappearance, including hijacking.

338109312883186_792919540735492,"Nobel laureate Mo Yan proposes support for bereaved one-child parents 

Chinese Nobel laureate Mo Yan has called for more policy and financial support from the government for parents who have lost their only child.

Speaking at the ongoing annual session of China's top political advisory body, he said the one-child policy that took effect in the late 1970s slowed population growth and eased pressure on resources but caused great difficulties and problems for parents who have lost their only child.

Traditionally, Chinese people rely on their children to support them in old age. When a sole child dies, elderly parents can find themselves in dire circumstances.

In many areas, one-child families get a monthly allowance of a mere 5 yuan (0.8 U.S. dollars) under a policy established in the early 1980s, Mo Yan noted in a proposal submitted to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Those families can only get a total of 840 yuan until their children reach 14, which can hardly cover living costs. Those who have lost their only child face an even worse situation, especially in rural areas, he said.

In Weifang City of east China's Shandong Province, Mo Yan's hometown, there are more than 3,000 people who have lost their only child.

""You can imagine. How can a rural couple in their 60s spend their lonely life?"" the novelist asked.

Mo Yan proposed that parents who have only one child should be included in the government pension and medical insurance system and that financial support to them should be improved.

""When they lose their ability to work, they should enjoy the same wage and treatment as government civil servants,"" he said.

China substantially increased the subsidy for parents who have lost their only child in December last year.

Effective from the start of 2014, couples in cities who have lost their only child and in which the woman is 49 or older get 340 yuan per parent a month. Rural couples get 170 yuan for each parent, according to a statement from the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

Mo Yan, 59, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012. In his novel ""Frog,"" he depicts a rural obstetrician who carried out thousands of abortion operations to strictly implement the one-child policy. 

China has the largest senior population in the world, with 194 million people at or above the age of 60 at the end of 2012, according to the China National Committee on Aging. 

This age group is expected to grow to 243 million by 2020 and by 2050, one-third of the Chinese population will be aged over 60. 

The Ministry of Health said that between the implementation of the one-child policy and the end of 2010, at least 1 million Chinese families had lost their only child, with the figure climbing by 76,000 a year.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/792919540735492/?type=3,2014-03-08 05:42:09,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

A Chinese spaceship plays a key part in Dr. Ryan Stone's thrilling journey back to Earth in the Oscar-winning film ""Gravity.""

In real life, the chief designer of China's spaceships found the film more than merely entertaining; it was ""very inspiring.""

Zhang Bonan, chief designer of the country's spaceship program, told Xinhua on Thursday that he had a professional interest in the movie.

As a national legislator, he is in Beijing attending the ongoing annual parliamentary session, and was happy to discuss how ""Gravity"" both reflects and affects his work in the week in which it won seven Oscars, including the heavyweight Best Director award.

""I am glad a foreign film portrays China's space program,"" he said. ""It is a good promotion of us.

""The parts in the film about China's space station and spaceship are largely fictional. But I got a few ideas from them.""

For instance, it is important to prepare for the threats from space debris, especially on the near-Earth orbit, he said.

In the film, pieces of debris hit a U.S. shuttle and completely change the fate of four astronauts, including the only survivor of the crash, Dr. Stone, played by Sandra Bullock.

Although the film's presentation of the waste matter floating about in space is a bit too dramatic, such accidents might happen if human beings do not keep the near-Earth orbit uncluttered, Zhang said.

Scientists have made efforts in this regard. Carrier rockets are designed to re-enter the atmosphere and burn up after finishing their tasks.

Tiangong-1, China's space lab currently under operation, will have enough fuel to re-enter the atmosphere after its mission ends, according to Zhang.

""This film not only shows us the beauty of space but also the danger. Manned space programs are highly risky,"" he noted.

There are other details in ""Gravity"" that interest the 52-year-old space engineering expert.

In the film, the U.S. astronaut experiences great difficulty in entering China's space station from outside. In reality, that maneuver would be almost impossible.

""I think, when improving design in the future, we should think about how to enable a quicker and easier entry into the space station when there is an emergency,"" Zhang said.

Other Chinese space scientists shared similar opinions about the film.

Liang Xiaohong, Party chief of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, told Xinhua that he liked its imagination and creativity.

""In my list, this is the best ever space film,"" he said.

Ye Peijian, a top scientist with the Chang'e-3 program, the country's lunar probe mission, said he is glad that a space film has proved popular.

""A film like this is an efficient and lovely way to introduce complicated space science to ordinary people,"" Ye believes.

Former NBA star and Chinese icon Yao Ming on Thursday called for the eradication of sales of illegal animal products through legislation and promotion of animal protection awareness among the public.

""Buying ivory is buying bullets,"" Yao, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told reporters on the sidelines of the ongoing annual session of the country's top political advisory body.

China introduced special protection for endangered species, such as panda, golden monkey and white-flag dolphin, in late 1980s, and strictly banned poaching and trading.

Between December 2013 and January 2014, the country led an operation code-named Cobra II against international wildlife crimes, which cracked over 350 cases involving the capture of more than three tonnes of ivory and ivory products, over 1,000 hides and a number of other wildlife products.

The operation was co-organized by China, the United States, South Africa, the Lusaka Agreement Task Force, the ASEAN Wildlife Enforcement Network, and the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network.

In January, the Chinese government destroyed 6.1 tonnes of confiscated ivory it had seized over the years in south China's Guangdong Province.

China's military expenditure will grow by 12 percent to 132 billion U.S. dollars in 2014, the fastest pace in three years.
   
The country's rising military prowess has attracted increasing attention worldwide, with some claiming an ever-growing China could be seeking ""dominance"" that might undermine stability in Asia.
   
Critics of China's defense policies are barking at the wrong tree in their search for the source of regional instability.

The country's military spending is still far from the level it needs to be, as the country faces increasingly severe security challenges. 
   
As military experts have said, China is under mounting strategic pressure. The Asia-Pacific region has become a global geo-political and economic center, with some major powers speeding up strategic adjustments and strengthening military alliances.

Facing rising maritime security tensions, territorial disputes and terrorist threats, China's military expenditure is moderate in scale and in line with the country's economic and security conditions.
   
China's military spending is still dwarfed by that of major world powers, both in terms of its share in GDP and per capita.
   
Although China boasts a territory some 26 times as large as Japan's and a population nine times larger than the latter country, its per-capita spending in national defense represents only about 20 percent of Japan's.

If one is to seriously look for a cause for alarm in Asia, one should fix a gaze on Tokyo, where a nationalistic prime minister has turned his administration into a regional troublemaker.

China has stated repeatedly over the years that the country is on a path of peaceful development and its defense policies are purely defensive in nature. 

Increasing military expenditure by no means implies any change here.
   
It is not good news for world peace and stability if a country as large as China is unable to protect itself, which is the underlying logic for China's growing military spend.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/791262330901213/?type=3,2014-03-05 07:36:46,8,0,2,8,0,0,0,0,0

China plans to raise its defense budget by 12.2 percent to 808.2 billion yuan (about 132 billion U.S. dollars) in 2014, according to a draft budget report submitted to the national legislature for review on Wednesday.

In 2013, the country spent 720.197 billion yuan on national defense, a 10.7-percent increase from the previous year.

Double-digit growth in China's defense budget in recent years has caused concerns from some Western countries. But experts said China's military expenditure is moderate and in line with the country's economic and security conditions. 

Chen Zhou, a researcher with the Academy of Military Sciences and a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said China's current military spending is at a ""reasonable and balanced"" level.

""Compared with major powers in the world, China's spending in national defense is considerably low either in terms of its share in the GDP or in per capita terms,"" he said.

""In order to protect the country and safeguard regional peace and stability, China has to enhance its national defense,"" he said.

Chen acknowledged that China is under increasing strategic pressure, as the Asia-Pacific region has become a global geo-political and economic center, with some major powers ""speeding up strategic adjustments and strengthening military alliance.""

Highlighting rising maritime security risks, territorial and maritime disputes, as well as terrorist threats, Chen said ""the comparatively low level of input into national defense, coupled with a high-risk security environment, dictates that we must raise our defense budget on a moderate scale.""

Chen's words were echoed by Yin Zhuo, director of the Expert Consultation Committee of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, who said China's military spending is still far from the level it needs to be as the country faces increasingly severe security challenges. 

Although the rise in the defense budget in the past three years has surpassed GDP growth, the share of military spending in China's GDP stood at less than 1.5 percent last year, well below the world average of 3 percent, Yin said, citing statistics.

A report released by London's International Institute for Strategic Studies showed the United States remained the world's biggest defense spender in 2013, with a budget of 600.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2013. 

Chen attributed the defense budget increase partly to the increasing international responsibilities China is facing.

China is the largest personnel contributor to UN peace-keeping missions among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It also regularly sends naval task forces to conduct escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia. 

""Overseas missions cost several times more than those within the country,"" Chen said. ""By moderately raising its defense budget and enhancing its military capabilities, China is also capable of making more contributions to world peace.""

Six million old high-emission vehicles will be removed from the roads, and diesel fuel for vehicles that meets fourth-stage national standards will be provided nationwide this year.

The government will also implement the clean water action plan, strengthen the protection of sources of drinking water, prevent and control water pollution in key river basins, and carry out land restoration, according to the report.

Cooperation is the main theme of China's relations with its neighboring countries, she said, adding that China has always advocated peaceful solutions to territorial and maritime disputes with other countries.

""For disputes which cannot be settled in the short term, we could always set them aside, or negotiate joint development plans,"" said Fu, who added that a country's military power should be viewed in terms of its future policy trends.

China's Lunar New Year holiday this year contributed 117 million NZ dollars (98.14 million U.S. dollars) to the New Zealand economy, according to figures from the country's main international port of entry Friday.

""This Chinese New Year saw 34,500 Chinese passengers arrive in New Zealand over the few weeks that make up this important holiday season,"" said Wedlock.

""With the average Chinese travelers spending 3,400 NZ dollars ( 2,852 U.S. dollars) per visit, that means around 117 million NZ dollars were spent during the Chinese New Year.""

The Chinese New Year holiday period, which ran from Jan. 31 to Feb. 14 this year, was a crucial time for both the New Zealand tourism industry and the national economy, but the figures were also a warning against complacency amid growing global competition, he said.

""Already the Seychelles has introduced a visa waiver scheme and Thailand has introduced a visa on-arrival scheme to attract more Chinese travelers,"" said Wedlock.

It is traditionally celebrated by hanging lanterns, playing games and eating sweet rice dumplings, or yuanxiao. But this year, it might also include chocolates and roses. 

The Lantern Festival was especially romantic in ancient China; a day when young women were usually allowed to go outdoors, offering opportunities to meet young men. Many legendary love stories start with an encounter on the Lantern Festival, so some people regard it as the Chinese version of Valentine's Day. 

However, it is not all about romance. Lion and dragon dances, acrobatic performances and fireworks are also features of this special day. Children try to solve puzzles that decorate the colorful lanterns, and are often rewarded with gifts if they get right answers.

Celebrations vary from place to place, but eating yuanxiao is common across the country and has passed down through the generations.

The last time the Lantern Festival coincided with Valentine's Day was in 1995, when many Chinese were still too conservative to discuss love openly. But in the past two decades, attitudes have changed. More Western festivals are becoming popular among young Chinese, and February 14 is a time of roses and chocolates, candlelit dinners and Valentine cards. 

Many people say Valentine's Day in China is too commercial: the price of flowers soars, restaurants are packed, and city center traffic comes to a standstill...It is often remarked that Valentine's Day is about money rather than romance.

However, others plan to marry on Friday, hoping to bask in the good fortune of two festivals, while some worry about how to celebrate the day, to see their family or go out with loved ones? What will the day hold for you?

To find out what's happening in China, check it out on a daily basis with Xinhua.

[Crackdown on sex industry]

China has launched a three-month crackdown on organizers, operators and ""protectors"" of the rampant sex industry in Guangdong Province, where the city of Dongguan is located, often nicknamed as the country's ""capital of sex.""

Prostitution has been outlawed in China for six decades, but the underground business is still rampant in Dongguan, which is also known as one of China's major manufacturing bases. 

Due to footage of a national television revealing sexual services in Dongguan, the city rapidly hit headlines after thousands of police officers swooped on saunas, hotels, massage parlors and karaoke bars suspected of harboring prostitutes.

Dozens of entertainment venues have been closed and 67 people arrested. The high-profile campaign now involves investigating local officials for dereliction of duty and dealing with the ""protective umbrella"" of this illegal but lucrative industry.

As most Chinese came back to work from their weeklong Spring Festival holidays, Dongguan immediately became the hottest topic for domestic media as well as internet users.

The sharply divided reactions however came as a shock to the nation. Many expressed strong sympathy for unprotected sex workers, while sarcastic jokes and comments are being widely reposted.

The hot word ""Dongguan"" was even being implanted into trojan viruses on computers and scam text messages on cellphones.  

""Dad, I have been arrested in Dongguan (for prostitution). I need you to transfer 5,000 yuan to the bank account of officer X. No phone calls. Get me out first!"" says one of such scam text messages. 

It remains rather unclear whether the ongoing crackdown, which is not for the first time in Dongguan, will be eventually effective. 

Follow-up reports already found out that prostitutes were still available in Dongguan but at higher prices.

The more important question concerns the livelihood of all those to-be-laid-off sex workers and the competitiveness of the city without illegal sex business, experts say.

[China slams Japan]

China slammed an application by a Japanese museum to the UNESCO for inclusion of 333 items left behind by WWII kamikaze suicide in the UN organization's Memory of the World Register.

""The application is trying to embellish the invasion history of Japanese militarism and challenge the achievements of the world anti-Fascism war and post-war international order,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

[Ivory-smuggling suspect arrested]

A suspected Chinese ivory smuggler was apprehended in Kenya, making it the first time for China to arrest a wildlife crime suspect overseas.

The suspect, surnamed Xue, was caught in Nairobi by Kenyan authorities and soon extradited to China. Xue is believed to have led an ivory trafficking group in Kenya, and the other two members of the group had been netted in mid January.

338109312883186_771301442897302,"Tesla to spur China's electric vehicle market
by Xinhua writer Fang Dong

   With its racing body, reasonable pricing and ecological concept, Tesla's latest pure electric sports car has caught the eye of motor enthusiasts, industry insiders and environmentalists in China.
   Amid high sales expectations and cautious sizing up by Chinese automakers, there is also hope that the American upstart can bring fresh air to China's stagnant new energy vehicle sector.
   Tesla, a U.S. electric car maker established in 2003, has generated buzz in the United States by building a coast-to-coast network of charging stations for customers to charge their cars quickly during long-distance journeys.
   It sold 18,650 units of the Model S in the U.S. market last year, up 611.8 percent year on year, ranking third in electric car sales, following products from auto giants General Motors and Nissan.
   The company made its debut in China this month with the Model S at a lower-than-expected price of 734,000 yuan (121,300 U.S. dollars), almost the same as in its home country, excluding taxes and transportation costs.
   The move was expected to bring a competitive edge for Tesla to gain a foothold in the world's largest auto market and put pressure on its rivals.
   Zhang Junyi, an auto analyst with Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, said that ""Tesla could be a catfish put into the sardine pool of China,"" stimulating domestic manufacturers to carry out development of their own high-end electric vehicle brands.
   However, Tesla's success on the other side of the Pacific is far removed from the complex competition of the Chinese market, and its high expectations in both sales and influence have yet to be proved in China.
   In 2013, vehicle sales in China totaled 21.98 million units, marking the country's fifth straight year as the world's largest auto market.
   Nevertheless, sales of new energy vehicles stood at just 17,642 units, with sales of pure electric cars even weaker, accounting for less than 0.1 percent of the country's total car sales.
   While the lackluster sales in China indicate a difficult market for Tesla, the figure also suggests the untapped potential of the emerging market and reveals there are few, if any, strong competitors that pose a threat to Tesla.
   ""Actually, no automakers in China consider electric sedans for individual customers a major development strategy, not to mention as luxury cars for high-end buyers,"" said Zhong Shi, an auto industry analyst.
   Jia Xinguang, an industry insider, echoed Zhong's words, pointing out that market demand for electric sedans has remained weak, as few electric auto models in China can satisfy consumers and compete with conventional cars.
   Chinese electric car buyers still face difficulties in finding charging stations when their batteries run low.
   More importantly, according to Jia, price-sensitive Chinese car buyers are more inclined to choose gasoline vehicles that provide a more comfortable driving experience at the same or lower price.
   Chinese companies are therefore reluctant to spend big bucks exploiting the electric sedan market, as even the most popular domestic brands from major producers like BYD Auto, Chery and JAC Motors saw their electric car sales linger around the thousand-unit level.
   Even if homegrown manufacturers change their mind and try to catch up with their peers overseas, their technological reserves and financing mechanisms in China can't support production and promotion of cars like Tesla's, Zhong said.
   ""However, the electrification of public transportation services has proved to be a growth point boosted by government policies,"" Jia said.
   BYD Auto, a Chinese automobile manufacturer based in southeast China's Shenzhen, has seen strong sales of electric buses and taxis, which are easily found in the city of Shenzhen and in the provinces of Shaanxi and Hunan.
   In recent years, the proportion of pure electric coaches in China's bus market has grown quickly. The figure has climbed from 2 percent in 2010 to 9.9 percent in 2012, and is expected to approach 20 percent for 2013.
   As Tesla targets high-end buyers, it is unlikely to be confronted with the harsh market facing Chinese automakers, which focus on inexpensive electric vehicles, since neither the price nor the inconvenience of charging are likely to dissuade wealthier buyers with their own villas and underground garages.
    ""Headwinds will only hit when Tesla starts to expand its business to China's low-end electric sedan market,"" Jia said. However, there are few signs of this happening in the near future.
   China's new energy vehicle sector is just unfolding, and it still requires further policy encouragement, infrastructure and consumer recognition.
   Zhang stressed that the country's electric sedan producers are not yet mature, with a lack of technology and difficulties in application.
   In response, the central government has rolled out an array of measures, ranging from subsidies to facility construction to boost the sector.
   In 2010, China began a pilot program in five cities, including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Hefei and Changchun, to encourage individuals to buy electric sedans with subsidies of up to 60,000 yuan.
   The program was upgraded in the last year with a national promotion project in 28 Chinese cities and city clusters where government subsidies will be provided for users and manufacturers from 2013 to 2015.
   The government expects both sales and production of pure electric and hybrid vehicles to reach 500,000 units by the end of 2015, but it won't be an easy task.

    To support the newly extended family financially, Sheng, now 63, has had to resume work and travels across the country to give lectures, leaving her daughters with two baby sitters. 
    The world's oldest mother, according to the Guinness World Records, was Maria del Carmen Bousada Lara from Spain, who gave birth by cesarean section twin boys at the age of 66 years and 358 days.

Walking towards an exit on the crowded number 96 towards St Kilda, I felt a hand clasp firmly around my left buttock. 

I was instantly repulsed.

This is not the first time a man has felt the right to grab me sexually, uninvited and unwanted, in public or private. In the times before, it scared me so much that I would go into a shame spiral, promising myself never to tell anyone. I remember being groped at age 13 while out with my girlfriends in the city. I didn't even tell them, I was so embarrassed.

The office of the Coroner is an ancient and noble one, pre-dating the arrival of the white man and his Law in Australia by many hundreds of years. Many, many hundreds. 

The role, already established in practise, was formalised by statute in 1194. Over the better part of the millennia that followed the responsibilities and prerogatives of the office have evolved, but always in one direction. Towards the truth.

The Coroner seeks the truth, and although he or she is an officer of the state, no power of the state or any of its interested officials will deny the Coroner's investigations. 

Be it bailiff or sheriff or high minister of the Crown, should the Coroner deem it necessary to summon an official to make explanation, they will be summoned and they will attend or face the dire consequence of their refusal.

It's nothing like dealing with snarky journalists, as Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is about to find out.

The Queensland Coroner has decided that the death of a fit and healthy young Iranian man, asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei, while detained at the behest of Mr Morrison, was no less than a death in custody. 

The Commonwealth had custody and care of Mr Kehazaei and he died from a simple cut to the foot while in that custody. He died in Queensland, having been transferred to hospital here.

Many Australians want to know how and why this appalling tragedy occurred, but only one can compel the man who administered the system in which the victim died to explain himself. The Queensland Coroner.

Perhaps the Coroner will not call Mr Morrison. Perhaps the Coroner will be content with the minister's assurance that a man dying of a cut to his foot is no biggie. It happens all the time, after all. But that is unlikely.

Scott Morrison is more likely about to find himself dragged, metaphorically if not bodily, into a court of law where he cannot lie or even reframe the truth, for that would be perjury and that way lies imprisonment. 

Scott Morrison is about to learn that his power, while seeming absolute when consigning poor bastards like Hamid Kehazaei to oblivion, is nothing like absolute when confronted by the power of the Coroner to seek the truth of that banishment and the death in which it seemingly resulted. 

Scott Morrison, who apparently fancies himself as an alternative prime minister, is about to get a lesson in the realities of power, and maybe, just maybe, a lesson in empathy, when he finds himself subject to the undeniable power of a state official who simply does not care for the unique and personal narrative which makes Morrison, the warm little centre of his own existence.

It is critical that there be a full, credible, and unimpeded international investigation as quickly as possible. We urge all concerned – Russia, the pro-Russian separatists, and Ukraine – to support an immediate cease-fire in order to ensure safe and unfettered access to the crash site for international investigators and in order to facilitate the recovery of remains.

The role of international organizations – such as the United Nations and the OSCE in Ukraine – may be particularly relevant for this effort, and we will be in touch with affected nations and our partners in these organizations in the coming hours and days to determine the best path forward. 

In the meantime, it is vital that no evidence be tampered with in any way and that all potential evidence and remains at the crash site are undisturbed.  The United States remains prepared to contribute immediate assistance to any international investigation, including through resources provided by the NTSB and the FBI. 

While we do not yet have all the facts, we do know that this incident occurred in the context of a crisis in Ukraine that is fueled by Russian support for the separatists, including through arms, materiel, and training.

Melbourne artist Nick Howson saw a blank wall at Richmond Station and thought it was perfect for a mural celebrating the Tigers. Trouble was he couldn't find somebody to give him permission to do it. 

''The people I talked to at Yarra Council and Metro rail were very nice - one at the railways was a Tigers supporter so he was very keen on the idea when I explained what I wanted to paint - but I wasn't getting anywhere.

''They kept saying it was up to the other organisation to give permission, no one seemed to know who the wall belonged to and then, after all those months waiting - when I was told I had to go to the State Rail Authority and they didn't even respond to my phone call - I had had enough.'' 

So he went ahead and did it anyway... full story: http://ow.ly/vUDVy",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theageAustralia/photos/a.131409591421.135734.119817336421/10152307634226422/?type=3,2014-04-17 20:51:43,126,19,14,126,0,0,0,0,0

-- Buses are replacing trains between Oakleigh and Dandenong on the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines due to construction work on the Springvale Road level crossing.

-- The intersection of Victoria Parade and Nicholson Street, East Melbourne, is closed to all traffic and will remain so until April 26, as Yarra Trams replaces 70-year-old tram tracks. The work will also affect tram routes through the area.

-- Regional Rail Link construction west of the CBD will force buses to replace suburban train services on April 26 and 27 on the Werribee line, between Newport and North Melbourne, and the Williamstown line between Williamstown and North Melbourne. Between 19 and 25 April, buses will replace trains on the Sunbury line.

Purple Rain: A hit at Paris' Nuit Blanche, this immersive work gives audience members an umbrella and tosses them into a downpour of eerie light and sound, evoking both the excess and melancholy of the 1980s.

Wonderland: The kaleidoscopic projections that animated the exterior of the Forum Theatre and other Flinders Street buildings may have been the most Instagrammed and Facebooked feature of last year's White Night. Creator The Electric Canvas has been invited back to reinvent the same stretch for 2014's event.

Midden: Situated in Birrarung Marr, this work of 360-degree projection pays homage to the traditional owners of the land and will animate a 150-cubic-metre rock mound, encouraging audiences to interact with the light and soundscape.

Lumieres en Vibration: The 86-year-old artist, Julio Le Parc, has long been a firebrand in the art world - he was expelled from France during the pivotal May 1968 protests, and is a vocal defender of human rights. This new work will transform the Queen Victoria Gardens in Southbank into a seemingly endless maze of light.

Crepuscular Beam: Even if you miss White Night, you might well catch this one - Paul Collison's homage to the twilight will see beams of transforming light thrown far into the night sky above the CBD, with those up close treated to an accompanying soundtrack by Russell Goldsmith.",,status,,2014-02-16 00:05:00,52,6,19,52,0,0,0,0,0

The government says it believes in global warming and the human contribution to it, but everything it has done since it was elected negates that. It's a lie, a wink and a nod, and everybody knows it. This government does not believe in the seriousness of climate change and is abrogating its responsibility to inform Australians about how to adapt and make a fair contribution to global action in our own interests.

What is a citizen's responsibility in these circumstances? Activist Naomi Klein wrote last year about the new ''revolutionary'' scientists who have abandoned their cautious language because governments largely ignored it anyhow. Jason Box, an expert on Greenland's melting ice sheet, was arrested at a rally outside the White House and told Klein that ''just voting didn't seem to be enough in this case. I need to be a citizen also.''

Lord Stern, who reviewed the economics of climate change for the UK government in 2006, now says he ''would have been much fiercer'' in his recommendations if he had known how quickly emissions would rise.

What's likely is that we'll see greater civil disobedience, more protests and blockades, as happened over the past week at Leard State Forest in NSW against the Maules Creek coal mine. Whatever the merits of that protest, for some Australians such action might seem the only thing they can do when an elected government seems content to do so little.

There was a time when you needed to be a convicted felon to get a residence permit to enter Australia on any kind of long-term basis. Being a prison guard was another occupation that would qualify.

There have been countless waves of immigration since the days of transportation, each contributing its own peculiar enrichment to what we know today as our distinctive Australian culture.

When I saw Kevin Rudd on the television and heard him say in that bitter tone words to the effect that refugees who sought sanctuary here by boat would never set foot on Australian soil, but would be banished to a prison camp in a country that had no tradition of dealing with immigrants or refugees, and when no one resigned from the Labor Party in protest, I wanted to go into a state of denial. I didn't want to deal with it, but wanted to go on as I had been, believing in the generosity of this rich country towards those who over the past two centuries have sought refuge here.

I am still trying to go on believing in what was once our genuine acceptance of a common humanity with those in need of our protection and care, a great Australian quality if ever there was one. Somehow, I tell myself, surely there has been a misunderstanding. Surely Australians are still the generous people I once knew. I want to believe we will turn around and admit our mistake and be big enough to offer a gracious apology and go ahead and build centres here in our own country, as we once did for migrants from the Baltic countries and other far-flung places from which they had fled.

David Karoly, Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Melbourne, responds to Maurice Newman, who has made headlines around the world with his claim that Australia ""has become hostage to climate change madness"". Here's the piece http://ow.ly/sc9jn or you can read it below in full.

-----------------
By David Karoly

Maurice Newman is chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council. He must have thought that December 31 was April Fool's Day when he wrote an opinion piece in The Australian headed ""Crowds go cold on climate cost"".

He once again revealed his opinions on climate change science when he wrote ""the scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling"" and ""Australia, too, has become hostage to climate change madness"".

His piece is a mix of common climate change myths, misinformation and ideology. While Mr Newman is welcome to his opinions, his writing reveals his sad misunderstanding of the facts about climate change.

As Upton Sinclair wrote, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!""

Fortunately, the Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt and the Australian government say they accept the science of climate change, as do the Australian Labor Party and the Greens.

The key conclusions on climate change science from the Australian Academy of Science, the Royal Society of London and the US National Academy of Science have been confirmed with even greater confidence by the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in September 2013.

They include:

There is no doubt that the climate system has warmed over the past 100 years and continues to warm.

It is beyond reasonable doubt that human influences, through burning fossil fuels, industrial activity and land clearing, have been the main cause of the observed global warming since the mid 20th century.

Continued emissions of greenhouse gases from human activity will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system.

Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr Newman writes that ""global temperatures have gone nowhere for 17 years"", but the global average surface temperature has warmed over the period 1997 to 2013, ocean heat content has increased significantly, and Arctic sea ice extent has declined, all showing clearly the continued warming of the climate system.

Australia has just set a new record in 2013 for the hottest calendar year temperature averaged across the whole country, unprecedented in more than a hundred years of instrumental observations and outside the range that can be explained by natural variability alone.

He also writes ""when necessary the IPCC resorts to dishonesty and deceit"", but none of the many independent inquiries in the US and the UK into scientists involved in the IPCC have found any evidence to support these claims.

Unlike Mr Newman, leading international energy and economic organisations, such as the International Energy Agency and the World Bank, have accepted the science of climate change and released reports recently on the opportunities for business and industry around the world to transform to a new sustainable, low-carbon economy and away from the old fossil fuel driven economy.

Indeed, Mr Abbott, Mr Hunt and the Australian government have accepted that action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Australia is needed because it is in Australia's national interest as part of global action to minimise dangerous climate change.

I would not choose a person who believes that the Earth is flat to advise Australian shipping or airline businesses on how to plan routes to travel around the world. It is clearly not sensible to have a person who believes that climate change science is a delusion as leader of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council.

Mr Newman has contradicted the Prime Minister and argued against the government's commitments to take action to fight climate change by reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.",,status,,2014-01-01 19:22:46,46,12,12,46,0,0,0,0,0

''Spending millions of dollars on full-page newspaper ads to claim the Papua New Guinea initiative is working – well, there are much more sensible ways to spend that, too.

Earlier Saints captain Nick Riewoldt said Milne should be allowed to play this Saturday. 

He told SEN radio Milne was ""the absolute heart and soul of the football club"".

""He's incredibly resilient. Clearly it's rocked him but he's a very resilient guy,"" Riewoldt said.

""This has been hanging over his head in one way, shape or form for nine years and to do what he's done over that period of time on the field is a credit to him and the support he has had from his family.

""He's a very resilient guy but no doubt he's thinking a lot about it and it's rocked him.""

However, Riewoldt said he understood that Milne's presence in the team could upset people.

""Certainly I understand. This is a difficult time for everyone,"" he said. 

""As a close mate of Milney's obviously we see what he goes through (but) there's other parties involved that it's going to be equally difficult for.

""I understand that some people will disagree (Milne playing) and that's just the nature of people's opinions I guess.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theageAustralia/photos/a.131409591421.135734.119817336421/10151666840176422/?type=3,2013-06-18 23:26:29,10,20,5,10,0,0,0,0,0

Our most-shared story in the past week and well worth a read if you're interested in the future of nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster - this might challenge your perspective on the issue.

Here's the link http://ow.ly/lN6Kz and it's pasted below if you'd prefer to read it here.

---------------
By John Watson

Heard much about Fukushima lately? You know, the disaster that spread deadly contamination across Japan and spelt the end for the nuclear industry.

You should have, because recent authoritative reports have reached a remarkable conclusion about a supposedly ""deadly"" disaster. No one died, nor is likely to die, according to the most comprehensive assessments since the Fukushima nuclear plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.

The accident competed for media space with the deaths of nearly 20,000 people in the magnitude 9.0 quake – 1000 times worse than the Christchurch quake – and tsunami, which wholly or partly destroyed more than a million buildings.

The nuclear workers were the living dead, we were told; hundreds of thousands would die if the plant exploded; even if that didn't happen, affected areas would be uninhabitable and residents' health would suffer for generations.

Instead, two independent international reports conclude that radiative material released from Fukushima's four damaged reactors, three of which melted down, has had negligible health impacts.

In February, the World Health Organisation reported there would be no noticeable increases in cancer rates for the overall population. A third of emergency workers were at some increased risk.

While infants in two localised hot spots were likely to have a 6 per cent relative increase in female breast cancer and 7 per cent relative increase in male leukaemia, WHO cautioned this was a small change. The lifetime risk of thyroid cancer, which is treatable, is only 0.75 per cent, so even in the worst-affected location it rose to only 1.25 per cent.

Now the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation has drawn on 80 scientists from 18 countries to produce a draft report that concludes: ""Radiation exposure following the nuclear accident at Fukushima-Daiichi did not cause any immediate health effects. It is unlikely to be able to attribute any health effects in the future among the general public and the vast majority of workers.""

The committee has had two years to build a fuller picture of radiation dosages (measured as mSv) and impacts. It finds most Japanese in the first and second years were exposed to lower doses from the accident than from natural background radiation's 2-3 mSv a year.

Also, ""No radiation-related deaths or acute effects have been observed among nearly 25,000 workers involved at the accident site. Given the small number of highly exposed workers, it is unlikely that excess cases of thyroid cancer due to radiation exposure would be detectable.""

Those workers, who were allowed a maximum short-term dose of 250 mSv, have been closely monitored. Of 167 exposed to more than the industry's recommended five-year limit of 100 mSv (a CT scan exposes patients to up to 10 mSv), 23 recorded 150-200 mSv, three 200-250 mSv and six up to 678 mSv, still short of the 1000 mSv single dosage that causes radiation sickness, or the accumulated exposure estimated to cause a fatal cancer years later in 5 per cent of people.

So, not even one case of radiation sickness to report.

A swift evacuation of 200,000 residents within a 20-kilometre radius of the plant helped protect them – WHO estimated most residents of Fukushima prefecture received doses of 1-10 mSv in the first year. By August 2011, however, the dose rate at the plant boundary was only 1.7 mSv a year.

The rapid decay of most of the radioactive material (iodine-131, which reduced to a 16th of its original activity in a month) also means the evacuated area has not been permanently blighted. Many residents have returned, although some areas have restricted entry until radiation drops below the 20 mSv-a-year threshold, expected in 2016-17.

Nor has the environment been devastated. The report says: ""The exposures on both marine and terrestrial non-human biota were too low for observable acute effects.""

The quake and tsunami damage is the real catastrophe.
About 1000 deaths have been attributed to evacuations. About 90 per cent were people older than 66, who suffered from the trauma of evacuation and living in shelters. Sadly, those of them who left areas where radiation was no greater than in naturally high background areas would have been better off staying.

Let's be clear, Fukushima was hit by a worst-case scenario: the world's fifth-most-powerful earthquake since 1900, a tsunami twice as high as the plant was built to withstand, and follow-up quakes of magnitudes 7.1 and 6.3. A Japanese commission of inquiry described it as a ""man-made disaster"" because of regulatory failure and lack of a safety culture.

This ""perfect storm"" hit a nuclear plant built to a 50-year-old design and no one died. Japan moved a few metres east during a three-minute quake and the local coastline subsided half a metre, but the 11 reactors operating in four nuclear power plants in the region all shut down automatically. None suffered significant damage. (The tsunami disabled Fukushima's cooling system.)

Yet such is the imbalance of dread to risk on matters nuclear that this accident was enough to turn public opinion and governments against nuclear power. Never mind that coal mining kills almost 6000 people a year, or that populations of coal-mining areas have death rates about 10 per cent higher than non-mining areas, or that coal emissions drive global warming.

And surely the fact that the more modern Onagawa nuclear plant was twice as close to the quake epicentre and shut down as designed, without incident, counts for something.

Japan struggled without 30 per cent of its generating capacity for almost two years before electing pro-nuclear Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in December. About 50 reactors are expected to restart within a year. 

Worldwide, more than 60 plants are being built and 300 are in the licensing process, the strongest growth since the 1970s.

Fukushima was serious, but it was not the end of the debate about nuclear power, nor should it be. And it's hardly an informed debate when the good news about smaller health impacts than anyone dared expect is so widely neglected.

All expectant mothers in Finland receive a cardboard box filled with clothes, bedding, toys and babycare products. 

There's also a tiny mattress that fits into the bottom of the box, turning it into a bed.

The scheme, which began in 1938, is designed to give all children in Finland an equal start in life, and some believe the scheme can be thanked for Finland's ever-dropping infant mortality rate.

Elizabeth Farrelly has been hunting for a car and was shocked at the macho attitudes that prevail http://ow.ly/lwWIE 

""Now that women buy more cars than men, the market should be fully oestrogen-savvy, right?

""Wrong. In every car-yard I've visited (and it's a few) the sales guys are all men. Not just any men either but, with two notable exceptions, car-men. Petrol-heads. You know the type. Men who do not talk easily to women.

""It's not like I can't talk torque, or wattage. And it's not like women aren't there, behind the desk, on the phone, doing the money. But when the tyre-kicking starts, it's all men. Which is weird, given that women can kick and talk at the same time.""

------

Some good comes from the Goodes incident at the 'G. Bad things happen when good people do or say nothing. Swans star Adam Goodes did a good thing in pointing out to security the person, albeit a teenage girl, who had racially abused him, when he could have just let it go with a shake of his head. 

It was good that Goodes took a stand at the start of the indigenous round as it focused the crowd and the thousands watching the game on TV on the fact that we still have some way to go in eradicating racial vilification. 

It was good that we saw how annoyed and distressed Goodes was after the incident, as it showed how hurtful words can be, even to a big, tough star. 

It was good that Eddie McGuire looked so annoyed because he must have felt that his ''Magpie army'' had moved on after 20 years since Nicky Winmar had done such a good thing in proudly showing the Collingwood fans his colour. 

Let's hope we can all have a good time at the footy without stupid, unacceptable racist comments.

Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 48,was one of the first people on the scene after two Islamists butchered a soldier in Woolwich, south-east London. 

She was a passenger on a bus that was travelling past the scene. She jumped off to check the soldier's pulse.

""Being a cub leader I have my first aid,"" she said. ""So when I saw this guy on the floor I thought it was an accident. Then I saw the guy was dead and I could not feel any pulse.

""And then when I went up there was this black guy with a revolver and a kitchen knife.

""He had what looked like butcher's tools and he had a little axe, to cut the bones, and two large knives and he said: 'Move off the body.' So I thought: 'OK, I don't know what is going on here.' He was covered with blood. I thought I had better start talking to him before he starts attacking somebody else. 

""I thought these people usually have a message so I said: 'What do you want?'

""I asked him if he did it and he said 'yes', and I said 'why?' And he said because he [the victim] has killed Muslim people in Muslim countries.

""I said: 'Right, now it is only you versus many people, you are going to lose, what would you like to do?' He said: 'I would like to stay and fight.' ""

119817336421_10151574756666422,"""Your industry is a painfully poisonous parasite on Australia's arse""... Peter Fitzsimons has a personal message tonight for bookmaker Tom Waterhouse that's worth a read, here's the link and the full piece is below: http://ow.ly/kn5np 

Bring it in tight, Tom Waterhouse. Yes, yes, yes, it is me again, and no, I don't have particularly hard feelings because you're suing me for defamation at the moment. Nothing personal, what?

Nevertheless, because of that legal action, I have of course tried to temper my remarks when it comes to your statement to the joint select committee on gambling reform on Tuesday, where you robustly defended your ubiquitous presence on sports broadcasts across Australia, asserting your right to flog your sports betting operation as you please.

So let me, as delicately as I can muster, as carefully as possible, choose my words delicately . . . with malice towards none . . . with charity to all:

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FREAKING MIND?!

If you wrote the statement to the select committee, give yourself an uppercut. If someone wrote it for you, pretend you're Mark Bouris on Celebrity Apprentice and say loudly: ""You're fired.""

In that statement, you say you have, ""No intention of targeting children through our advertising . . .""

What are the kids then? Collateral damage? Whether or not the kids are specifically ""targeted"" by your company is hardly the point? The point is that they ARE hit, regardless. The point is that while the government has the brains to have a ban on gambling advertising on programs children are likely to be watching, there remains the ludicrous exception of sport, which millions of Australian kids watch for hours on end!

The point is that because of this exposure gambling chat in the playground is now endemic, and many young Australians think that gambling is glamorous instead of the brain-dead loser pursuit it actually is. So you didn't specifically target them? So what?

The outcome is equally devastating – a time-bomb that will go off when they have more than their lunch money to lose.

You also said: ""In the first two rounds we presented at some times alongside Nine commentators but not as a commentator rather as a broadcast sponsor . . .""

Really? Why then did you have the same Channel Nine microphone as Kenny, Sterlo, Phil Gould et al? Why then did your mother, the redoubtable Gai Waterhouse, defend your capacity as a commentator, saying you had followed sport all your life? And what do you mean ""we""? Unless you are one of quintuplets, you, specifically, seem to be everywhere!

And so from the third round you went to ""discrete segments""? In response, I am trying to think of the apposite word. Oh, I remember: Bullshit! Can't you see that you really are gambling's answer to ""Eddie Everywhere"", that you have become ""Tommy Totally Too Much"", that every time we turn on the tube to watch sport, there you are spruiking us on new ways to do our dough? Even then, you were only getting warmed up.

""This type of arrangement by our company, and others,"" you said, ""in this and other industries is vital in keeping TV a viable and relevant medium to promote business"".

There's that word again. Bullshit! To begin with, TV has gone fine for 60 years without gambling advertising to speak of, and secondly, your ""industry"" has only one ultimate wide-ranging product: impoverished Australians.

Seriously, think about it. What else do you produce in bulk, but impoverished Australians? Go on, write the angry letter, add to the writ, but I challenge you to give an answer to that question: What else do you produce in bulk, but impoverished Australians?

This is the industry you want the government to protect? Why would they? Why do they? (I'll leave you to answer that, Senator Conroy. How bloody hard can it be to shut down the exception, particularly when the vast majority of Australians want exactly that to happen?)

But go on, Tom Waterhouse, please do. ""For TV to be able to afford broadcast rights, the funding of which is ploughed back into the sport,"" you say, ""it needs to stay relevant to advertisers. In the modern age traditional advertising (commercial ad breaks) no longer always works effectively.""

Too good! Umm, if the broadcasters can't afford the broadcast rights, who will be able to afford them – the non-broadcasters? Perhaps BHP could buy them, and put out the games as smoke signals from Port Kembla? No, on reflection, I think one way or another the broadcast rights will only stay with true broadcasters.

In sum, your submission is a joke, your industry is a painfully poisonous parasite on Australia's arse, and I will, I daresay, see you in court.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theageAustralia/photos/a.131409591421.135734.119817336421/10151574756666422/?type=3,2013-04-23 13:34:00,305,49,183,305,0,0,0,0,0

Don't drag the ball beneath you.

Don't drop or lose the ball, or dispose of it by any means other than kick or handball – but don't hold on to it, either. Don't screen or block. 
Don't trespass into the danger area, but if caught there, don't raise your arms as if innocent. 
Don't deliberately send the ball out of bounds, but (this from the coaches) don't turn it inboard, either.

There was an audible intake of breath at the press conference as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow, believed to be from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razor-sharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos, mounted on a wooden pole, which was swung at Richard at very close range.

You guessed it – Melbourne, which is now one of the priciest cities in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit: http://ow.ly/hnYZi 

Melbourne rose four places to fifth spot on the cost of living index, behind Tokyo (1st), Osaka (2nd), Sydney (3rd) and Oslo (4th). Amazingly it's now more expensive than Zurich, Geneva and Paris. So is it worth it?

Award-winning reporters Nick McKenzie and Richard Baker have been subpoenaed to give evidence in a case against former banknote officials, who are accused of bribery. 

They are expected to be asked to reveal the source of a December 8 report that an alleged bagman from Indonesia would testify against the seven accused as a star witness for the prosecution. 

Age editor-in-chief Andrew Holden said even though McKenzie and Baker were risking jail by not divulging their sources, they would not do so.

""They won't reveal confidential sources. We don't do that,"" he said.

The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has organised the rally to support the journalists, who, as union members, are obliged to respect their source's anonymity. Victoria recently introduced shield laws for journalists, to prevent them from being forced to reveal confidential sources, but the case began before the laws came into effect.

YOU'D have to say it's a theme in the culture - the outrageous mistreatment of girls at Sydney University's St John's College, which almost took the life of a student there this year. The scandal that shook the Australian Defence Force Academy over sexual violations present and past, and similar problems right across the defence forces. And of course the recurring sagas involving sportsmen's behaviour towards women.

We are only just coming to grips with our tendency to create generations of defective men. That this happens in places that are the incubators of our nation's political, legal and business leaders, means it couldn't be more urgent.

Schools and university colleges have long claimed to be about making honourable men. The now laughably pompous-sounding name ''Johnsmen'' for the Sydney college's former residents must have had its origins in some ideal of masculinity. It doesn't square with images of students collecting their own faeces to leave lying in corridors, or setting fire to furniture, let alone violating vulnerable students. What is most concerning is that the adults in charge were for so long unwilling to intervene.

2. Put the day to bed before you go to bed - think about work, problems etc early in the evening, not when you're trying to sleep.

1419943011629069_1426366424320061,"The National, Scotland's new daily newspaper, was launched on 24 November 2014 in response to the strong vote for Scottish independence in the referendum two months earlier. 

We are the only daily newspaper in Scotland to support independence for the country and in the aftermath of the referendum its main role is to hold the Westminster parties to the promises they made of significant new powers for the Scottish parliament. The National also campaigns against poverty and for greater social justice in Scotland, with a strong international focus and regular sporting and cultural profiles. 

Public response has been outstanding.  Our launch day print run of 60,000 virtually sold out and we are now outselling many long-established daily newspapers and have thousands of daily digital subscriptions.

We want to thank everyone who has purchased and supported The National in our first few weeks - and the 4,000+ people who took the time to complete a pretty detailed survey to help inform us as to who is buying the paper and what you/they want from their new daily read.  The initial results have been fascinating and we are now using all of this information to help refine and further develop The National, in print and online, to keep on building on our initial success and make 2015 even more successful.

Apart from Christmas Day, Boxing day, New Year's day and 2nd January, we'll be publishing every Monday to Friday in print and online into 2015 (and beyond).

Thanks again and keep on buying, reading and supporting The National.  It's your new newspaper for Scotland.",,status,,2014-12-19 07:50:58,594,52,97,594,0,0,0,0,0

1419943011629069_1423207194635984,"We said it was a bold ... some said crazy... move: Launch a newspaper in little more than three weeks from idea to reality; trust the public to support it because of a shared political dream; test public reaction and give it a week to prove itself. It may have been crazy but it seems to be working.

We hope we have lived up to the aspirations of our readers, and that we continue to do so in the weeks and months ahead. We are the first to admit that our first steps in this world have not been perfect, but we believe that we have established a blueprint for an engaging and passionate newspaper.

Over to you, this is your chance to let us know what you think of Scotland's newest daily newspaper.

What are we doing right and what would you like to see more of? Your opinion is crucial to our continued success, so we have put together a short survey to gauge reaction and to find out a little bit more about our readers.

It should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete and we will randomly select 5 winners to receive a token of our thanks. 

To take the survey, go to 'www.thenational.scot' & click 'Take Our Survey'.

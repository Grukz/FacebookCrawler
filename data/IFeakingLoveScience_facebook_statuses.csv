We're live from a bat rescue in Michigan. These are actual vampire bats, and you're watching them live. Did you think bats were terrifying creatures? Wrong. They actually save us billions of dollars every year in pesticides, thanks to all the delicious insects they eat. A single bat will eat its entire body weight in insects every single night. They're also natural pollinators and spread seeds far around. Bats have also helped human technologically - we've improved flight and radar systems by studying their incredible abilities.

They're not scary or harmful at all - they're interesting, helpful creatures that are in big need of our help. Bat populations are declining dramatically world wide, and it's hard to convince people they need saving if they're afraid of them!

• Mary Anning was a British fossil collector and paleontologist. 

• Ada Lovelace is considered to be the world's first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's analytical engine. 

• Marie Curie was the first person honored with two Nobel Prizes in both physics and chemistry. Her achievements included a theory of radioactivity, techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium.

• Lise Meitner was part of the team that discovered nuclear fission, for which her colleague Otto Hahn was awarded the Nobel Prize. In 1997, element 109 was named meitnerium in her honor.

• Emmy Noether, was a mathematician known for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. She was described by Albert Einstein as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.

• Cecelia Payne was a British astronomer and astrophysicist. She was the first person to discover that the universe is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. 

• Barbara McClintock produced groundbreaking research in cytogenetics and demonstrated that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off.

Where did we come from? Are we alone? Join guest host Bill Nye the Science Guy, comic co-host Eugene Mirman and their special guests comedian Dave Foley and Seth Shostak, Senior Astronomer at the SETI Institute, as they attempt to answer these questions on stage at the Marine Memorial Theater in San Francisco earlier this year. You'll learn about the different approaches we take to the search for extra terrestrial intelligence. Find out about Frank Drake, the pioneering astronomer whose work has helped define SETI. Ponder what form alien life might take, and what might happen if we ever found proof of that life, from government actions to the public response.

At the time, he was working with the the largest Soviet particle accelerator at that time, the U-70 synchrotron. He was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment when safety protocols failed, and he managed to accidentally stick his head in the path of the proton beam. According to his own report, he felt no pain but saw a flash brighter than a thousand suns.

After the accident, the left half of his face swelled up and the skin began to peel. Having received a huge dose of radiation, he was not expected to survive. However, he made a full recovery and even completed his PhD. He is still alive today, and the only long term side effects seem to be deafness in his left ear, increased fatigue, occasional complex partial seizures and rare tonic-clonic seizures.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience/photos/a.456449604376056.98921.367116489976035/868964229791256/?type=3,2014-07-02 08:00:00,118432,5963,19328,118432,0,0,0,0,0

367116489976035_855575357796810,"The mouth and esophagus of the leatherback turtle are a perfect example of how an animal can become adapted to its diet and habitat. When the turtle consumes jellyfish (and it must eat many, as jellyfish have low nutritional value), the esophagus stores both the jellyfish and the seawater that have been swallowed. However, to prevent the stomach filling with water, the seawater must be expelled. So how does this happen?

The answer lies in the backwards-pointing spikes you see in the mouth of the turtle, which continue down the esophagus and grow progressively larger. As the muscles of the esophagus squeeze the seawater out, the spines keep the jellyfish in place. Once all the water has been expelled the jellyfish are then passed into the stomach. This strange adaptation is one of many that have kept this magnificent species in existence for 90 million years.

Reporting on Science (Part 1)

When it comes to science journalism, there are few reporters with as much experience as Miles O'Brien. In Part 1 of their interview, Neil, Miles and comic co-host Chuck Nice discuss the business of science news. You'll find out why CNN started a science division - and why they shut it down. Miles discusses the impact of ""The Foxification of News"" and journalists who make themselves the center of the story. He describes his journey from history major to science reporter, including an interview with CNN's president who told him, ""You don't know sh*t about science."" You'll also hear about Miles' most memorable stories: reporting on the Columbia space shuttle disaster and covering John Glenn's return to space with ""co-anchor"" Walter Cronkite.

In dire situations the lizard will fill its sinuses with blood until they explode, causing an aimed stream of blood to shoot up to 5 feet from the corner of its eyes. The blood also contains chemicals that are foul-tasting to canines. It looks painful and harsh, but they recover from it almost immediately and get on with their daily lives.

Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with astrophysicist Dr. Steven Soter, co-writer of the new COSMOS series on FOX and the original hosted by Carl Sagan. 

They discuss making the show, from the challenges of creating for broadcast TV (commercials!) to the response to the show from creationists and others. Steven describes working with Carl and Ann Druyan, the surprising derivation of the phrase ""billions and billions"" and what Carl originally wanted the show's final episode to be, instead of nuclear war and the survival of humanity. You'll find out how they choose which science to include, why there's so much history in the series, and why they use animation to illustrate it.

On this day in 1970, Apollo 13 safely returned to Earth after disaster struck the mission. 

About 56 hours after launching, an oxygen tank exploded in the command module and critically damaged it. This not only canceled the planned moon landing, it threatened the lives of the astronauts. They evacuated into the lunar module, which was not equipped to be used as a lifeboat. The LM was designed for 45 hours of use, but the crew would require about 90.

Desperate times called for desperate measures, and the crew had to improvise the module's CO2 removal system. To conserve water, the crew only took in about a fifth of what they needed; about 6 ounces per day. The inadequate batteries were preserved by shutting off all non-essential functions on the LM, including heat. 

On top of everything else, the crew had to correct their trajectory from a lunar landing to a free-return course, which the LM was not designed to do. Commander James Lovell used the position of the sun to aid in his calculations and fired the LM's burners to successfully alter their course.

After days of being cold, exhausted, and dehydrated, the crew safely splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience/photos/a.456449604376056.98921.367116489976035/796350487052631/?type=3,2014-04-17 20:05:01,79867,2082,10123,79867,0,0,0,0,0

The top image shows what a 3-light-year-long portion of the nebula looks like in visible light. With this view, it is easy to see the wispy dust being pushed away because of the high speed wind and radiation.

The lower picture was taken in infrared. Infrared radiation is able to cut through the dust better than visible light, which is why the stars show up more clearly. While the nebula itself is less visible, it is easy to see the new star forming in the middle.

""Sure, we all engage in a little self satisfaction now and then. It's perfectly natural, and there are many biologically relevant hypotheses to explain it. Recent work on Rhesus macaques has revealed that male RANK has a lot to do with incidence of masturbation - but there's a wacky (pun intended) twist on the story that you won't believe!!""

The Hubble has a tracking system that it uses to account for gyroscopic drift while taking images. It locks onto a guide star and uses that to compensate for the motion. According to the ESA: ""It is suspected that in this case, Hubble had locked onto a bad guide star, potentially a double star or binary. This caused an error in the tracking system, resulting in this remarkable picture of brightly coloured stellar streaks. The prominent red streaks are from stars in the globular cluster NGC 288. It seems that even when Hubble makes a mistake, it can still kick-start our imagination.""

This altered the Earth's moment of inertia changed ever so slightly, causing the rotation to move more slowly. This is the same principle behind why figure skaters tuck in their arms to spin faster.

NASA has calculated that the dam only slows the rotation by 0.06 microseconds, which is six hundredths of a millionth of a second. Our planet's rotation speed actually fluctuates fairly often, as it can be influenced by earthquakes, the moon, and the climate change-induced movement of the North Pole.

Though it seems hard to imagine now, in 1952 there were over 58,000 cases of polio in the United States. Over 21,000 of those cases resulted in paralysis or deformity and over 3,000 resulted in death. Though the vaccine was approved in 1955, it became widely available in 1956. As a result, the total number of cases in 1957 dropped to 5,500. A decade later, only 41 total cases were reported. Polio was declared to be officially eradicated in the US in 1979. 

There has been a successful massive push to spread polio vaccinations and eradicate the disease worldwide that has brought the global number of polio cases down by 99%. However, due to a lack of support from the government and community leaders, the vaccine has not been widely administered and remains endemic in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Infants all over the world still need to be vaccinated until the risk has gone away completely, as travelers to those regions can still spread the disease.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience/photos/a.456449604376056.98921.367116489976035/783862341634779/?type=3,2014-03-26 22:00:01,82783,1636,18300,82783,0,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, a new report has concluded these beautiful tiny little guys—and 30 other species just like it in the Plectostoma genus— are on the verge of extinction. The report also describes 10 new species of these snails, though one of them (P. tenggekensis) is not expected to last until the end of the year.

The snails feed on the vegetation that grows on the coastal limestone. Unfortunately, miners retrieving the stone that will end up being used as cement are causing irreparable habitat destruction.

The bananas available at your grocery store have been designed to be seedless for added convenience, though it does leave the plant unable to reproduce in the wild.

367116489976035_772452316109115,"The immune system essentially sees things in one of two ways: ""self"" which is part of the body and shouldn't be attacked, and ""non-self"" which is typically a foreign contaminant that needs to be dealt with. When cells become pre-cancerous, the immune system no longer sees them as being part of the self and eliminates them.

Of course, the immune system isn't perfect and doesn't get rid of all pre-cancerous cells, probably because those cells might not seem different enough to attack. Or, the immune system might recognize the threat but isn't strong enough to do anything about it. Researchers are now figuring out how to bolster the immune system so it becomes better equipped to recognize and handle the threat.

When they drop their tails to escape predators they will return to the scene to eat the tail and regain the nutrients if the predator has considered it too small a morsel to bother with. Other lizards will eat the tails of rivals they have bested in battle. Two species of African spiny mice are the only mammals known to be able to regrow dropped tails.

It will be slightly too faint to be seen with the naked eye, but can be easily spotted with a set of binoculars or a smaller telescope.

The best time to view will be right around midnight. It will appear to be moving through the constellation Hydra. Alphard is the brightest star in the constellation, and Upsilon1 Hydrae will be slightly down and to the left of it. Using these two stars, you should be able to spot Pallas. If you aren't sure that you found the right thing, just wait. Pallas will be the only thing that will have moved relatively far in a couple of hours.

Nicolaus Copernicus was born on this day in 1473. Among many things, Copernicus was an astronomer who is known for his support of the theory that the Earth revolved around the Sun, and not the other way around. However, he did not publish his ideas until he was very near death, fearing backlash from those who strongly felt the Earth was the center of the Universe. This fear was probably justified, as supporting Copernicus' heliocentric theory resulted in Galileo Galilei's heresy conviction 160 years later in 1633.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience/photos/a.456449604376056.98921.367116489976035/762684873752526/?type=3,2014-02-19 15:00:01,35366,719,9514,35366,0,0,0,0,0

Venus is suspected to be a chimera, which is when two zygotes fuse into one, leaving the animal with two sets of genetic information. Essentially, she would be her own twin!

Others aren't so sure that she is really a chimera and think that she could display mosaicism, which arises when genetic recombination results in different genotypes in a single organism's tissues.

Venus was born as a stray on a dairy farm in 2009 but now she lives a comfortable life in a good home. She's still doing quite well and is in good health.

Since the 1980s, poachers have managed to get to the rhinos and nearly bring them to extinction, despite it being protected land. The guards are outnumbered and outgunned in many cases.Poachers seek out the rhinos solely for their horns, due to superstitious beliefs that they hold healing properties. 

There are only four Northern white rhinos remaining in the wild and the Southern white rhino has been in drastic decline. In fact, poaching of the Southern white hit an all-time high in 2013. Currently, conservation officials are desperate to mate the remaining rhinos in hopes of saving the species.

This was to be the first mission of the Apollo program, dedicated to performing manned lunar missions. Apollo 1's mission was to occupy low Earth orbit for up to 14 days and would test launching operations of the newly-designed spacecraft. The mission had a planned launch date of February 21, 1967.

Unfortunately on January 27, 1967, a simulation which would test if the spacecraft could run solely on internal power ended in disaster. Despite the fact that there was no fuel in the craft, a fire broke out in the cockpit. From the first report of fire in the cockpit, it took only seventeen seconds for the crew to be completely consumed by the flames, resulting in the death of all three astronauts. Investigations would reveal that several factors came together to cause this disaster.

One of the most common explanations is that when the bubble collapses, the air inside gets pressurized. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases the temperature of the gas. During sonoluminescence, the temperature inside the tiny bubbles becomes so great that the gas begins to glow.

Another hypothesis is that the collapsing bubble lends energy to prolong the life of the otherwise quickly annihilating photons that are spontaneously generated in a vacuum. Sonoluminescence could also be the product of the way photons can pop into and out of existence; the sudden collapse of the bubble making the photons noticeable to those in the macro world.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience/photos/a.456449604376056.98921.367116489976035/747500401937640/?type=3,2014-01-27 00:00:00,82868,2663,28307,82868,0,0,0,0,0

In order to survive the night hummingbirds must enter into a hibernation like state called torpor, when the metabolism is significantly reduced. Their heart rate slows and their body temperature goes from 104 F to a mere 54 F.

Rather than sound bouncing off the walls, ceiling, and floor like a traditional room, the sound is absorbed.

Unsurprisingly, it was discovered that out of 13,950 peer reviewed articles published between 1 January 1991 and 12 November 2012, only 24 rejected the notion that the climate was changing and that humans were the main driver.

Has this trend continued? Of course.

A follow on study has applied the same methodology this time focusing on peer reviewed articles published between November 12th, 2012 and December 31st, 2013. The researchers found 2,258 articles, written by a total of 9,136 authors- Of all the articles, only one solitary article, written by a single author, rejected anthropogenic climate change.

If 9,136 oncologists told you that you had cancer and one oncologist said you did not, ask yourself: would you take a chance on that one Doctor and refuse treatment?

Over the course of his life, Wallace penned 22 books and 747 shorter works; over 500 of which were scientific papers on topics such as evolution, biogeography, and anthropology.

Whales are some of the largest creatures ever to appear on Earth, so when they wash ashore after death it's no small task to remove the carcass. Because of the incredible size the whale must be cut into smaller and more manageable pieces. The act of cutting it up poses yet another obstacle: dead whales can explode when punctured.

As the mother gives birth, the baby comes out tail first so the baby does not drown. As soon as the baby's head is clear of the birth canal, it heads straight to the surface for its first breath. Young bottlenose dolphins nurse for the first 18 months of their lives, but can remain with their mothers for about 6 years to learn how to hunt.

Mothers giving birth will usually stray from the pod to have the baby alone, but sometimes another female might be present to act like a midwife and help out. This is usually the only other dolphin the mother will allow to be near her calf.

The mice are not impervious to pain, but have evolved pain resistance to bark scorpion venom. Researchers studying the mice hope this resistance may prove useful for engineering a new class of painkillers for humans.

Two papers that were published this week put the debate to rest, showing that RNAi does indeed fight viruses in mammals.

This remained a mystery in mammals for so long in part because mammals have other antiviral processes like interferons, many viruses are able to evade RNAi, and researchers may have previously been looking in the wrong place.

367116489976035_679546865399661,"The ""magic number"" is a quantity of protons or neutrons that makes an atomic nucleus unusually stable. Protons and neutrons fill up separate shells inside nuclei and each shell can accommodate only a certain number of particles. A nucleus holds a 'magic number' of protons or neutrons when the particles completely fill the shells without any room left for adding more. This renders the nucleus more stable and longer-lived than other nuclei. 

Researchers smashed beams of nuclei together at high speeds and discovered that calcium-54, which has 20 protons and 34 neutrons in its nucleus is stable – for a few milliseconds. This isotope is a radioactive variant of calcium and is not regularly found in nature. The new magic number could help scientists understand how atomic nuclei are formed in stars.

The 3D printer, which will be about the size of a toaster, faced several challenges. Existing 3D printers made for use on Earth do not need to worry about the lack of gravity, vibrations, pressure and temperature fluctuations, and limited power supply that exist in space. This new printer addresses all of these and will allow astronauts to custom build parts as needed.

Instead of sending up individual parts, spools of plastic can be sent instead saving space and minimizing waste.

The birds on this island take to the sea to find food. Increasingly often, however, they find plastic instead. It's small, brightly colored, and in the water, so the albatross snatch it up and swallow it. They feed it to their babies. They ultimately die due to a lack of food. It is estimated that 40% of all chicks will die due to eating this plastic.

The new research is based upon the chemical composition of three-billion-year-old soils from South Africa, which showed evidence for low concentrations of atmospheric oxygen. This oxygen production would create the foundation for photosynthesis, and allow oxygen breathing organisms to evolve and inhabit the planet.

367116489976035_670773602943654,"About 10,000 years ago, during the Neolithic, different world populations developed domestication of plants and animals and began switching from a hunter-gatherer nomadic lifestyle to one that was more sedentary. The worldwide human population exploded from around 4-6 million people to 60-70 million by 4,000 B.C.E. New research using mitochondrial DNA of individuals from 66 African and Eurasian populations has challenged this model, comparing the genetic results with archaeological findings. The researchers concluded that the first significant expansion of human populations seems to date back to the Palaeolithic (60,000-80,000 years ago) rather than Neolithic age. Palaeolithic human population expansion may be the result of more advanced hunting techniques or rapid environmental change.

367116489976035_669391713081843,"The various announcements about the potential for water on Mars over the past few months were presented together recently at the European Planetary Science Congress, providing compelling evidence Mars was wet in the past. The evidence comes from data from the Mars rover Curiosity, which has been exploring Mars since its touchdown in Gale Crater in August 2012.

Rocks studied by Curiosity showed water had flowed through their fractures and left calcium sulphate behind as veins. Clay minerals were found inside a mudstone Curiosity drilled into, indicating the rock was either formed in non-acidic water or altered by it. Mudstones form where very fine grains settle out in calm water - in lakes, lagoons, or the deep sea. Researchers think the Mars' mudstone may have formed in a lake, and could have been an ideal location for microbial life. Other rocks on Mars have also hinted at the presence of hydrated minerals. Conglomerates, which are evidence of ancient river deposits, have also been found on Mars' surface, some with evidence of cross-stratification. The small pebbles within these conglomerates are too large to be transported by wind.

The research team were unable to detect ancient DNA in sub-fossilised insects in copal that were 60 years to 10,600 years old, even though they were using sensitive next generation methods. This suggests that potential DNA survival in resin inclusions is not going to be better, and in fact may be worse, than that in air-dried museum whose DNA was retrieved using similar techniques. Early successes in the 1990's extracting DNA from ambers up to 130 million years old proved false when a study at the Natural History Museum, London, was unable to replicate the process.

The Science of Sex comes to its inevitable climax this week. From the start, when Neil deGrasse Tyson and sex therapist Dr. Ruth discuss whether size matters in planets and penises, to the finish, when the pair discuss aliens and sex under the stars, you're in for a satisfying experience. Where else would two astrophysicists, Neil and Charles Liu, discuss arousal in terms of pupil dilation and norepinephrine release, and ejaculation in terms of sperm volume and velocity, in the same episode that Kristen Schaal goes bananas over sex-crazed bonobos? Plus, Mary Roach describes how she and her husband ""took one for the readers"" by becoming the first couple to have sex recorded with 4-D ultrasound imaging, and tells us who has better sex and why according to Masters and Johnson.

Sharks typically breed when they are older, have long gestation times, and only give birth a couple of times in their life.

Balloons that have not been properly inflated will not pop and just slowly deflate over the course of a few days or weeks. The latex bits are often ingested by wild animals and can get lodged in their throats, or they won't be able to digest them. Ribbons that are attached to the balloons can entangle animals.

Latex balloons are biodegradable, but the process takes around 6 months on land, and about 12 months in the water.

If dark matter is the longest unsolved problem in astrophysics, how can Neil deGrasse Tyson answer your Cosmic Queries this week? Well, it turns out we do know something about the stuff that makes up 96% of our universe. For instance, how it affects the rotation of galaxies, and what would happen if it disappeared. And whether dark matter is increasing as the universe expands. You'll find out if there are connections between black holes and dark matter and what Hawking Radiation is. Did the recent experiments on the ISS explain why dark matter doesn't interact with ordinary matter? Plus, Neil tells comic co-host Leighann Lord why he thinks dark energy should be named Fred.

They can't force themselves to undergo the changes necessary for survival in a changing climate, and some animals lack the required genetic diversity altogether. This study examined over 500 different species in 17 different groups of animals.

367116489976035_634255593262122,"This week on StarTalk radio: The Science of Hip Hop with GZA (part 1)

If you think rap music is just about violence, then you're about to have your expectations shattered. Columbia Asst. Professor of Science Education and hip hop culture expert Dr. Christopher Emdin joins Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice to explain how he uses rap to teach inner city youth about science. But the soul of the episode comes from Neil's interview with rapper GZA from the Wu-Tang Clan. They explore science as a creative muse, and GZA talks about the difference between how he thinks of his music and how fans relate to albums like Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). GZA talks about growing up in the hood and how violence often is a choice. Part 1 ends with Neil and GZA spitting a cosmic verse together, leaving us hanging for Part 2 next week.

On Feb. 7, 2013, the night before the Blizzard of 2013 (aka Winter Storm Nemo), astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Eugene Mirman stopped by The Bell House in Brooklyn NY to talk about the weather. Dr. Adam Sobel, professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University, was on hand to help us understand what causes hurricanes, from the Coriolis force and the jet stream to asymmetrical temperatures and tides. Together with comedian Michael Showalter and musician Questlove from The Roots (the in-house band for Late Night with Jimmy Fallon), the StarTalk Live crew toured the most infamous storms of our century, including the great Galveston Hurricane, the Perfect Storm (Hurricane Grace), Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Katrina and of course, Superstorm Sandy. They also discussed the science of weather forecasting, the categories on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and whether we could – or should – redirect a hurricane.

At first glance, this might sound like an excruciating way to tear up your body all weekend, but results from a study showed that participants were taxing their bodies up to 30% less at the 200 mile mark than at the 100. Exhaustion plays a big role in this. Participants that went the full distance were about 4 minutes per mile slower than their counterparts who did half the distance. It appears that ""slow and steady"" really does have advantages in a race setting.

From vanilla to barbecue to fruit loops, many male butterflies have a distinct smell, known to scientists as pheromones, used to attract females. These pheromones are produced in specialized scales on the wings and are often wafted over females during courtship by flapping. The smells are often oddly familiar to humans, and Opsiphanes butterflies (as seen here) can leave you desiring a piece of cake after catching one in the Amazon.

So, next time you see a butterfly- try getting close enough to sniff it.

When the two got stuck for the fourth time, the rescuers had to discuss possibly euthanizing them to prevent the slow, painful death that would accompany being beached.

The slugs are thought to be a relic from when the area was surrounded by rainforest 17 million years ago. Volcanic activity in the area created arid conditions that caused the rainforest to recede. High elevation protected the small ecosystem from the effects of the volcano, leaving it isolated. Scientists believe this isolation has been crucial to their survival.

About 50 years ago, Japanese macaques watched humans bathing in a hot spring near an inn in the mountains. The monkeys decided to get out of the cold too, and eventually joined the humans. The monkeys, not being well potty-trained, started using the bathroom while soaking, much to the displeasure of the hotel guests. A new monkey-only pool was constructed, but in winter months when the hot water is in high demand, some of the macaques will come down and bathe with the people again.

In addition to being a source of heat, the hot springs have turned into social sites. The macaques spend a great deal of time relaxing, socializing, and grooming one another. However, the alphas decide who can come in and who can sit out and watch in the snow.

As cubs a lion, a tiger, and a bear had been owned by a drug dealer who did not properly care for them. The bear's harness grew into his skin because the owner did not alter it as the animal grew. They had been abused and neglected early in life, but were finally rescued. The bear's harness was surgically removed.

After they had been taken in by an animal sanctuary in Georgia, the staff tried to separate them due to obvious concerns that the three large predators would fight. During the trial of separation, the animals were uncooperative and behaved poorly. Once reunited, the three calmed down and were well behaved.

Twelve years later, the three friends spend their days playing, cuddling, and eating together. There are no plans to separate these lifelong friends.

The slender loris found in India is a nocturnal primate. It shies away from contact with people, making it very difficult to photograph and document. To bypass the inconvenience, some photographers pay a hefty fee to photograph a captive loris. 

Some natives in the area flash bright lights at the animal and even cut down trees to gain access to the animals. They are forced into a place where they can be photographed in a managed setting. Afterward, the animal is released in an area far from where it was originally taken. The slender loris is protected in India and conservationists warn that this type of stressful interaction with humans poses a risk to the animals.

In an attempt to find out how these amazing features are possible, a group at the University of Illinois has sequenced the lotus genome and discovered some rather surprising results.

The lotus is most closely related to the common ancestor of apples, coffee, grapes, and tomatoes. The lotus has a doubling of its entire genome from 65 million years ago, and 40% of its genetic information has been retained. This shows that the lotus has a much slower mutation rate than is typically seen in plants.

The ""clouded leopard"" moniker was derived from their spotted patterning, which resemble puffy clouds.

Tesla has been largely unknown throughout history, though some of his most brilliant inventions (electric current, radio, radar, among many others) were made famous by other people. This museum seeks to set the record straight on Tesla's contributions to science and humanity, and to inspire the next generation of scientists.

Tesla has been immortalized in cartoon form by The Oatmeal, which also helped raise considerable funds for the museum.

They consume large quantities of food until the abdomen is incredibly engorged. When worker ants lack other food sources, honeypot ants simply regurgitate out nutrients for them to eat.

In some parts of the world, eating honeypot ants is viewed as a sweet delicacy.

He has reported hearing a much wider range of sounds, and that the device is much lighter than previous units he had worn.

367116489976035_586924011328614,"I've written extensively about the wonders of the mantis shrimp, and they were recently immortalized in a comic by The Oatmeal. But what about their equally awesome, but lesser known cousin, the pistol shrimp?

The pistol shrimp is the NOISIEST creature in the ocean. Colonies of them make a distinct snapping noise that overshadows nearly all other sounds throughout the world's oceans, including the calls of some whales. In fact, they are so loud, their snapping sounds interfere with military and scientific sonar (so much so, that hostile submarines have used large colonies of pistol shrimps to hide!).

So how on earth does the pistol shrimp, which can be anywhere from a couple centimeters to a couple inches in length, make such a loud sound? They possess an oversized claw which they close shut quickly enough to move water over 60 mph, creating a cavitation bubble in its wake. This bubble exists for a tiny fraction of a second (between 10 nanoseconds and 300 picoseconds), but it becomes so hot (over 4700°C) that it emits light. Yes, you read that correctly. As a comparison, the surface of the sun reaches around 5,500 °C. The cavitation bubble finally collapses and creates a bang as loud as 218 decibels. As a comparison, the space shuttle launch was as loud as 170~ decibels.

Now the next question; why? These shrimp use their super claws to stun prey. The shockwave from the collapse of the shrimp's claw is enough to stun small shrimp and fish and kill them without even touching them. They also compete with one another to see who is louder when fighting over mating rights. Overall, this shrimp is pretty awesome.

Their visible spectrum is extends far beyond ours, even past UV and IR light.

Recently, researchers studying ancient poo samples (yes, that is a field of research) found that about 900 years ago kakapos ate large amounts of pollen from a root parasite known as ""Hades flower"". Today, that plant is also incredibly rare and the two organisms are not found together, which suggests a rather interesting conservation link - was the kakapo responsible for pollinating the Hades flower?
Pure speculation of course, but very interesting nonetheless.

This year however has seen popular culture entering the confusing and systematic world of nomenclature as a new species of Bee was named after a famous catch phrase from the Big Bang Theory.

Dr. Sheldon Cooper the pedantic theoretical physicist character from the TV show is famous for his unique take on humour, usually following his jokes with a gleeful cry of 'Bazinga!' and it's this phrase that has now been immortalised. A team of Brazilian biologists discovered the orchid-bee and named it Euglossa bazinga. According to Dr. André Nemésio, a biology professor at the Universidade Federal de Uberlândia in Brazil, this was intended to 'honour actor Jim Parsons and his brilliant interpretation of Sheldon Cooper'.

Dr. Nemésio hopes that the added attention from a famous name will bring much needed exposure to the bee's plight. Many orchid-bees inhabit forests that are severely threatened through a combination of climate change and deforestation and consequently the bees themselves may disappear as well. Dr. Nemésio states that 'for many areas and many species, only a strong action from the society can reverse the extinction process. So, I think it is also a valid way to make people know about these wonderful creatures and the situation concerning their conservation status'.

Steve Molaro, the executive producer of the Big Bang Theory, was incredibly flattered and was sure Dr. Cooper would be too as 'after 'Mothra' and griffins, bees are his third-favorite flying creatures'. JB

367116489976035_495621047125578,"Betelgeuse is the eighth brightest star in the night sky and can be easily spotted in the Orion constellation with the naked eye.

It's a red giant, and will eventually become a supernova. It's at the stage now where it's ready for an explosion, so it could happen at any moment! Any moment in the next million years that is. Of course, as it's about 640 light years away from Earth it could be happening right now and we wouldn't know for centuries. Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe it happened 639 years ago.

Betelgeuse is one of the largest known stars. If it were to replace our own Sun, it would extend all the way out to the Asteroid Belt and possibly even into the orbit of Jupiter. When it finally does go supernova, the light from the explosion will light up our sky, possibly brightening to an apparent magnitude of -12. This would outshine the Moon and be easily visible in daylight. It would stay like that for two or three months before dimming. 

Luckily its rotational axis isn't pointing towards Earth, meaning a gamma ray burst strong enough to harm plants and animals here is unlikely.

Overall, a supernova would be pretty damn badass and I would really appreciate it if Betelgeuse would get a move on.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience/photos/a.456449604376056.98921.367116489976035/495621047125578/?type=3,2012-11-05 14:36:59,25827,1181,5344,25827,0,0,0,0,0

There have been plenty of guesses as to what it is - it's been speculated that it comes from a giant squid or even a whale. However, officials are leaning towards the explanation that it comes from a large, deep water fish such as a tuna or swordfish.
Either way, they plan on finding out using genetic testing and expert advice from around the world.

This is Malala Yousufzai. She's fourteen years old, and lives in Pakistan. Today, she was shot in the head for speaking out against the fact that under the Pakistani Taliban, women are not educated.

She was shot in the head for saying she should be able to go to school.

According to various news sources, the bullet did not enter her brain and she is stable.

It's very nice for us to sit here, and talk about how much we fucking love science. Almost every one of us had the opportunity to go to school, and to learn (even if some of us didn't appreciate that opportunity at the time). Yet on the other side of the world, children are dying for the right to go to school.

I don't mean to preach, and I'm sorry if I'm bumming you all out. I just thought this should noted by us: value your education. Value that you've had the opportunity to fucking love science. Some never get that chance, and some would die for that chance. 

Malala Yousufzai, speaking in 2009 aged eleven: ""I don't mind if I have to sit on the floor at school. All I want is education. And I'm afraid of no one.""

But it turns out that it's one of the coolest creatures on the planet. It's practically a rodent superhero. Check this out:

The naked mole rat does not get cancer, ever. Even when blasted with radiation, its cells  will simply die rather than develop cancer. 
They have incredibly long lifespans (they can live well into their thirties - other, similar sized rodents manage four if they're lucky) and they hardly age. For almost their entire lives, they show very little age related deterioration.
Their skin, nose and mouths are insensitive to acids and ammonia.
They can survive much, much longer than other mammals without oxygen and suffer no brain damage.
They are resistant to all kinds of stress, including plant toxins and heavy metal pollution.

Did I not tell you naked mole rats are badasses?

After returning to the site with co-workers and a television crew, they worked out that they're being made by male puffer fish. It's thought to be a 'display' to attract females and/or a shield to protect their young from potentially dangerous ocean currents.
It's about six and a half feet wide, and was painstakingly created by one male puffer fish. He worked at it for several hours, sweeping his tail in the sand to carve out the structure.

A sophisticated system of channels, similar to the roots of a tree, ensures that all 200 plant species cultivated inside the supertrees are regularly watered.

They exhibit the lowest thermal conductivity of any known solid, and are the lowest density structural materials ever developed. 
In spite of their name, aerogels are solids and not gels. The name is derived from the production process, the liquid component of a gel is extracted through supercritical drying.

This is Beauty the bald eagle. In 2005, Beauty was shot in the face by a poacher, causing the damage you see here. Her beak was so badly damaged it was impossible for her to eat or hunt on her own. Fortunately, she was rescued by volunteers at Birds of Prey Northwest before she starved to death. They nursed her back to health by hand feeding her, and hoped that she would recover. Sadly, it soon became apparent that she would never be able to be self sufficient and they considered euthanizing her.

However, raptor specialist Jane Cantwell had other ideas. She teamed up with mechanical engineer Nate Calvin as well as several other scientists, engineers and dentists to model a nylon polymer beak that would replace Beauty's damaged upper mandible. The beak was then printed on a 3-D printer, and attached to Beauty.

Thanks to their hard work and the 3-D printer, Beauty can once again eat, drink and preen herself. Unfortunately, the beak is not secure enough for her to be able to be returned to the wild, but it has meant a whole new lease of life for this magnificent bird.

A chimera is typically formed from four parent cells (either two fertilized eggs, or two early embryos that have fused together). When the organism forms, the cells that had already begun to develop in the separate embryos keep their original phenotypes and appearances. This means that the resulting animal is a mixture of tissues and can look like this gorgeous (but bizarre) kitty. 
She also has complete heterochromia, a condition when the eyes are different colours.

367116489976035_462899957064354,"Fifteen year old US high schooler Jack Andraka has invented an advanced pancreatic cancer test using search engines and open access journal papers. 
His test is 168 times faster, and 1,000 times less expensive than the currently used test. He won a $75,000 grant for his creation and will be carrying our further research at the Johns Hopkins University. 
He claims that the idea came to him as he was ""chilling out in biology class"".

Note: there's been a few people saying he should have got more than $75,000. Please note that this grant is for further research into his test, which he will be conducting himself. He is patenting his creation and I'm sure he will receive many more bursaries and grants in the future.

They are virtually indestructible and can survive being blasted with radiation, intense pressures and years of desiccation.
Specimens were launched into space by Swedish scientists and they returned unharmed after eight days.

He dissolved sugar in food colouring solutions of red, green, blue and yellow and then placed them in his garden to attract ants. Some of them even moved between the different solutions, resulting in psychedelic colour combinations.

367116489976035_388718264482524,"""You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.

And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.

And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.

And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. 

Amen.""

And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.

And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.

And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. Amen.

One of my biggest areas of focus is helping children understand what it means to be an American. My film, One Nation Under God, helps kids learn God's role in our history, and you can get it for free while supplies last. Just visit freegoddvd.com/newsmax.

But please don't wait. There are a limited number of FREE copies remaining. My team at Learn Our History created this DVD because too many children don't know the story of God's role in American history. I'm giving it away for FREE because it's a story that every child has a right to know and it's just too important not to pass on. One Nation Under God teaches kids all about God's role in the creation of our nation and how our rights and freedoms come directly from God, not the government. If you choose to receive the film, you will just need to cover $1 s&h, and if you order now, you will be set up to receive other great films from Learn Our History about important events in American history as they are released about once a month at an affordable, low price. Of course, since this is a free offer, there's no obligation or commitment. But you'll love the positive, patriotic and faith based lessons that your children or grandchildren will learn. Learn Our History always guarantees that kids will learn and have fun, or your money back. So there's no risk. Whether you choose to place an order or not, join me in committing to keeping God's role in American history an important part of your child's education.",,status,,2015-01-14 08:30:00,132,50,18,132,0,0,0,0,0

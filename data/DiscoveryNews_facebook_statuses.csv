A new, improved sequencing of ancient human relative genomes reveals that Homo sapiens didn't only have sex with Neanderthals and a little-understood line of humans called Denisovans. A fourth, mystery lineage of humans was in the mix, too.

As reported by the news arm of the journal Nature, new genetic evidence suggests that several hominids -- human relatives closer than humans' current living cousin, the chimpanzee -- interbred more than 30,000 years ago. This group of kissing cousins included an unknown human ancestor not yet revealed by the ancient DNA record.

It's hard being a robot exploring another world, as NASA's Mars Science Laboratory has proven this month.

On Nov. 17, mission managers of the six-wheeled rover Curiosity announced that they were troubleshooting a suspected ""soft short"" in the robot's electrical system. A soft short is a glitch where a small amount of power is leached through a material that's partially conductive.

Curiosity's electronics are built with this eventuality in mind, so mission engineers weren't overly alarmed. However, the resulting voltage drop from the rover's chassis and power bus was cause for concern and could have affected the mission's robustness against more soft shorts in the future.

Sunspots have been observed for millennia -- first by Chinese astronomers and then, for the first time with a telescope, by Galileo in 1610. They appear in roughly 11-year cycles -- increasing to a daily flurry and then subsiding drastically, before amping up again. But this cycle -- dubbed Cycle 24 -- has surprised scientists with its sluggishness.

Music skills evolved at least 30 million years ago in the common ancestor of humans and monkeys, according to a new study that could help explain why chimpanzees drum on tree roots and monkey calls sound like singing.

The study, published in the latest issue of Biology Letters, also suggests an answer to this chicken-and-egg question: Which came first, language or music? The answer appears to be music.

""Musical behaviors would constitute a first step towards phonological patterning, and therefore language.""

In experiments, the gene-encoding patch has already regrown bone fully enough to cover skull wounds in test animals. It has also stimulated new growth in human bone marrow stromal cells. Eventually, the patch could be used to repair birth defects involving missing bone around the head or face.

Another Friday the 13th is upon us, and it will inevitably raise fears of bad luck in some people. It's 2013; we have satellites in orbit, we can talk live on small portable devices between nearly any two points on Earth, and we can see more cat videos in one day than our forefathers could have dared dream of.

It's the age of science, yet ancient superstitions still have a hold on us. Many superstitions seem insignificant or even silly -- who really cares if you avoid a black cat's path? There is a fine, and sometimes downright blurry, line between superstition, myth and urban legend. But not all superstitions are harmless.

In some places, people believe that the body parts of albinos can bring them good luck. In the East African countries of Tanzania and Burundi, dozens of albinos have been murdered for this reason since 2008, according to the Red Cross. Superstition has also contributed to the decline of some of the world's most magnificent animals: Several species of rhinos have been driven to near extinction because of demand for their horns, claimed to act as an aphrodisiac or even cure cancer.

The idea of acoustic levitation is certainly not new. Several levitation methods exist today, including using electrostatic forces, magnetism and light. But each of these techniques has it own drawback. For example, light can only manipulate matter that's very tiny (up to about 50 microns, the size of a human liver cell), whereas magnetic levitation requires the material to have special properties.

Sound waves, on the other hand, can float larger objects, independent of material properties. The basic setup requires an acoustic emitter and a reflector placed some distance away. When the sound is turned on, it bounces off the reflector and back towards the emitter.

As far as planets go, HD 189733b, a giant, sizzling Jupiter-like world that swoops around its parent star every 2.2 days, couldn't be more different from Earth.

But the planet, located 63 light-years away in the constellation Vulpecula (the Fox), has one feature that is familiar: it's blue.

The discovery, made in central China's Hubei Province and reported in the journal Nature, strengthens the theory that Asia was the center of primate evolution. The new species, Archicebus achilles, also suggests that our earliest ancestors were very small.

THE 'WOW!' SIGNAL: INTERCEPTED ALIEN TRANSMISSION? (http://ow.ly/ltvg1)

SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, has seen astronomers scouring the sky for decades in hopes of receiving artificially generated radio signals sent by alien civilizations. But then, there's a good chance we've already found just such a signal. And 1977 saw the most tantalizing glimpse ever.

Nicknamed the ""Wow!"" signal, this was a brief burst of radio waves detected by astronomer Jerry Ehman who was working on a SETI project at the Big Ear radio telescope, Ohio. The signal was, in fact, so remarkable that Ehman circled it on the computer printout, writing ""Wow!"" in the margin — and unintentionally giving the received radio signal the name under which it would become famous.

After the Big Bang, the universe expanded so rapidly that matter itself resonated to create a deep bass noise, and sound waves themselves became stretched and warped. ""As the early universe expanded, sound waves propagated through the dense medium that closed back on itself, so that the hypersphere of the universe rang like a bell,"" Cramer, a professor of physics at the University of Washington, explained.

Water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake, depositing gold, according to a model published in the March 17 issue of the journal Nature Geoscience. The model provides a quantitative mechanism for the link between gold and quartz seen in many of the world's gold deposits.

When an earthquake strikes, it moves along a rupture in the ground — a fracture called a fault. Big faults can have many small fractures along their length, connected by jogs that appear as rectangular voids. Water often lubricates faults, filling in fractures and jogs.

The samples obtained from the underground lake in May 2012 contained a bacteria which bore no resemblance to existing types, said Sergei Bulat of the genetics laboratory at the Saint Petersburg Institute of Nuclear Physics.

""After putting aside all possible elements of contamination, DNA was found that did not coincide with any of the well-known types in the global database,"" he said.

3D printing technology has helped replace 75 percent of a patient's skull with the approval of U.S. regulators.

The 3D-printed implant can replace the bone in people's skulls damaged by disease or trauma, according to Oxford Performance Materials. The company announced it had received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its skull implant on Feb. 18 — a decision that led to the first U.S. surgical operation on March 4.

3D printing's advantage comes from taking the digitally scanned model of a patient's skull and ""printing"" out a matching 3D object layer by layer. The precise manufacturing technique can even make tiny surface or edge details on the replacement part that encourage the growth of cells and allow bone to attach more easily.

Discovered in 2011 and 2012 by the Hubble Space Telescope, this tiny duo joins Charon, Nix and Hydra in a very close-knit family of objects orbiting Pluto.

MURDEROUS GREAT TITS (http://ow.ly/hyIps):
There are dinosaurs among us, and ruthless ones at that. Don't scoff — it's true. Need proof? Look no further than the Great Tit, aka ""The Zombie Tit."" Why is it called ""The Zombie Tit?"" Because it's a killing machine with a single mission. To eat brains.

DON'T LAUGH. Do not. Laugh. The Great Tit might hear you, and if that happens then there's a chance you'll never laugh again. 

Most researchers accept that modern birds belong to a specialized subgroup of theropods (the clade encompassing T. rex and Velociraptor), making them perhaps the only branch of dinosaurs to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago.

PLANNING FOR AN INTERSTELLAR ROAD TRIP:
Rather than building an interstellar 'worldship,' a smaller Colonized Interstellar Vessel may be our ticket to the stars.

As the process toward the first human interstellar mission will be the culmination of decades or perhaps centuries of thoughtful discussion and careful development, it is imperative that concepts and ideas be contributed from many sources.

Design for the psyche and associated pragmatic daily functions should be of equal concern as those of cosmic radiation shielding, food production, reuse of disassembled structures at the target destination planet, etc. Should the precious human component be allowed to atrophy, the complete interstellar mission risks failure.

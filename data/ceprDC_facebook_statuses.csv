Organization Description: The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) was established in 1999 to promote democratic debate on the most important economic and social issues that affect people's lives. In order for citizens to effectively exercise their voices in a democracy, it is necessary that they be informed about the problems and choices that they face. An informed public should then be able to choose policies that lead to an improving quality of life, both for people within the United States, and around the world.
Toward this end, CEPR conducts both professional research and public education so that the public is better prepared to choose among the various policy options. The professional research is oriented towards filling important gaps in the understanding of particular economic and social problems, or the impact of specific policies, both domestically and globally. The public education portion of CEPR's mission is to present the findings of professional research, both by CEPR and others, in a manner that allows broad segments of the public to know exactly what is at stake in major policy debates. As part of its public education initiative, CEPR utilizes research findings and analysis to challenge the myths, assumptions, policies and institutions that perpetuate economic and social inequality.
CEPR's founding scholars include Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot, Co-Directors of CEPR, and Robert Pollin, Professor of Economics, University of Massachusetts.
Job Description: CEPR has an immediate opening for a full-time Research Assistant (International). The focus of this work will be international economic policy issues. Responsibilities include collection and analysis of data, preparation of charts and graphs, research literature and summarization of relevant background material.

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor - 12/08/16 04:17 PM EST

Much of the media, and the analysts on which it relies, has provided a misleading narrative on the current political problems in Italy, following Sunday's ""no"" vote on a referendum on constitutional changes.
It has been lumped together with President-elect Donald Trump's victory; Brexit, when the British voted to leave the European Union; the upsurge of extreme right-wing, anti-European or racist political parties; and ""populism,"" which in much of the media seems to be code for demagogic politicians persuading ignorant masses to vote for stupid things.
""Stupid things"" here is defined as whatever the establishment media doesn't like.
Of course, we do not have a detailed map of why various Italian voters rejected the proposed constitutional changes. The most obvious explanation is that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who has been in power since February 2014, had promised to resign if the people voted ""no.""
This mobilized all of his political opponents, including those within his own party.
Those who wanted to defend Renzi had a hard sell. He was not offering a future for the country, especially for the young people who most overwhelmingly voted ""no."" Unemployment is at 11.6 percent, and youth unemployment is more than 36 percent.

NACLA Report on the Americas, Volume 48, Issue 4, December 2, 2016
(This is article is part of a forum titled ""A New Agenda in U.S.-Latin American Relations"" published in the winter issue of NACLA Report on the Americas.)

The movement for Latin American integration has seen better days. At the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean appeared to be on the verge of realizing Simón Bolívar and José Martí's dream of Latin American unity. The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was formally established and making major strides in conflict mediation as well as defense and infrastructure cooperation. In 2010, every Latin American and Caribbean government (except for the post-coup government of Honduras) had agreed to create a new regional group—the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)—a regional body that excluded the U.S. and Canada. Shortly thereafter CELAC would adopt a bold agenda featuring plans for ""political, economic, social, and cultural integration.""
These exciting developments were rooted in the decade's seismic political shift: left-leaning movements and parties that rejected socially and economically destructive ""Washington Consensus"" policies and U.S.-backed free trade agreements were voted into office all across the region. A core group of Left governments, led by Cuba and Venezuela, formed the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), an explicitly anti-neoliberal alliance originally conceived as an ""alternative"" to the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA, or ALCA in Spanish). By late 2005 the FTAA was correctly pronounced ""dead"" by Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, in large part because left-leaning figures now held the reins of power in two of the biggest economies in the region, Argentina and Brazil.

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor - 12/02/16 03:38 PM EST
Reactions to the death of Fidel Castro have highlighted some of the differences in the way the Cuban revolutionary and longtime head of state is perceived throughout the world.
Most of the world admires Castro and Cuba as having accomplished something heroic by standing up to a bullying empire of immense power, defending the country's national sovereignty and living to tell about it.
Not to mention the millions of people aided by Cuban doctors and healthcare workers and other acts of international solidarity that are perhaps unrivaled in modern history, especially for a nation of Cuba's size and income level.
In the belly of the bully, things look different. And we are not just talking about President-elect Donald Trump's impolite rant upon Castro's death, true to form and pandering to the waning but still influential Republican base of right-wing Florida Cuban-Americans. From the New York Times subhead of its obituary for Fidel:
Mr. Castro brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere, bedeviled 11 American presidents and briefly pushed the world to the brink of nuclear war.
Let's look for a moment at one piece of this unintentional humor: Just who brought the Cold War to this hemisphere?
A few years before the Cuban revolution, Washington overthrew the democratically elected government of Guatemala under the false pretext that it was a beachhead of Soviet communism in the hemisphere.

Dan Beeton and Rebecca Watts
NACLA Report on the Americas, Volume 48, Issue 4, December 2, 2016
Despite cheerleading from some, US security aid to Honduras continues to sow violence.
A recent, widely shared essay in the New York Times glowed about US-funded crime and violence reduction programs in Honduras. The August 14, 2016, article, ""How the Most Dangerous Place on Earth Got Safer: Programs funded by the United States are helping transform Honduras. Who says American power is dead?"" by Sonia Nazario, profiled members of the Rivera Hernández community in San Pedro Sula. It had, just a few years ago, Nazario writes, ""the highest homicide rate in the city,"" but this summer the author returned ""to find a remarkable reduction in violence, much of it thanks to programs funded by the United States that have helped community leaders tackle crime.""
The article was, in some ways, a feel-good piece. The author profiled several people in Honduras who have struggled with gangs and violence in their communities, but for whom the future appears much more hopeful. The problem is that this is, by definition, anecdotal evidence. While Nazario points out that Honduras no longer has the ""highest homicide rate in the world"" (which, as Honduran outlet La Prensa has noted, may itself have to do with problematic data keeping by the Honduran authorities), it is widely recognized that violence and organized crime continue in Honduras, and elsewhere in Central America, at unacceptable levels. As has been documented in the media and various human rights reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Honduran organizations and the US State Department itself, Honduran troops and police officers are responsible for some of these murders, and for other grave human rights abuses as well. http://ow.ly/ejHw306KMWT",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ceprDC/photos/a.183938150521.155174.12350395521/10154748312955522/?type=3,2016-12-02 14:05:10,7,2,3,6,0,0,0,0,1

The Huffington Post, November 28, 2016

Fair Traders who are celebrating the defeat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) may see their hard work undone if the talks towards the proposed Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) continue under a Trump administration. 
Many Democrats who minimized the importance of the negative impacts of corporate trade deals on working class Americans have now paid the price in the recent elections. As my colleagues at the Center for Economic and Policy Research have pointed out, racists and xenophobes were always going to vote for Trump but the key voters the Democrats were counting on that they lost were largely working class voters, many of them union members, in states hit hard by trade deals (supported by both parties) that put working class people in competition with lower-income manufacturing workers in other countries while preserving protections for intellectual property-holders and high income professions.
While these working class voters may have voted against their economic interests in terms of workers' rights, social security, work/life balance, and other pro-worker provisions in the Democratic platform, they were right that both parties have become too aligned with corporate interests — and trade agreements is one of several instances where that is the case.
It is yet to be seen how or if President-elect Trump will make good on his pledges on trade to these voters, but in the initial preview of his first days in office, he has promised to withdraw from the TPP. Likewise the talks with the EU on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) are on hold. In the EU, the EU-Canada agreement, known as CETA, is in limbo while the European Court of Justice decides whether the dispute settlement mechanism in the agreement complies with EU law.

    Written by Lara Merling 
    Published: 22 November 2016 
In the summer of 1996, the Los Angeles Times was warning its readers about ""the shadow of rising inflation"" [1] looming over U.S. financial markets ""like the mammoth alien spacecrafts of Independence Day,"" the blockbuster movie of the time. The article suggested the danger of inflation was imminent and concluded that ""for the shell-shocked bond market, there will be an assumption that either the Fed is going to tighten credit, or inflation is going to continue to rise, or both.""
The general consensus in 1996 was that the economy was at, or very close to full employment. Unemployment was at its lowest level in years, which was about 5.4 percent. In their outlook for 1996–2000, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) was 6 percent. The CBO also warned that ""if rapid growth continues, inflationary pressures will mount.""
Martin Feldstein, then President of the National Bureau of Economic Research, expressed his concern with unemployment being too low as early as March 1995. Feldstein stated that while ""people have argued that we can tolerate much lower interest rates than in past U.S. historical experience,"" he did not ""think that's true."" Feldstein declared the unemployment rate of 5.4 percent as being ""well below the unemployment rate that even the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would call full employment"" and urged the Fed to severely tighten monetary policy. Feldstein estimated NAIRU at 6.23 percent and concluded that the possibility of being wrong was ""quite low.""

12350395521_10154719936505522,"The Housing Bubble: Is It Back?
November 2016, Lara Merling and Dean Baker
In the last decade, there was an unprecedented run-up in house prices in most parts of the country. It was easy to recognize this run-up as a bubble since there was no remotely corresponding increase in rents, which for the most part just tracked inflation during this period. There was also no evidence of a shortage of housing supply. Housing starts were at near record highs from 2002 to 2005. In addition, the vacancy rate as reported by the Commerce Department was at near record highs through most of this period. With weak job and wage growth throughout most of this period, it was possible to recognize the run-up as a bubble even without knowing anything about the proliferation of bad loans in the mortgage market.
The run-up in real house prices in the bubble years was almost completely reversed in the subsequent crash. While the first-time homebuyers' tax credit temporarily stopped and reversed the decline, house prices continued to fall until the spring of 2012. Since then, the market has recovered much of the lost ground. While it is still 20.1 percent below the bubble peaks of 2006 in real terms, inflation-adjusted house prices are now 37.7 percent above their level in 1996, before the beginnings of the bubble.
While these prices may seem somewhat high, there is little basis for concern that the national market has again entered a bubble. http://ow.ly/ARE6306q7dp",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ceprDC/photos/a.183938150521.155174.12350395521/10154719936505522/?type=3,2016-11-22 10:45:18,7,0,7,6,1,0,0,0,0

    Dean Baker, 21 November 2016 
There are sharp differences between the political parties in many areas, but one principle on which there has been a longstanding agreement is that the presidency should not be used as a marketing platform for the president's personal business interests. Donald Trump seems determined to break with this principle.
The basic point is simple: when you enter the White House you put your assets into a blind trust. This way when the president makes decisions in various areas of foreign and domestic policy, he or she does not know whether they will personallly profit from them. The idea is that we want the president to make decisions based on whether they are good for the country, not whether they will fatten their pocketbook.
Presidents of both parties dating back to Lyndon Johnson followed the practice of putting their assets into a blind trust. Richard Nixon did it, Gerald Ford did it, as did Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. Both President Bushes put their assets into a blind trust. And President Reagan put his assets into a blind trust.
None of these presidents had any problem with the idea that they should not be a position to know whether their actions were directly helping or hurting them financially. Apparently, Donald Trump thinks he is different.

BY Dean Baker  November 18, 2016 at 6:24 PM EST
Most educated people like to think of themselves as supporters of free trade. After all, everyone who has been through Economics 101 knows that tariffs and other trade barriers slow growth and encourage waste and corruption. Therefore, we should all want to see as few barriers as possible obstructing trade.
While there are some issues that make the story a bit more complicated than the Econ 101 version, as a general rule we will benefit from having lower barriers to trade. This fact should cause all right-thinking people to be very upset about the protectionist barriers that artificially inflate the earnings of doctors in the United States.
Most people are probably not aware of the extraordinary level of protectionism that benefits doctors and, to a lesser extent, other highly paid professionals in our own country. A long list of trade agreements over the last 60 years has reduced or eliminated most of the tariffs and trade barriers on manufactured goods. This has led to a surge in imports, which has had major consequences for the U.S. labor market. But there has been no comparable effort to reduce the barriers that keep foreign professionals from working in the United States.
Under the current regulatory structure, foreign-trained doctors generally have to complete a U.S. residency program to practice medicine in the United States. This applies even to doctors with many years of experience, including those in countries that have high quality health care systems, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands.

In the aftermath of the election, independent media is more important than ever. Can you make a donation to support the publication of more stories like this one?
Remember all those times the Republicans in Congress shut down the government and threatened to default on the debt? The ostensible cause was the out of control deficit. Back in the day when President Obama was drafting the budget, these Republicans were arguing that the national debt threatened the well-being of our children and grandchildren. They claimed to view deficit reduction as a sacred cause.
Well, we're about to see a religious conversion of world historic size as the Republican Party, and its congressional leader Paul Ryan, convert from deficit hawks to big spenders. With Donald Trump in the White House, we're going to discover that they think large deficits are just fine.
The basic story is straightforward. Trump has promised both an infrastructure program and large tax cuts which will primarily benefit the rich. On some days he has also promised big increases in military spending, but it's not clear where this commitment stands.

Written by Jeff Hauser
Published: 20 November 2016
Jeff Hauser runs the Revolving Door Project, an effort to increase scrutiny on executive branch appointments and ensure that political appointees are focused on serving the public interest, rather than personal professional advancement.
As we hear of a settlement in the ""Trump University"" civil fraud case brought in part by New York State Attorney General and learn more and more about potential Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the phrase ""personnel is policy"" takes on an unfortunate new meaning.
Will Trump's appointees to high government office ensure Donald Trump does not use control of the executive branch to enrich himself and his family?
Trump enriching himself as president is not an idle or libelous question. Trump himself raised the prospect in 2000 to Fortune Magazine, telling them that ""[i]t's very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.""
Matt Yglesias puts the threat to the rule posed by Donald Trump and the ""Trump Organization"" in stark language, arguing ""Trump's first 100 days could also be the last 100 days in which America's system of republican government can be saved."" Yglesias fears that the potential for corruption is so great that ""political favor"" might become ""the primary driver of economic success.""

Dems need alternative to four decades of neoliberal failure
By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 

The polls were wrong, the unthinkable has happened, and Donald Trump has been elected the 45th president of the United States, with a Republican Congress.
The swing voters, as in most presidential elections of the past few decades, were white working-class voters. It would be worthwhile therefore to think about how a large majority of this group ended up voting against their own interests.
Many liberals will blame the voters themselves, seeing them as racist, misogynistic and otherwise backward and ignorant.
There is no doubt that Trump voters are worse than average in attitudes toward non-white Americans, immigrants and women.
After all, most of them are Republicans; about 90 percent of Republicans voted for Trump and that is the bulk of his base. The Republican Party, since at least the civil rights movement and legislation of the 1960s and its ""Southern strategy,"" has been a white people's party. It has also engaged in a ""war on women"" before Trump took the stage to literally add a lot of insults to the injuries.
So, no surprises there, even if he used a police whistle instead of just a dog whistle.
The more important question is what moved the swing voters. (Read more: http://ow.ly/1I873062KyM )",Dems need alternative to four decades of neoliberal failure,link,http://ow.ly/1I873062KyM,2016-11-10 09:55:07,51,3,19,47,4,0,0,0,0

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 
The Vatican's participation in the mediation effort in Venezuela poses an unusual challenge to US policy in Venezuela and the region. On Sunday, October 30, three of the four major opposition parties and other prominent opposition leaders met with the government, with mediators from the Vatican and UNASUR (the Union of South American Nations).  Some progress was made.
The government released four people whom the opposition considers political prisoners, and the opposition called off a political trial against President Maduro and a demonstration that most observers believed ran a high risk of violence.
Thomas Shannon, the number three official in the US State Department, also went to Venezuela this week, met with President Maduro and opposition leaders, and supported the dialogue. I wish I could say that this represents an actual change in the US policy in the region, but all evidence still points to the contrary.
The US government is not looking at Venezuela in terms of dialogue or compromise. The Obama administration has economic sanctions against Venezuela, which President Obama renewed last March. In renewing these sanctions, the executive order again declared that Venezuela presented ""an unusual and extraordinary threat to US security.""
The world knows what happens to countries that the US deems to be ""an unusual and extraordinary"" security threat.  Look what happened to Iraq.  Look what happened to Nicaragua in the 1980s. It doesn't matter how many people are directly affected by the specific sanctions against Venezuela. The threat is what matters, and it is ugly and belligerent enough to keep many investors from investing in Venezuela and to raise the country's cost of borrowing.

Since a 2009 military coup against the democratic government of President Mel Zelaya, Honduras has become the most dangerous country in the world for environmental and human rights activists.

This follows the Oct. 9 assassination attempts against Tomás Gómez Membreño, the general coordinator of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), and COPINH community leader Alexander García Sorto.
Unfortunately, this continuing wave of political violence has a lot to do not only with the corrupt, repressive government that rules Honduras, but also with the U.S. government.
Washington played a major role in consolidating the 2009 military coup and continues to supply tens of millions of dollars of military and security aid annually to the government.

After years of denial, the UN recently acknowledged its role and vowed to help cholera victims.

International trade and migration are fundamental and interrelated components of globalization that have the potential to improve the lives of working families. For far too long, however, trade and immigration policies have prioritized corporate interests over good jobs and worker rights.
Since the implementation of the NAFTA in 1994, corporate-driven free trade agreements have undermined workers' bargaining power, disrupted rural economies, and displaced whole communities in developing countries. Millions of workers have been driven from their homes and families, often undertaking difficult journeys in search of work abroad, where their status is precarious and they are likely to face abuse, exploitation and discrimination.
Now politicians and corporations seek to repeat the failed policies of the past by implementing the TPP, a massive trade deal between the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations. The TPP would repeat and expand economic rules that destabilize communities, perpetuate low wages and undermine labor rights—all of which are factors driving forced migration.

Mark Weisbrot
Truthout, October 23, 2016
The international media have provided a constant fusillade of stories and editorials (not always easily distinguished from each other) about the collapse of the Venezuelan economy for some time now. Shortages of food and medicine, hours-long lines for basic goods, incomes eroded by triple-digit inflation and even food riots have dominated press reports.
The conventional wisdom has a set of predictable narratives to explain the current economic mess. ""Socialism"" has failed -- never mind that the vast majority of jobs created during the Hugo Chávez years were in the private sector, and that the size of the state has been much smaller than in France. The whole experiment, it is said, was a failure from the beginning.
According to this narrative, nationalizations, anti-business policies, populist overspending during the years of high oil prices and the collapse of oil prices since 2014 sealed Venezuela's fate. Adherents to this explanation say the downward spiral will continue until the chavistas are removed from power, either through elections or through a coup (most pundits don't seem to care which).

After another devastating natural disaster, Haiti once again needs help. With the country still trying to recover from the 2010 earthquake, Hurricane Matthew was its worst storm in half a century.  Hundreds are dead, and more than 120,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. More than 1.4 million people require urgent humanitarian assistance.
But foreign involvement in Haiti, recent and historic, has often done more harm than good. Haiti won its independence in 1804 but was forced to pay billions of dollars in ""reparations"" to former coloniser France through the mid-20th century. After occupying Haiti in the early 1900s, the US backed two presidential coups in 1990 and 2004, and  played a controversial role in its 2010 presidential election. Food aid to Haiti since the 1990s has hurt Haitian farmers unable to compete with subsidised US rice and corn. Post-earthquake aid from around the world was widely criticised for lining the pockets of contractors and NGOs while failing to reach those in need. A United Nations peacekeeping force brought cholera to Haiti in 2010, but only this year -- after nearly 10,000 deaths -- did the UN finally admit responsibility.

A strongly-worded book on how blindly following the western doctrine could be harmful for nations
By: Madan Sabnavis | New Delhi | Published: October 16, 20166:06 AM

The financial crisis, followed by the Euro imbroglio, has produced probably the largest number of books in recent times. Some tomes tell us how the crises came about and were addressed, while others have been critical of the capitalist system that engenders greed. The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and their chiefs have been the protagonists in all these expositions. Mark Weisbrot, the author of Failed, starts off from these crises to build his theory of how the so-called new-liberal policies, built around the Washington Consensus, have failed, and why we should think differently. In fact, he details how these policies have ossified economic growth paths of nations, while those that did break with their commandments have done better.
Look at the US and Euro regions. Both faced a crisis of immense magnitude. Yet, the US officially came out of the recession after 18 months in 2009, while Euro zone countries continue to struggle to get out of it. Here, the author points out the differences in approach from the policy perspective. In the US, the government was responsible towards the people and the politicians could not get away with so-called conservative, or rather 'oppressive', policies. Quantitative easing was a result of this thinking. As various measures of easing started almost immediately, the country was able to come out of the rut.

The European pressure on developing countries was widely condemned by the public, and revealed the corporate, antidevelopment efforts behind the deal, just as they are revealed today.

The song was released in 1963, when the antiwar movement in the US was still very small. But millions would hear it, and along with other songs that he wrote and recorded, it would undoubtedly contribute to that movement and its consciousness.

    Written by Jake Johnston 
    Published: 13 October 2016 
Port-au-Prince, Haiti ― Under the leadership of an interim government since February, Haiti will now wait a little longer to elect a president after Hurricane Matthew struck the island, with 130 mile-per-hour winds and up to two feet of rain last week. Elections scheduled for October 9 have been put on hold, with Haiti's provision electoral council (CEP) expected to announce a new date on Friday.
As the scale of the damage becomes clearer in Haiti's rural Tiburon peninsula, where entire communities were left destroyed and under water, negotiations are ongoing in the relatively unscathed capital of Port-au-Prince, where political and economic power has long resided. Pressure is building on Haiti's besieged interim president Jocelerme Privert to hold the elections in the coming weeks, but an internal assessment of electoral infrastructure obtained by Haiti: Relief and Reconstruction Watch reveals massive damage to voting centers throughout the hardest-hit departments.
Some 30 percent of voting centers remained inaccessible in the most impacted areas according to the report compiled by the Organization of American States (OAS), while of those that were visited, 70 percent were rendered inoperable. The storm-ravaged departments are home to roughly one million of Haiti's approximately 5.9 million registered voters. Across the country, meanwhile, the government estimates 1.4 million people to be in need of humanitarian assistance.

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 
Republican nominee Donald Trump's embarrassments and scandals keep piling up, from his Twitter meltdown last Friday night to The New York Times' revelations that he could have gotten away without paying income taxes for the past 18 years.
These may have some impact on the race, although it's tough to guess how much. But a recent piece in the Times about Trump's potential influence on the stock market could really take some votes away from him, if it happens to go viral.
The article, by economist Justin Wolfers, estimates that a Trump victory on Nov. 8 will take 10 to 12 percent off of the value of the stock market. It's a crude estimate, but the logic appears to be sound. He bases it on the performance of stock market index futures on the evening of the Sept. 26 presidential debate. To summarize very briefly, when Trump was doing badly in the debate — e.g. when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was hammering him about his tax returns and prediction markets indicated that his chances of winning the election were falling — the stock market index futures went up. The correlation is strong enough to extrapolate an estimated impact of an actual Trump win.

12350395521_10154549647260522,"Obama inadvertently gives high praise to China in UN speech
By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 
President Obama's speech at the U.N. last week was mostly a defense of the world's economic and political status quo, especially that part of it that is led or held in place by the U.S. government and the global institutions that Washington controls or dominates. In doing so, he said some things that were exaggerated or wrong, or somewhat misleading. It is worth looking at some of the things that media reports on this speech missed.
""Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent."" This is roughly true, according to World Bank data, but the story of how it happened goes against his whole speech — which argues that this progress is a result of the ""globalization"" that Washington leads and supports wherever it has influence in the developing world. In fact, the majority of the reduction in extreme poverty during this period (more than 1.1 billion people worldwide) took place in China.
But during this period, China was really the counterexample to the ""principles of open markets"" with which Obama insists ""we must go forward, not backward.""
China's historically unprecedented economic growth in the past 25 years (or 35 years, or even more) was accomplished with state-owned enterprises and banks dominating the economy.

It has ignored repression by regimes close to Washington and dismissed criticism—by Nobel laureates—of its conflicts of interest.
By Mark Weisbrot
Today 11:38 am
 
Human rights organizations are supposed to defend universal principles such as the rule of law and freedom from state repression. But when they are based in the United States and become close to the US government, they often find themselves aligned with US foreign policy. This damages their credibility and can hurt the cause of human rights.
 Recent events in Latin America have highlighted this problem. On August 29, the Brazilian Senate removed the elected president, Dilma Rousseff, from office, even though the federal prosecutor assigned to her case had determined that the accounting procedures for which she was being impeached did not constitute a crime. Moreover, leaked transcripts of phone calls between political leaders of the impeachment showed that they were trying to get rid of Dilma in order to protect themselves from investigations into their own corruption.
 Michel Temer, who has already been banned from running for office because of campaign finance violations, replaced an elected president who had committed no crime. Everything about the process was political—and now the new government is trying to implement a right-wing agenda that was defeated in the last three presidential elections.

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 
Oliver Stone's biopic of Edward Snowden opened the past weekend and has done quite well, especially for a film that focuses on the abuses of the U.S. government and was — like most such movies — difficult for a three-time Academy Award-winning director to even make in the United States. A solid majority of the reviews were favorable, and among viewers it was even more popular.
Interestingly, a number of critics saw the movie as ""restrained,"" or not as forceful as it could have been, given the lies and crimes that Snowden exposed. But this seems reminiscent of those perceptual psychology experiments where the subjects are asked to count how many times basketball players pass the ball, and in the process completely miss that an intruder has walked onto to the court.
Consider this statement from Snowden in the movie, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt:
""You're also being ordered to follow most world leaders and heads of industry ... because you're also tracking trade deals, sex scandals, diplomatic cables to give the U.S. an advantage in negotiations at the G-8, or leverage over Brazilian oil companies, or helping to oust some Third World leader who isn't playing ball. Ultimately, the truth sinks in no matter what justifications you're selling yourself: This isn't about terrorism; terrorism is the excuse. This is about economic and social control, and the only thing you're protecting is the supremacy of your government.""
This is a pretty in-your-face criticism of empire, the kind that we rarely hear in the major media — even if the simple truth of it is well-known to tens of millions of Americans. The idea that foreign terrorism, which kills fewer Americans than lightning each year, could be used as an excuse for all kinds of abuses and interventions worldwide, is widely suppressed in the United States.

This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Challenge on July 25, 2016, available online:  http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/05775132.2016.1202029
Over the last decade and a half, an epoch-making change took place in international economic relations. This change was so big that it was probably the most important development in the international financial system since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in 1973. But hardly anyone noticed it.
What happened is that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lost most of its influence in developing countries—in particular the middle-income countries. This has turned out to be important for a number of reasons. It is most likely part of the explanation of why most developing countries have done better in the twenty-first century than they did during the pro longed economic growth failure during the last two decades of the twentieth century. The IMF often spearheaded big neoliberal policy reforms that coincided with the slowdown: tighter (and sometimes pro-cyclical) monetary and fiscal policies; the abandonment of development strategies and industrial policies; various forms of deregulation; and an often indiscriminate opening of international trade and capital flows.
While these reforms may have been helpful in some circumstances, as a package—and often applied as a one-size-fits-all package—they often brought awful results. In the past five years we have seen, for example, how disastrous it has been for Europe to get its basic macroeconomic policies wrong. But these are high-income countries—even Spain, Greece, and Portugal are relatively well off compared to most developing countries.

Militarized law enforcement may have done more damage to human rights than it has to crime rates.
BY Parker Asmann
A new paper released last week by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) disputes data from a 2014 report on U.S.-funded anti-crime programs in Central America, suggesting these programs may not have been as effective as previously thought.
In 2007, then-president George W. Bush created the Merida Initiative, a security cooperation agreement between the United States, Mexico and Central America, as a regional response to rising drug trafficking and violence in Central America. Furthering this approach, in 2010 President Obama created the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), separating the Central American countries from the Merida Initiative.
According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), between 2008 and 2015, the U.S. has appropriated at least $1.2 billion to Central America through these two initiatives to provide equipment, training and technical assistance to support immediate law enforcement operations in the region, consequently leading to a more militarized violence prevention method that has been widely criticized. http://ow.ly/As1z30496op",The U.S. Spends Millions Funding Central America's Drug War.

    By Jake Johnston, 07 September 2016 

""The situation cannot afford Washington to sit on sidelines. They elected him and they need [sic] pressure him. He can't go unchecked,"" Laura Graham, then the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation, wrote to Bill Clinton in early 2012. Graham was referring to the increasingly erratic, and potentially dangerous, behavior of Haitian president Michel Martelly. When she said ""They elected him,"" she was referring to the US government, which intervened through the OAS to change the election results of the first round of Haiti, putting Martelly in to the second round. The e-mail, one of many Graham sent to Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff on February 26, 2012, eventually was sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aide, Cheryl Mills. The note is perhaps the clearest evidence to date that key officials, even within the Clinton camp, viewed the US intervention in the 2010 Haitian election as decisive.
The 2010 Haitian election was a mess. Held less than a year after a devastating earthquake, millions of people were displaced or otherwise disenfranchised and then-president René Préval was accused of fraud on behalf of his preferred candidate Jude Célestin. A majority of candidates held an afternoon press conference on election day denouncing the process and calling for new elections. But Washington and its allies, who had funded the election, pushed forward, telling the press that everything was okay. Mirlande Manigat, a constitutional law professor and former first lady, and Célestin came in first and second, respectively, according to preliminary results, putting them into a scheduled run-off. Martelly was in third, a few thousand votes behind.

Finds Study Doesn't Show that Areas Subject to Treatment in CARSI Programs Have Better Results
September 7, 2016

Washington, DC – A new paper from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) questions the findings of one of the only studies to measure the impact of Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) anticrime programs. The CEPR paper, ""Have US-Funded CARSI Programs Reduced Crime and Violence in Central America?"" by David Rosnick, Alexander Main, and Laura Jung, examines data collected during a Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) study and subjects them to a number of statistical tests. CEPR finds problems with the methodology used and that the study cannot support the conclusion that the areas subject to treatment in the CARSI programs showed better results than those areas that were not.
""Unfortunately, the study does not demonstrate a correlation between anticrime treatment and actual crime reduction outcomes,"" Rosnick, an economist and computer scientist, said. ""This is especially important considering ongoing congressional debates over funding support to Honduras and other countries, and the prevalence of crime in pushing people to flee the Northern Triangle countries of Central America.""
The study by the Vanderbilt University-based LAPOP is, to date, the only publicly accessible impact assessment of programs carried out under CARSI, a US government initiative that has received over a billion dollars in US funding. The CEPR paper attempts to evaluate the success of USAID-funded anticrime programs in Central America under CARSI, and identifies major problems with the LAPOP study, namely, the nonrandomness of the selection of treatment versus control areas and how the differences in initial conditions, as well as differences in results between treatment and control areas, have been interpreted.

They really seem to ignore that the reason they had this recession and the reason it's been so deep and the reason that Dilma got into trouble is because of the austerity.

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 

On April 17, the Brazilian lower house of Congress voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff, who was elected in 2010 and reelected at the end of 2014. It was a garish spectacle, with one right-wing deputy dedicating his vote to the colonel who headed a torture unit during the dictatorship. One of its torture victims was the president herself.
The deputy's dedication was a grim reminder that Brazil emerged from dictatorship just 30 years ago, and that its democracy is perhaps less developed than many people assume. More reminders would soon spring forth like mushrooms in a rain-soaked field. Leaked telephone transcripts revealed that leaders of the impeachment effort were trying to remove Rousseff in order to stop the investigation into their own corruption. This led to the resignation of three ministers in the new Cabinet appointed by the interim president, Michel Temer; but 15 of the original 23 ministers he appointed were reportedly under investigation, as well as the majority of the Congress itself.
Then on June 2, Temer himself was convicted of campaign finance violations and banned from seeking office for eight years. New scandals involving interim and pro-impeachment officials emerged nearly every week.
Although there is corruption within all the parties, including Rousseff's Workers' Party (PT), the deep irony is that the corrupt officials trying to topple her presidency have not presented any charges or evidence of corrupt practices on her part. Rather, she is being impeached for an accounting practice that other presidents, and many governors, have used. And on July 14, the federal prosecutor assigned to the case concluded that it was not even a crime.

The neoliberal reforms it has imposed on countries around the world have been disastrous.
By Mark Weisbrot
Yesterday 12:55 pm
 
The UK's vote in June to leave the European Union, combined with an extraordinary backlash against trade agreements as manifested in the US presidential election, has set off an unprecedented public debate about globalization and even some of the neoliberal principles that it embodies in its current form. It is therefore of great relevance to look at what is happening to one of the most powerful promoters of neoliberal globalization in the world economy: the International Monetary Fund.
An article in the June issue of the IMF's quarterly magazine, Finance and Development, raised a lot of eyebrows in Washington policy circles. ""Neoliberalism: Oversold?"" was the title, and the authors presented some evidence in the affirmative, for at least some important neoliberal policies. To most of us, it was like an op-ed from Donald Trump titled ""Insulting Your Opponents: Oversold?""
Neoliberalism refers to a set of policies that the IMF has been promoting all over the world for decades. These include tighter fiscal and monetary policies (sometimes even when the economy is weak or in recession); an indiscriminate opening up of countries to international trade and capital flows; the abandonment of state-led industrial and development policies; privatization of public enterprises; and various forms of deregulation, including financial.

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 
How much is President Obama willing to harm the Democratic Party in order to win approval for the deeply unpopular Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) ""trade"" agreement? We may soon find out.
On Tuesday, Politico broke the story that the White House will be ""making an all-out push to win passage of the deal in the lame duck session of Congress, organizing 30 events over the congressional recess."" The effort will be designed to put pressure not only on Democratic members of Congress, but also on swing Republican votes, by lobbying important business interests in their districts.
This is pretty big news for the 2016 elections, but it seems to have gotten little to no coverage in major media outlets. The TPP has become a major issue in these elections, with GOP nominee Donald Trump highlighting his opposition, and Hillary Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton — who had previously supported the agreement — vowing to oppose it ""before and after"" the election. (Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her former rival for the Democratic nomination, also had a major impact on the debate during the primary season, and possibly on Clinton's change of position). This agreement is especially despised among the white working-class voters who have made up the major swing vote in most of the presidential elections of the past four decades.

    Written by Mark Weisbrot 
    Published: 01 August 2016 
In an interview with journalist Abby Martin, President Rafael Correa of Ecuador said that Latin America would be better off if Trump won the US presidential election in November. He was relatively gracious and diplomatic about it, praising Hillary Clinton for her positive attributes, and ended by saying that for the sake of the US and the world, he hoped that she would win. But Correa, who has done a great job in improving the lives of his compatriots and carrying out progressive reforms during his presidency, is highly educated and intelligent. He has learned much from the region's experience with the Bush and Obama administrations. So it is worth taking his claim seriously, because it says some important things about US policy in Latin America.
The basic idea is that the US is going to play a terrible role in Latin America no matter who is president, so it is better for Latin Americans to have a US president who is widely disliked, like George W. Bush was, than someone who is charming and mediagenic like President Obama. In the short run, it is hard to counter this claim. In fact, it is quite possible that the region would have been better off if John McCain (2008) or Mitt Romney (2012) had defeated Barack Obama, and Obama is in general less hawkish than Hillary on foreign policy. The Obama administration's policies in Latin America were no better than those of George W. Bush. The administration helped consolidate the military coup in Honduras, and did the same for the parliamentary coup in Paraguay.

12350395521_10154378912875522,"""The Republican Party, as many observers have noted, is facing the prospect of a long-term decline as a national political party. Since 1992, they have lost four out of the last six presidential elections. And of the other two, in 2000 they lost the popular vote (and quite possibly the electoral vote too if Florida had been accurately tallied); in 2004 they won with just 50.7 percent of the vote.

""My own view is that Trump will very likely continue this losing streak. But leaving that aside for now, there is no doubt that the Republicans face serious structural problems at the national level. These include changing demographics (their base is overwhelmingly white); the increasing unpopularity of their core ideas; the long-term failure of their economic policies (including some that continued to be advanced and implemented during the Bill Clinton era); the extremism of their electoral base, which makes it more difficult for the party to choose a presidential candidate that can possibly win the general election; and increasing divisions, including along class lines, within the party (which we can see in the Trump insurgency).

""What, then, appears to be the strategy for a declining political party in the Republicans' situation? It is clear that there are two major elements that have come to the fore in recent years. One is voter suppression, i.e., to reduce the number of voters with a bias toward keeping likely Democratic voters away from the polls. The array of ""voter identification"" laws passed in recent years is an attempt to reduce turnout: for example, the 2011 law in Wisconsin that requires voters to present government-issued identification in order to vote. It is pretty well established that these laws have nothing to do with preventing fraud. Indeed, the Wisconsin law was originally thrown out by the courts for this reason, only to be reinstated on appeal. (Friday's decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, invalidating a voter identification requirement in North Carolina, could be a significant blow to the national voter suppression effort.)""",Is The Republican Party a Legitimate Political Party?,link,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-weisbrot/is-the-republican-party-a_b_11270450.html,2016-08-01 13:42:24,15,2,4,15,0,0,0,0,0

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 

Donald Trump is a buffoon, a narcissist and misogynist who has offended large segments of the American population with racist comments. He has so little impulse control that he erupted with a pathetic defense of the size of his penis in the middle of a presidential debate, and retweeted an unflattering picture of former rival Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) wife next to his own wife. At that point many doubted whether this ""man baby"" — as Jon Stewart called him — with an eighth-grade mentality could get much further without self-destructing. But he did.
With all this foul baggage and unpopular political positions on many issues, you have to wonder why so many liberals would insist on trying to discredit Trump, the GOP nominee, for the few things he says that are arguably true or sensible. At least presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was smart enough to try and take the ""trade"" issue away from him — thanks largely to Sen. Bernie Sanders's (Vt.) Democratic primary campaign — by changing her position and opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (although her delegates fought to keep this opposition out of the Democratic platform).
Since last week, Trump has come under heavy fire his response to a question as to whether he would ""come to their immediate military aid"" if NATO members including Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia, were attacked by Russia. He said yes, but only ""if they fulfill their obligations to us."" He asserted that he wants Europeans to pay for their own defense. Imagine that! I'm sure that the white working-class voters who will, as in most of the presidential elections of the past half-century, make up the swing voters this year will recoil in horror at this idea.

Deborah James
The Huffington Post, July 22, 2016

In the realm of institutions that govern the global economy, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) stands out. While the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and others adhere to a rigid ""neoliberal"" ideology that favors deregulation, privatization, and the interests of the global North and the private sector over the poor, UNCTAD has a rich history of favoring people-centered development, promoting interests of the global South, and being a voice of the poor majority in international forums. It has been a strong critic of finance-led globalization and has played a unique role thanks to its focus on the interdependence of trade, finance, investment, macroeconomics, and technology as they affect the growth and development prospects of developing countries.
Every four years, member states meet to decide on the mandate of the organization's work plan for the next four years. And each time (as we wrote four years ago here), rich countries try to erode the development mandate of the organization, and transform it instead into an institution focused on simply building capacity for developing countries to implement trade (and investment) agreements negotiated elsewhere — whether or not those agreements actually function in the interests of development.With regard to each of the main areas of work, on trade, investment, debt, and tax, as well as other related issues, this week in Nairobi, Kenya, at the 14th UNCTAD was no different. The group of more than 100 developing countries united together in the G77 waged a heroic battle, and won on several important fronts, despite the arrogant negotiation tactics and antidevelopment positions of the rich countries. http://ow.ly/5tRF302AjQo",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ceprDC/photos/a.183938150521.155174.12350395521/10154359774880522/?type=3,2016-07-25 13:05:12,9,0,3,9,0,0,0,0,0

Confidence and the Degradation of Brazil 
By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 

For the first time in more than two decades, since the dictatorship, Brazil has a government that is widely seen as illegitimate. It is seen this way, not only by its citizens, but in much of the world. Its image is sullied, deteriorating by the week, with mounting scandals engulfing the highest levels of government. In June, the third minister of the interim government resigned amid charges of corruption. Inconveniently, it was the minister of tourism, as the country faces calls by international public health experts for moving the Olympics due to the Zika virus.

And then there is the interim president, Michel Temer (the vice president who is serving during President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment trial), who had the ""unifying"" political acumen to appoint a cabinet of all rich white men (in a country where half the population identifies as Afro-Brazilian or mixed race). Fifteen out of 23 of these officials are under investigation. Last month, he was himself directly implicated in a corruption scandal. He had previously been barred from running for office for eight years because of violations of campaign financing laws. These are the people who are trying to depose the elected president, not for corruption, but for an accounting mechanism that previous governments also used.
It's true that all major political parties have been implicated in corruption. But President Rousseff, for the first time in Brazil's history, gave prosecutors that authority to go after corrupt officials, letting the chips fall where they may. It has now become clear that her opposition's main purpose in impeaching her is to impede the investigations and prosecutions of themselves and their allies. http://ow.ly/uvOj302tUb3","Amid political upheaval, is Brazil facing long-term economic decline?",link,http://ow.ly/uvOj302tUb3,2016-07-21 15:05:07,7,0,8,7,0,0,0,0,0

    Published: 19 July 2016 
An immense effort was made to remove Bill Clinton from the presidency in the late 1990s, culminating in the first impeachment trial of a US president in 131 years. Intimate details of his affair with Monica Lewinsky, about which Clinton was accused of lying under oath, were probed and published by the far-right prosecutor Ken Starr. This let loose a flood of jokes and salacious fodder for the tabloids. At one point it seemed as if the question of perjury might hinge on what constitutes ""sexual relations""; whereupon the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association decided to publish an article based on survey data showing that 59 percent of college students did not consider oral sex as having ""had sex."" He was promptly fired, after 17 years at the helm of the prestigious medical journal — although some maintained that his overseers were taking advantage of the political situation to get rid of someone who had also published articles favoring universal, single payer health care and other things not dear to the hearts of the AMA.
The current attempt to remove President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil bears many resemblances to the Clinton impeachment episode. It is led by a group of politicians who seek to overturn the results of national elections and steer the nation in a different, right-wing direction; and the elected president has not committed an impeachable offense. Missing, of course, is the sex scandal — and the charges are so unsexy that most people don't even know what the president is being impeached for, and it's not that easy to figure it out. http://ow.ly/Unf7302qMn6",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ceprDC/photos/a.183938150521.155174.12350395521/10154346344985522/?type=3,2016-07-20 09:25:09,26,1,6,24,2,0,0,0,0

Rich Countries Work to Undermine Mandate UN's Premier ""Trade for Development"" Agency at 14th Conference of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
What if there were a United Nations agency that could assist developing countries in using trade for their own development purposes, while helping them advocate for a more fair and sustainable trading system? That could advocate for more fair and just international tax and debt systems? That had specialist divisions working to support Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the developmental challenges of Africa, among other regions? That could use integrated approach to the evolution and management of globalization, regarding the interdependence of trade, finance, investment and technology as they affect the growth and development prospects of developing countries, rather than assuming that trade occurs in a global policy vacuum?
Such an agency exists: the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Every four years, it holds a conference to debate these issues and to set the mandate of the work of the agency for the next quadrennial. Unfortunately, every four years, some rich countries push to turn it into an agency for implementing corporate trade agreements negotiated elsewhere, and to keep the agency on the sidelines of global debates and rule-setting (dominated by developed countries) on tax, debt, fiscal and macroeconomic policies, technology, and other key issues.

Even many supporters of the referendum seemed surprise, having prepared post-election speeches explaining their defeat and pledging to fight on. While it appears there are still same ways that the Brexit may be prevented, the vote clearly expressed an enormous amount of discount with the status quo.
Many commentators have focused on racism and xenophobia as major factors in the move to leave the EU. Undoubtedly these were important considerations. Many people in England, especially older ones, are uncomfortable with the country becoming more diverse. They fear and resent the people coming in from the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and elsewhere.
But racism and xenophobia are not new for the United Kingdom. What is new is that these forces are powerful enough to force the country to break with a political union it joined more than four decades ago.

The difference is driven predominantly by a large decrease in energy prices, which have fallen 9.4 percent over the past year. (Food prices are up 0.3 percent.)
This 2.2 percent core inflation rate is basically in line with the Fed's 2 percent target, though it should be noted that the 2.2 percent rate is driven predominantly by rising shelter costs, which can also be somewhat volatile. Shelter costs are up 3.5 percent relative to June of last year, while the costs of housing at school (consisting largely of college students' housing) are up 3.1 percent. Excluding food, energy, and shelter, prices are up just 1.4 percent relative to June of last year.
It is also telling that inflation is running above 1.0 percent in just one region of the country. Comparing the most recent three months to the same three months from 2015, prices are up 0.8 percent in the South and Midwest and just 0.9 percent in the Northeast. The overall inflation rate is only pulled up to 1.1 percent thanks to higher inflation in the West, where prices have risen 1.6 percent over the past year.

    Published: 14 July 2016 
Bloomberg is really pushing the frontiers in journalism. In order to give readers a balanced account of a proposal by Representative Peter DeFazio to impose a 0.03 percent tax on financial transactions (that's 3 cents on every hundred dollars) it went to the spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, the chief investment officer from Vanguard, and an academic with extensive ties to the financial industry. It also presented an assertion on the savings from electronic trading from Markit Ltd. Based on this diverse range of sources, Bloomberg ran a headline:
""Democrats assail Wall Street with plan that may hit mom and pop.""
If Bloomberg was interested in views other than those from the financial industry, it might have found some people who supported the tax to provide comments for the article. Or, it might have tried some basic arithmetic itself.
Most research finds that trading is price elastic, meaning that the percentage change in trading in response to a tax is larger than the percentage increase in trading costs that result from the tax. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center assumed an elasticity of -1.25 in its analysis of financial transactions taxes.

July 13, 2016
I will make two quick points on the financial transactions tax (FTT) proposed by Representative DeFazio in his bill, ""Putting Main Street FIRST: Finishing Irresponsible Reckless Speculative Trading Act."" Since they are really the same point, I will be very quick.
First, ordinary investors will not pay this tax.
Second, the tax will raise a great deal of revenue by making the financial sector more efficient.
The first point is a simple one. Most research indicates that the volume of trading will fall by a larger percentage than the increase in trading costs from the tax. In its analysis of a financial transactions tax, the non-partisan Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution assumed that the reduction in trading volume would be 25 percent larger than the increase in trading costs resulting from a FTT. This means that if a FTT raised trading costs by 10 percent, then the reduction in the volume of trading would be roughly 12.5 percent.

    Written by Mark Weisbrot 
    Published: 12 July 2016 
Some press reports on the crisis in Brazil seem to imply that the removal of President Dilma Rousseff, re-elected in 2014 for a four-year term, is a done deal. Of course the interim government is acting as though they are the product of some huge electoral victory, even though the elected president is merely suspended pending her upcoming impeachment trial in the Senate. Beginning with a cabinet of all rich, white males, in a country where more than half identify as Afro-Brazilian or mixed race descent, they have tried to create the impression that they are the new government that will rule at least until there are new presidential elections in 2018. But the chances that they will be gone before September are increasing every day.
First there were the series of scandals, which have so far resulted in the resignation of three ministers, and revealed that the main impetus behind the impeachment of Dilma was to protect corrupt, pro-impeachment politicians from further investigation. Then last week the speaker of Brazil's House of Representatives had to resign from his position because of corruption that reportedly netted him more than $40 million, including millions in Swiss bank accounts. (He has not resigned from his seat in Congress, despite an order from the Supreme Court to do so in order to stand trial. Members of Congress have immunity from normal prosecution and can only be tried by the Supreme Court; this is one of the unfortunate structural reasons why a majority of legislators are under investigation for a range of crimes).

Mark Weisbrot Co-Director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.
Luis Almagro, the current Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) has abused his position and authority more flagrantly and outrageously than any predecessor in recent years. In his lack of judgment and disregard for political and diplomatic norms he resembles Donald Trump. And like Trump, he is increasingly seen as an embarrassment within the organization for which he is the standard bearer.
The OAS has been manipulated by Washington many times over the years in the service of regime change. Twenty-first century examples include Haiti (2000-2004, and 2011), Honduras (2009), and Paraguay (2012). It was in response to Washington's manipulation of the OAS, in the process of consolidating the 2009 military coup in Honduras, that the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) was formed. It includes all countries in the hemisphere except the United States and Canada.
But in these other cases, Washington had to pretend it was doing something other than carrying out a political campaign against a sovereign government. Almagro is much more brazen. Like the communists of Karl Marx's time, he ""disdains to conceal his views."" He is a radical and seeks to win his goals by any means necessary.

Monday, 11 July 2016 00:00 By Dean Baker, Truthout | Op-Ed
Tens of thousands demonstrate against Britain's vote to leave the European Union in central London, July 2, 2016. (Andrew Testa / The New York Times)Tens of thousands demonstrate against Britain's vote to leave the European Union in central London, July 2, 2016. (Andrew Testa / The New York Times)
The vote in the UK to leave the European Union (EU) has set off a race among major European financial centers like Paris, Frankfurt and Milan to capture much of the financial industry that is now located in London. As a result of EU rules, it will be difficult to conduct many of the transactions which now take place in London if the UK is no longer part of the EU. This means that a large part of London's financial industry will soon be looking for a new home.
While the temptation to pull in an industry with a large number of high-paying jobs (some very high paying) is understandable, a larger financial sector will not necessarily be a boon to the winner's economy. It is worth thinking more carefully about what the financial industry is.
To some extent the financial sector fills the textbook role of transferring money from households who want to save to businesses, governments and individuals who want to borrow. This is a necessary and important economic function. If a country can win more of this business, both to meet its own needs and those of other EU countries, it will clearly benefit in the same way that it would benefit from having a larger tech or manufacturing sector.
But the modern financial industry goes well beyond the story of bankers lending money to businesses and homebuyers. (Read more: http://ow.ly/bRJt3028f1m)",Right-Sizing the Financial Sector in Post-Brexit Europe,link,http://ow.ly/bRJt3028f1m),2016-07-11 13:15:14,4,0,1,3,1,0,0,0,0

Dismayed by the decision to rerun controversial and fraud-plagued presidential elections, the US State Department announced on Thursday a suspension of electoral assistance to Haiti. State Department spokesperson John Kirby said the decision was communicated to Haitian authorities last week, noting that the US ""has provided over $30 million in assistance"" for elections and that the move would allow the US ""to maintain priority assistance"" for ongoing projects.
Kirby added that ""I don't have a dollar figure in terms of this because it wasn't funded, it wasn't budgeted."" However multiple sources have confirmed that the U.S has withdrawn nearly $2 million already in a United Nations controlled fund for elections. Donor governments, as well as the Haitian state, had contributed to the fund. Prior to the US move, $8.2 million remained for elections.
The pulling of funds indicates the growing displeasure with Haitian authorities' decision to rerun last year's presidential elections.
""We've made no bones about the fact that we had concerns about the way the process was unfolding,"" Kirby told reporters on Thursday. During a July 4 address, US Ambassador to Haiti Peter Mulrean was even clearer: ""We had difficulty understanding the decision … to start the presidential election from scratch.""

The insurgent candidacies of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and real estate mogul Donald Trump in the Democratic and Republican primaries, respectively — one uplifting and the other disturbing — together with the Brexit vote, have brought forth an unusual outpouring of discussion on the weaknesses of democratic governance in the high-income countries. There seems to be considerable agreement that all three of these unanticipated political earthquakes of 2016 are driven by discontent with a ""democratic deficit."" In the next few days and weeks, we will have a rare opportunity to see, close-up and raw, a historic effort to reduce that deficit.
The venue is the Democratic Party platform committee and the main event is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). If that sounds like inside baseball, it could easily become the World Series of this year's presidential race. And if presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is smart, she will reconsider her bet.
The TPP, a commercial agreement among 12 countries with 40 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP), is strongly disliked by the base of the Democratic Party, as well as by a sizable majority of Democratic voters and the general public.

There is a Mafia-like quality to the threats emanating from EU officials, who are acknowledged to be contemplating how much punishment they can mete out to the U.K. if the people should dare to vote the wrong way. ""Vote remain, and nobody gets hurt,"" so to speak. Or, as The New York Times headline yesterday put it, ""E.U. Countries Warn Britain on 'Brexit': You'll Pay if You Leave Us.""
It is reminiscent of the European authorities' threats, and ultimately the European Central Bank's shutdown of the Greek banking system, in the attempt to force Greeks to vote ""yes"" in a referendum last July 5 on further austerity. The defiant Greeks voted ""no"" with a 62 percent majority, but their government was subsequently beaten into submission.
So EU officials are demonstrating once again not only their contempt for democracy, but their shamelessness as extortionists.

    Written by Mark Weisbrot 
    Published: 13 June 2016 

I have argued for years, and in my last post on this blog, that a big part of the story we have seen in Europe over the past eight years is a result of social engineering. This has involved a major offensive by the European authorities, taking advantage of an economic crisis, to transform Europe into a different kind of society, with a smaller social safety net, lower median wages, and — whether intended or not — increasing inequality as a result.
In recent weeks France has faced strikes and protests as the battle has come to their terrain, over a new, sweeping labor law. Among other provisions, the law would weaken workers' protections regarding overtime pay, the length of the work week, and job security. But most damaging of all are the provisions that would structurally weaken unions and undermine their bargaining power. These would push collective bargaining away from the sectoral level, and toward the level of individual companies, thus making it more difficult for unions to establish industry standards for wages, hours, and working conditions.

    Written by Mark Weisbrot 
    Published: 03 June 2016 
The U.S. and one of its principal allies, OAS (Organization of American States) Secretary General Luís Almagro, suffered an unambiguous defeat this week at the OAS, when Almagro's attempt to use the hemispheric organization against Venezuela was rejected unanimously by the hemisphere. Almagro had used — a number of governments thought ""abused"" — his authority as Secretary General to convene the Permanent Council of the OAS in order to invoke the ""Democratic Charter"" of the OAS against Venezuela. The Charter allows the OAS to intervene when there is an ""unconstitutional alteration of the constitutional regime that seriously impairs the democratic order in a member state.""
With the exception of the right-wing government of Paraguay — itself installed in a 2012 coup that the U.S. used the OAS to help consolidate — there were no takers. The Permanent Council instead issued a statement that had, in sharp contrast to Almagro's efforts, a friendly tone; it included ""support for the initiative of the former presidents of Spain, the Dominican Republic, and Panama to reopen an effective dialogue between the government and the opposition."" The international media was gracious enough not to notice that Almagro had suffered a crushing defeat.

    Written by Mark Weisbrot 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has gotten some attention in the past week for the publication of an unusual article in its quarterly magazine, Finance and Development. The article's title, ""Neoliberalism: Oversold?"" itself is a shocker, since the institution has been the most influential proponent of neoliberalism in the world for more than four decades. It's kind of like an op-ed from Donald Trump titled, ""Insulting Your Opponents: Oversold?""
From the authors (Jonathan D. Ostry, Prakash Loungani, and Davide Furceri):
    ""[T]here are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected. Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country's borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called ""austerity,"" which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:
    • The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.­
    • The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.­
    • Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.­"" (Read more: http://ow.ly/932T300QYEQ )",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ceprDC/photos/a.183938150521.155174.12350395521/10154224583125522/?type=3,2016-06-02 12:45:13,62,4,34,62,0,0,0,0,0

By Dan Beeton and Ming Chun Tang
 

When former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sat down with the New York Daily News editorial board in April, she was asked what must have been a surprising and unwelcome question. In the years since the 2009 coup in Honduras, there has been remarkably little scrutiny in the major media of how Clinton's State Department handled it, and she has had to answer few questions about it.
But Juan González asked why she resisted cutting off aid to the coup regime and instead brokered a deal for new elections. Clinton controversially doubled down on defending the coup, outrageously suggesting that the oligarchs and generals who had forced President Manuel Zelaya out had a legal justification. Worse, she suggested that Honduras emulate Plan Colombia: the U.S.-funded war on drugs and guerrillas that sparked the biggest internal refugee crisis in the world outside of Syria, involved the deliberate killing of thousands of innocent civilians by Colombian armed forces, and fostered death squads now poised to stick around even as the country nears an end to its civil war.
Honduras also pops up in Clinton's memoir, ""Hard Choices."" The paperback edition, published shortly after she launched her presidential campaign, is roughly 100 pages shorter than the original hardcover edition, but some of the abridgments seem rather convenient. In her original account of the coup and its aftermath, which was entirely deleted from the paperback, Clinton openly admits to having intervened directly to prevent Zelaya from returning to office: (Read more: http://ow.ly/yjeU300LrAM )",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ceprDC/photos/a.183938150521.155174.12350395521/10154220052145522/?type=3,2016-05-31 11:45:13,39,4,36,34,0,0,0,1,4

    Written by Mark Weisbrot 
    Published: 26 May 2016 
It is clear that the executive branch of the U.S. government favors the coup underway in Brazil, even though they have been careful to avoid any explicit endorsement of it. Exhibit A was the meeting between Tom Shannon, the 3rd ranking U.S. State Department official and the one who is almost certainly in charge of handling this situation, with Senator Aloysio Nunes, one of the leaders of the impeachment in the Brazilian Senate, on April 20. By holding this meeting just three days after the Brazilian lower house voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff, Shannon was sending a signal to governments and diplomats throughout the region and the world that Washington is more than ok with the impeachment. Nunes returned the favor this week by leading an effort (he is chair of the Brazilian Senate Foreign Relations Committee) to suspend Venezuela from Mercosur, the South American trade bloc.
There is a lot at stake here for the major U.S. foreign policy institutions, which include the 17 intelligence agencies, State Department, Pentagon, White House National Security Council, and foreign policy committees of the Senate and House. An enormous geopolitical shift took place over the past 15 years, in which the Latin American left went from governing zero countries to a majority of the region. For various historical reasons, the left in Latin America tends to favor national independence and international solidarity, and is therefore less willing to go along with U.S. foreign policy. I remember the first time I saw Lula Da Silva. It was in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2002.

    Written by Mark Weisbrot 

The New York Times reported last week that Argentina's former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was indicted ""on charges of manipulating the nation's Central Bank during the final months of her administration."" Reading the article, however, as well as other media coverage, and even the 147-page court document, it is tough to figure out what actual violation of law is alleged here — either committed by Kirchner or her finance minister, Axel Kicillof, or her central bank president, Alejandro Vanoli, who are also charged. There is no allegation that any of them profited or received kickbacks from any transaction. Nor are there allegations that others connected with the defendants profited, or that there was any corruption involved. In other words, there is no crime here, and it seems very likely that the indictments will be thrown out by a higher court.
Many central banks intervene in foreign currency markets in order to influence the value of the country's currency. In this case, the Argentine Central Bank intervened by selling futures contracts (in pesos) between September and November of last year.  According to press reports, the average exchange rate for these contracts was 10.6 pesos per dollar. The official exchange rate during this time was about 9.5.  On December 10, 2015, the right-wing presidential candidate Mauricio Macri, of the opposition coalition Cambiemos (Let's Change), became president and soon lifted currency controls; the peso fell from 9.8 to 13.9 and is currently at about that value after falling further and recovering some. On this basis, the court accuses Kirchner et al of a crime, because the government would lose money — although in pesos, not dollars — in paying off the contracts before June.

This is how he earned the nickname ""Dr. Doom.""  There is much to agree and disagree with in his analysis. But I think there is some overreach here, and some overdeterminism.
One of these is a technical point, but it's important. Roubini writes:
    ""Moreover, a protracted cyclical slump can lead to lower trend growth. Economists call this 'hysteresis': Long-term unemployment erodes workers' skills and human capital; and, because innovation is embedded in new capital goods, low investment leads to permanently lower productivity growth.""
This is true, and it is one of the most tragic results of the European authorities' forced austerity and unnecessary prolongation of financial crisis (from 2010 through most of 2012). This is what gave Spain the 20 percent unemployment and 45 percent youth unemployment that it still has today, and even worse unemployment for Greece. Because of very bad policy choices, driven in large part by a political agenda, Europe has an unemployment rate today that is twice the level of the United States.
But as for ""permanently lower productivity growth,"" there is still a question of how much lower and how permanent?  The IMF forecasts that Spain will have unemployment of 16.4 percent in 2019; at the same time, the Fund estimates that Spain will be above its potential GDP in 2019. This means that Spain will have reached ""full employment"" with more than 16 percent of its labor force unemployed. Similarly, the IMF projects Greece to have unemployment of 18.9 percent in 2020; but the economy will be running at just 1.2 percent below its potential GDP.

It goes something like this: A commodities boom, led by demand from China for Latin American raw materials exports, fueled regional economic growth in the 2000s. This happened to coincide with the election of left governments that were reelected after spending lavishly on handouts to the poor. They alienated foreign investors and their economic policies were unsustainable. Now Chinese growth has slowed, commodity prices have gone south, and with them the fortunes of Latin America's nationalist, populist left. November's election of right-wing challenger Mauricio Macri as president of Argentina, the Venezuelan opposition's landslide congressional win in December, and economic and political crisis in Brazil—including the current effort to remove President Dilma Rousseff—herald the beginning of the end of an era. In this view, the region will continue to elect more right-wing—or, in business-press parlance, ""moderate"" (and pro-US)—governments that will return to some of the more sensible economic policies of their predecessors.

    Written by Ming Chun Tang 
    Published: 05 May 2016 
As ThePressProject reported in March, a memo in Hillary Clinton's declassified emails reveals that the German government had been preparing for the possibility of the anti-austerity Syriza party being elected in Greece as early as May 2012. The memo, viewable through WikiLeaks' Clinton email archive, illustrates the concern with which German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble viewed the prospect of a Greek exit from the eurozone (a ""Grexit"") ahead of the June 2012 legislative election. Questioning Syriza's commitment to the euro, Schäuble laid out two contingency plans to manage the scenario, neither of which would be favorable for Germany.
According to the memo, Schäuble and ""other financial officials in Berlin, London, and Brussels"" increasingly viewed the elections as a ""plebiscite on whether or not Greece wants to remain in the Euro-zone"" despite Syriza's insistence on keeping Greece in the eurozone if elected. Schäuble, seeking to avoid a Grexit at all costs, proposed that Greek voters should ""bear the consequences of their actions"" if they ever elected a Syriza-led government. This was because Germany's two options in the event of a Grexit would consist of either a ""European Redemption Pact,"" which the Merkel administration had long vehemently opposed, or a drastic shrinkage of the eurozone to expel every member with a budget deficit.

By Mark Weisbrot, contributor
 Venezuela has stepped up its campaign to remove President Nicolás Maduro from office, having announced — in accordance with its numerous divisions — that it would pursue a three-pronged strategy: a constitutional amendment to shorten the president's term of office; a recall referendum, as permitted under the constitution; and ""protests."" The first tactic was struck down by Venezuela's Supreme Court, as it would be in any country — you can't change the legal term of a president who was already elected for a certain number of years. For the recall referendum, the process of gathering signatures is under way.
The government, meanwhile, clearly needs to fix the economy if it is to regain popularity. The opposition, which has a large majority in the national legislature, has made it clear that it will not cooperate in any such efforts. On the contrary, it has acted to block the government from spending money.
But there is quite a bit that the executive branch can do to fix the economy even without the cooperation of the legislature. For some years now, I have emphasized that the exchange-rate system is the most important problem, and this is something that can be fixed rather quickly. The country currently has two official exchange rates: one at 10 bolivares fuertes (bs) per dollar (called DIPRO), and another which is currently at about 370 bs per dollar (DICOM). The latter rate is supposed to be a floating exchange rate, but this is not practical since the vast majority of the government's dollars are given away at the official rate of 10, and so there is very little to supply the DICOM market. Then there is the black-market rate, which is currently over 1,100 bs per dollar.

The proposal has a number of important features, but the main point is to make the Fed more accountable to democratically elected officials and to reduce the power of the banking industry in monetary policy.
Under its current structure, the banks largely control the 12 Federal Reserve district banks. This matters because the presidents of these banks are part of the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee (FOMC) which determines monetary policy. At any point in time, five of 12 district bank presidents will be voting members of the FOMC, but all 12 take part in the discussion. The voting presidents will typically be outnumbered by the seven Federal Reserve Board governors, who are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate, although there have been just five sitting governors for the last two years, as the Senate has refused to consider President Obama's nominees.
There is no obvious reason why the banking industry should have special input into the country's monetary policy. This would be comparable to reserving seats on the Federal Communications Commission's board for the cable television industry. While there is no way to prevent an industry group from trying to influence a government regulatory body, in all other cases, they at least must do so from the outside.

He had scheduled meetings with a number of U.S. officials, including Thomas Shannon at the State Department.
Shannon has a relatively low profile in the media, but he is the number three official in the U.S. State Department. Even more significantly in this case, he is the most influential person in the State Department on U.S. policy in Latin America. He will be the one recommending to Secretary of State John Kerry what the U.S. should do as the ongoing efforts to remove President Dilma Rousseff proceed.
Shannon's willingness to meet with Nunes just days after the impeachment vote sends a powerful signal that Washington is on board with the opposition in this venture. How do we know this? Very simply, Shannon did not have to have this meeting. If he wanted to show that Washington was neutral in this fierce and deeply polarizing political conflict, he would not have a meeting with high-profile protagonists on either side, especially at this particular moment.
Shannon's meeting with Nunes is an example of what could be called ""dog-whistle diplomacy."" It barely shows up on the radar of the media reporting on the conflict, and therefore is unlikely to generate backlash. But all the major actors know exactly what it means.

New Issue Brief Shows that US Veto Power and Alliance of High-Income Countries Effectively Exclude World's Majority
April 15, 2016

Washington, D.C. - A new issue brief from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) shows that despite recent changes in voting shares, the U.S. and Europe continue to maintain control of decisions at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The brief, ""Voting Share Reform at the IMF: Will it Make a Difference?"" examines reforms to IMF governance enacted earlier this year and finds that with 16.73 percent of votes, the U.S. dwarfs all other member countries' voting shares, both before and after the latest changes, and that outside of Brazil, Russia, India and China, voting shares for the rest of the developing world have actually decreased by 3 percentage points.
""The shift of 2.35 percentage points to China is far too small to make any significant difference in how the organization is run,"" CEPR Co-Director, and co-author of the brief, Mark Weisbrot said today. ""Also, the U.S. importantly still has veto power over an array of major decisions.
""The IMF will continue to be dominated by the finance ministries of the rich countries, with U.S. Treasury at the top, and the governments of the vast majority of the world's people will have very little say.""
The paper notes that this power imbalance can lead to damaging policies implemented in developing countries. For example, a review of 41 countries with IMF agreements during the world recession of 2009 found that 31 of the agreements contained pro-cyclical fiscal, monetary — or both — policy conditionalities [i.e., policies that could be expected to slow an economy that was already weakening or in recession].

New Issue Brief Finds that IMF's Flawed Estimates May Have Negative Effect on Policy in Eurozone and Elsewhere
April 14, 2016

Washington, D.C.- A new issue brief from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) finds that the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) flawed estimates for potential GDP may contribute to mal-informed policy decisions in countries such as Greece and Spain. The paper, ""Potential for Trouble: The IMF's Estimates of Potential GDP,"" by economist David Rosnick, describes several instances in which the Fund's faulty estimates may have led to policymakers acting on bad information.
""This research examines another area in which trust in the IMF may be misplaced,"" CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot said today. ""The IMF clearly failed as an economic watchdog when it missed the two biggest asset bubbles in history. It also appears that the IMF is not taking its own process for estimating potential GDP seriously – and this technical failing has some important real world implications, especially for employment.""
The paper notes: ""There is no consistent methodology for estimating potential GDP"" at the IMF. According to the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office, ""in the Fund's medium-term forecasting the use of any particular individual forecasting method is much less universal than the use of judgment."" Further, the paper explains, ""Even in data-rich Europe only half of IMF economists used any statistical method to produce their forecasts.""

This often happens when there is an attempted coup in the Western Hemisphere, and especially when the U.S. government has an interest in the outcome. Usually the information about that interest, and often Washington's role, is the first casualty of the conflict. (Twenty-first century examples include Paraguay in 2012, Haiti in 2011 and 2004, Honduras in 2009, Ecuador in 2010 and Venezuela in 2002.)
First, there is no doubt that this is a coup in progress. It is an attempt by Brazil's traditional elite — which includes, as one of the most important players, most of the major media — to reverse the outcome of Brazil's 2014 presidential elections. Exhibit A is the grounds on which they hope to impeach President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party (PT by its Portuguese initials). It has nothing to do with corruption or any serious offense. The charge is that the government used borrowed money in 2014 to maintain the appearance that the primary budget surplus was within its target. But this is something that other presidents had done, and is hardly an serious offense. A comparison: When the Republicans in the U.S. Congress threatened to shut down the government over the debt ceiling in 2013, the Obama administration used a number of accounting tricks to extend the deadline, and there was little controversy over this.
The charges against former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are also dubious, even if they turn out to be true. Most importantly, the accusers have not shown any connection to the big ""Lava Jato"" (car wash) corruption scandal — or any other corruption. Lula — as the former president is known — is accused of owning some beachfront property, which he denies owning, that was renovated by a Brazilian construction company; and of receiving money from various corporations for speeches.

Economic growth is stagnant, and millions of Haitians are facing food shortages after a series of droughts in the countryside.
By Jake Johnston / AlterNet
March 25, 2016 
More than a month after his selection as Haiti's provisional president, Jocelerme Privert finally has a government. His nomination for prime minister, and a 16 member cabinet, was approved by parliament in a marathon session that ended early this morning. It was a necessary first step in getting the delayed electoral process moving again, though no official date has been set.  But as the political crisis drags on, international actors are increasing the pressure on the provisional government, reducing aid just as the country needs it most.
Economic growth is stagnant, and millions of Haitians are facing food shortages after a series of droughts in the countryside. With inflation well in the double digits and a local currency that has lost 20 percent of its value in the last six months, many Haitians are scrambling to survive. But, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement, which could provide funds necessary to stabilize the economy and exchange rate, has stalled. Furthermore, support from the European Union and other donors is contingent upon the IMF agreement, leaving Haiti even worse off.
Newly installed Provisional President Jocelerme Privert has warned of an ""alarming and catastrophic"" economic situation, adding that the state has few resources to respond to the many humanitarian crises still plaguing the country. In a radio interview earlier this month, Privert stated that because of the IMF delays, ""all non-humanitarian funding is blocked."" 
In an e-mailed statement, the IMF said that disbursements had been delayed because ""the political transition in Haiti has taken longer than expected.""

Earlier in March, she was assassinated, one of at least three activists who have been murdered in connection with their efforts to protest the construction of this dam.
Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research has been following the fate of social and economic justice activists in the country since a 2009 coup deposed the democratically elected government of President Manuel Zelaya. And as it turns out, Weisbrot explains in this ""Burning Issues"" video segment, one of the 2016 presidential candidates played a key role in the coup and in the series of events that led to Cáceres' assassination.
Weisbrot notes that Hillary Clinton acknowledges in her book, ""Hard Choices,"" that when Zelaya was exiled to Costa Rica, she helped prevent Zelaya from returning to the country. That, Weisbrot explains, was crucial to allowing the forces behind the coup to consolidate their power in the face of international condemnation. (The Huffington Post reports that the section in the hardcover version of the book that addresses her support of the Honduras coup has been deleted from the paperback version. )
One of the consequences of the coup has been a series of assassinations of activists like Cáceres who have been protesting illegal or unjust actions by the government that, like the attempted construction of the Agua Zarca dam, have received international condemnation.
This is an example of the kind of regime change policy on which Clinton and her rival, Bernie Sanders, sharply disagree, Weisbrot says.",,status,,2016-03-25 12:25:12,18,0,12,12,0,0,0,1,5

The assassination of Berta Cáceres in the pre-dawn hours of March 3 came as a shock to Honduras and to Latin America watchers around the world. Berta, a vibrant woman with a glowing smile, was still young — and seemed too full of life, too driven and too determined, to be cut down.

But Berta's assassination one day before her 45th birthday, and just five days before International Women's Day, should have been expected. Berta had received numerous death threats in recent years, as she had explained to the many media outlets that interviewed her after she received the Goldman Environmental Prize last year. She had also been subject to a campaign of harassment and persecution by the Honduran authorities, including sedition and other bogus charges leveled at her in 2013 (subsequently dropped). Not yet the recipient of such a prestigious international award, she received little international attention for her plight then.

Berta was a threat to powerful forces in Honduras, and so they threatened her.

Vulture funds — the name preceded this particular dispute — are so called because they buy up defaulted debt for a very small fraction of its face value, then sue (and use other tactics) to collect an exorbitant return. In the case of Argentina, the chief vulture, American billionaire and major Republican campaign donor Paul Singer, will get an estimated 370 percent return; another vulture fund in the settlement did even better, with a return of 950 percent.

The agreement is tentative because President Mauricio Macri of Argentina still has to get the nation's Congress, in which he does not have a majority, to change some laws in order to finalize the deal. And he will also have to reach agreement with some remaining ""holdout"" creditors. And now the vulture funds are appealing the judge's order that would allow Argentina to issue new debt, presumably in an effort to extract even more concessions. Assuming it all works out, though, there are some important lessons to be learned from this long war over sovereign debt.

Argentina arguably had no alternative but to default in 2002, but the government also did the right thing by standing up to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its international creditors until it reached a deal (in 2003 and 2005) that would allow the economy to recover. International lenders — in this case, a creditors' cartel headed by the IMF — often succeed in getting a settlement that keeps the country trapped in recession, depression or very low growth with an unsustainable debt burden; the settlement also entails numerous conditions (cuts to social spending, public pensions, public employment) that harm the majority of the debtor country's citizens.

The potential move may represent a belated attempt by the Republican establishment to rally behind Rubio in order to derail Donald Trump's presidential bid, as Politico's Mike Allen has suggested. It also draws the Florida senator ever closer to his second largest financial backer – who has incidentally just emerged victorious from a decade-long campaign to extract an exorbitant return from Argentina after its financial crisis of 2001.

Almost three years after Argentina defied a New York court ruling that would have forced the country to choose between default and certain bankruptcy, Argentine President Mauricio Macri reached a settlement on Monday with a small group of holdout creditors led by Singer's Elliott Management. The deal still needs to be approved by the Argentine National Congress, which is set to vote on repealing two laws that currently prevent the country from paying these vulture funds.

Despite having already settled with 93 percent of its creditors through two debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010, paying them 30 percent of the face value of the debt, Argentina still faced Singer's group of vulture funds, who had no intention of settling under those terms. This week's settlement will see the country pay out $4.65 billion, amounting to 75 percent of principal and interest, to Singer and company.

The vulture funds' victory is the predictable outcome of a prolonged campaign aimed at extracting every dollar out of Argentina by all available means. Elliott Management used a Ghanaian court order to detain an Argentine navy ship in Ghana for 10 weeks in 2012. It has also channeled funds into American Task Force Argentina (ATFA), a lobby group pushing for the full repayment of Argentine debts.

Washington, D.C. – The assassination last night of Berta Cáceres, one of the most prominent and internationally known human rights and environment defenders in Honduras, must be condemned, and calls for an independent, international investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice, Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) Co-Director Mark Weisbrot said today. Cáceres, who was General Coordinator of the National Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), was reportedly murdered by gunmen who broke down the door of the house where she was staying and shot and killed her. They also wounded her brother, who was staying with her.

""Cáceres' murder represents an escalation in the targeting of human rights defenders and dissidents in Honduras,"" Weisbrot said. ""It is a tragic and disturbing development showing how vulnerable anyone in Honduras is, and demands a strong international response.

""The Obama administration must stop white-washing the human rights abuses being committed and perpetuated in near-total impunity in Honduras, and stop ignoring the involvement of U.S.-backed Honduran security forces in many of these abuses.""

Cáceres had received international recognition for her work to defend indigenous rights and the environment, including the Goldman Environmental Prize last year. She was also a prominent opponent of the coup d'état against the democratically elected government of President Manuel Zelaya in 2009.

For the first time in three decades, each of two major parties that had ruled Spain since its incomplete transition to democracy was unable to form a governing coalition. The incumbent right-wing Popular Party (PP)—with roots in Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship—remained the largest party in the parliament but saw its representation shrink by a third. The center-left Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), which had lost its majority to the PP in 2011 due to its support for austerity, fared even worse. Their defecting voters went mostly to Podemos (""We can""), a new left party, less than two years old, which grew out of the mass protests against austerity. Podemos surprised pollsters and most of the media by winning 20.7 percent of the vote, just 1.3 points behind the PSOE. The PP won 28.7 percent, and a new party called Ciudadanos (Citizens), which some have called ""the Podemos of the right,"" got 13.9 percent.

The political upheaval that broke up the two-party system in Spain is part of an ongoing process that has beleaguered European governments since the world recession of 2009. GDP for the nineteen countries of the Eurozone is estimated to have grown by 1.5 percent in 2015; some may have thought that such feeble economic recovery and the capitulation of the Greek government to European demands last July marked the beginning of a solution to Europe's economic malaise. This would still leave a host of other problems, both real and exaggerated: the migration crisis, terrorism, the UK's proposed referendum on EU membership. But the economic problem is at the core of most of the others, and it can make them considerably more difficult to resolve.

The White House has made approval of the 12-nation free-trade deal, which took seven years to negotiate, a top priority. But many in Congress and around the country have serious concerns about how it will affect everything from environmental regulations and drug prices to jobs and wages.

""Supporters of the trade deal were therefore pleased when a study from the venerable Peterson Institute for International Economics projected that the TPP would boost exports and economic growth. If ratified, by 2030, the U.S. economy would be 0.5 percentage point larger with the TPP than without it, according to the study. Annual exports would be $387 billion higher as a result of the deal.

""Unfortunately, a closer look at the study gives considerably less cause for celebration.

""The Peterson Institute didn't really investigate the central question of concern to U.S. politicians and voters: Will the TPP incite a wave of cheap imports that cost workers their jobs? The model of the global economy Peterson used, the study explains, 'assumes that the TPP will affect neither total employment nor the national savings (or equivalently trade balances) of countries.' So on the face of it, this paper doesn't appear to have much to say about the jobs situation.

""But if we dig further into its second assumption — that trade surpluses or deficits also are unchanged — something important gets revealed.

""For instance, the Peterson Institute promoted its finding that annual exports will increase by $387 billion. If the trade balance stays the same, that means imports will increase by $387 billion too.""

While these measures are a step forward, there is much more that needs to be done in order to stabilize the economy.

""Let's look at the numbers. The best estimates and forecasts for the Venezuelan economy have come from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BOA). Unlike the IMF, which was not even in the ballpark in their forecast for 2015 GDP, BOA was on target. (Using a statistical model, BOA even correctly forecast the December National Assembly election results.)

'BOA estimates that Venezuela has a public sector financing gap, which includes principal payments on the debt — of about $24 billion for 2016, and that about $5 billion will be covered by Chinese loans. Looking at the economy as a whole, the current account (mostly trade) deficit was about $18 billion last year. BofA also estimates that the government has about $60 billion in assets that it can sell for U.S. dollars, including its international reserves. So, the country is not broke yet — there is still at least another year to turn the economy around, or possibly more, depending on oil prices.

""So where should Venezuela go from here? Here are four measures the country could take to create a path toward economic recovery:

""Make living affordable

""The economy has large imbalances that will have to be adjusted. Therefore, the first thing to ensure is that poor and working Venezuelans do not suffer from the adjustment. This means setting up a system to make sure that food, medicine, and other essentials are available at affordable prices.

12350395521_10153921222700522,"CEPR Co-Director Dean Baker writes at Al Jazeera America: ""The business press has been obsessed in recent weeks over the volatility in financial markets around the world. Most major stock markets have dropped by more than 10 percent from their 2015 peaks. China's market is down by more than 40 percent from its peak last spring. Interest rates on high-risk bonds have soared and the price of oil has fallen by more than 70 percent from its levels two years ago.

""While these movements are dramatic, it is important to remember the financial markets are not the economy. Markets often take sharp turns in ways that have no obvious connection to the real economy. The best example of this is the 1987 stock market crash in which the U.S. markets lost more than 20 percent of their value in a single day. There was no obvious cause for this plunge nor did it have a noticeable effect on the economy. In fact, the U.S. economy continued to grow at a healthy pace for the next two and a half years.

""This doesn't mean that the U.S. and the world economy don't face real problems. It's just that these problems are not best captured by a deflating Chinese stock bubble and the response of worried investors elsewhere.

""The world economy suffers from pretty much the same problem it has faced since the collapse of the housing bubble threw the world economy into recession in 2008-2009: a lack of aggregate demand. Prior to the collapse of housing bubbles in the U.S., much of Europe, and elsewhere, the demand created by these bubbles drove growth.

""In the United States, residential construction reached a record share of GDP in 2005. In addition, there was a consumption boom driven by the bubble-generated housing equity from the bubble. At its peak, the bubble raised the value of residential real estate in the United States by more than $8 trillion above its trend level. Homeowners spent against this ephemeral equity, pushing saving rates to record lows."" Read the rest: http://alj.am/3rgq",,status,,2016-02-03 12:20:10,13,0,2,13,0,0,0,0,0

""Perhaps this is nowhere more true than in Haiti, where Washington has long exercised a veto over the country's most important decisions. But last week the 'international community' suffered a rare defeat when Haitians rejected Washington's plans for a deeply flawed presidential runoff election to take place on Sunday, Jan. 24.

""How did this happen? Basically, Haitians managed to put Washington in the situation of having to maintain that a runoff election with only one candidate, businessman Jovenel Moïse, would be legitimate, or postpone the election. As late as last Thursday, just three days before the election, U.S. officials were insisting that they would go forward even if the second candidate, engineer Jude Célestin, refused to participate. But he stuck to his boycott, and they backed down.

""Célestin was also the candidate who finished second in the first round of Haiti's 2010 presidential elections. But the 'international community' had a different choice, and brought in an 'expert' mission under the auspices of the Organization of American States to examine the results. Without a recount or even a statistical test of a ballot sample, it reversed the first-round results, eliminating Célestin and putting musician and businessman Michel Martelly into the runoff. Martelly went on to win the election and become president. Approaching the end of his five-year term, he is supporting Moïse as his replacement.""

Ever considered why the eurozone has ended up with an unemployment rate more than twice that of the United States, seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers? Or why the vast majority of low- and middle-income countries suffered a prolonged economic slowdown in the last two decades of the 20th century? These questions don't have much prominence in current presidential debates, but they are very relevant to some that do, including the current prospects for the U.S. economy and the global economic turbulence. They are examined in ""Failed.""

According to Weisbrot, understanding the recent history of economic policy failures – and successes – can provide many important lessons to presidential candidates and other policy makers. Weisbrot argues that many of the most important economic developments of recent years have been widely misunderstood—and in some cases almost completely ignored. He claims that the European authorities' political agenda, which has included shrinking the welfare state, reducing healthcare, pension and other social spending, and reducing the bargaining power of labor, played a very important role in prolonging the eurozone's financial crisis, additional years of recession, and current levels of mass unemployment.

This increase in imports will be equal to 1.4 percent of projected GDP in that year.

""You probably didn't see this projection in the write-ups of the analysis in the Washington Post, NYT, or elsewhere. That is likely because the study's authors chose not to highlight it. Instead, in their abstract they told readers that they projected the TPP would increase exports by $357 billion. If you were curious about what happened to imports you had to go to page 7 to find:

'The model assumes that the TPP will affect neither total employment nor the national savings (or equivalently trade balances) of countries.'

""In other words, by design the model assumes that trade balance for the United States is not changed as a result of the TPP. This means that whatever changes we see in exports, according to the model, will be matched by an equal change in imports. Unfortunately the implied projection for imports is never mentioned in the study, so some reporters may have missed this implication of the model.

""There are several other important issues that may have been missed. First, the model is quite explicitly a full employment model. This means that, by assumption, the model rules out the possibility of the TPP leading to a larger trade deficit that reduces output and increases unemployment.

""In prior decades most economists were comfortable with this sort of full employment assumption since it was widely believed that economies quickly bounced back from recessions or periods of less than full employment. In this view, if a trade agreement led to a larger trade deficit it would soon be offset by lower interest rates, which would provide a boost to investment and consumption.""

On the table is a deal that would delay this Sunday's elections until March and provide assurances on how to move forward. But speaking on local radio Thursday morning, current president Michel Martelly, who is constitutionally barred from running again, said everything was ready for the election Sunday and criticized groups who he said wanted to seize power by delaying elections.

""Less than 72 hours before polls are scheduled to open, it remains unclear if elections will take place or if a deal to re-schedule them can still be reached. Opposition parties have threatened to boycott the vote, alleging government interference and massive fraud in the October first round.

""On the line now is not just the next president of Haiti, but how and if president Martelly will leave office and whether he will peacefully transfer power to his successor.

""This unprecedented period of detente turned out to be little more than a head fake. As the summer ended, Washington reverted to the strategy that it has pursued for most of the past 17 years: regime change.

""The reason was obvious: Venezuela had elections for its National Assembly scheduled for Dec. 6, and the Obama administration wanted to do what it could to influence, discredit and delegitimize these elections.

""This was done primarily through an international public relations campaign that argued the elections would not be credible without monitors from the Organization of American States, who have long been heavily influenced by Washington.

""The campaign turned out to be mostly unnecessary: Venezuela's opposition won a two-thirds majority in the Assembly.

A Quinnipac poll released the same day showed Sanders had erased Clinton's lead in Iowa and was now ahead by 5 percentage points.

'On the standard political story, victories in Iowa and New Hampshire could provide momentum for Sanders and change the dynamics of the race. But the way in which this happens is also important for understanding the present situation. The Iowa caucuses will be held on Feb 1, just 18 days from now. New Hampshire Democrats will vote on February 9. The voters in these contests are the ones who have been paying the most attention to the candidates and to the issues.

""A lot of the media discussion on the global economy nowadays is based on the notion of the 'new normal' or 'new mediocre'—the phenomenon of slowing, stagnating or negative economic growth across most of the world. News in terms of employment generation is even worse, with hardly any creation of good quality jobs and growing material insecurity for the bulk of the people. All sorts of explanations are being proffered for this state of affairs, from technological progress, to slower population growth, to insufficient investment because of shifts in relative prices of capital and labour, to 'balance sheet recessions' created by the private debt overhang in many economies, to contractionary fiscal stances of governments that are also excessively indebted.

""Yet, these arguments that treat economic processes as the inevitable results of some forces outside the system that follow their own logic and are beyond social intervention are hugely misplaced. Most of all, they let economic policies off the hook, and this is massively important because the possibility of alternative strategies that would not result in the same outcomes are simply not considered.

""In an important new book (Failed: What the ""Experts"" Got Wrong About the Global Economy, Oxford University Press, New York, 2015), Mark Weisbrot calls this bluff effectively and comprehensively. He points out: 'Behind almost every prolonged economic malfeasance there is some combination of outworn bad ideas, incompetence and the malign influence of powerful special interests' (page 2).""

Five years later, as Haiti finds itself embroiled in another electoral crisis, the lasting impact of the 2010 election is clear for all to see. Unfortunately, these powerful actors, who have interfered in Haiti's politics throughout its brief democratic history, do not seem to have learned their lesson.  

""Haiti was not ready for an election in 2010. The elections took place less than a year after a devastating earthquake had killed hundreds of thousands and displaced more than a million – and just a month after a virulent cholera outbreak, introduced by U.N. soldiers, began its spread throughout the country. Furthermore, 14 legitimate political parties, including the popular Fanmi Lavalas party, were barred from participating in the elections without any real justification. But with billions in aid dollars on the table, the international community wanted new leadership in Haiti. Their investment could not be jeopardized. 

""The election was, as predicted, fatally flawed from the beginning, but rather than heeding to the warning from the U.S. Congress and from a myriad of actors in Haiti, the international community blindly marched forward. A U.S.-financed experts mission from the Organization of American States was sent to Haiti to evaluate the results. Without conducting a recount or using statistical analysis, it recommended changing the results of the election.

This is true not only for low-income workers, who have struggled most of their lives, but also for millions of middle-income workers. Although Social Security is a tremendously important program, and provides a solid base that retirees can depend upon, its $16,000 average annual benefit doesn't go very far. Many if not most can expect to see sharp reductions in living standards.

""The reason for such bleak retirement prospects is the disappearance of traditional defined benefit pensions and the failure of 401(k)-type plans to fill the gap. A recent analysis by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that, in 2011, only 14% of private-sector employees participated in a defined benefit pension plan. The participation rate has been falling quite rapidly, so it was almost certainly lower in 2015.

""Although many people were hopeful that 401(k)s would be sufficient to support a comfortable day-to-day retirement, this has proved not to be the case. In 2013, the middle fifth of households of people ages 45 to 54 had less than $60,000 in total financial assets. And most homeowners in this age group still had less than 40% equity in their homes, meaning they could look forward to paying off a mortgage well into their retirement.

""In response to this situation, Illinois is developing a state-run retirement program that will make it easier and cheaper for workers to save. Many other states, including California, are studying this option.

""Although there are differences in proposals, the common goal is to create a publicly managed system that will automatically include workers whose employers do not enroll them in a plan.""

The economic recovery that began in the second half of 2013 is not the result of austerity policies, and is unlikely to rescue Spain from mass unemployment in the foreseeable future, a new paper from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) concludes.

""The fiscal tightening mostly ended after 2013, and this — combined with favorable external factors and election year tax cuts — probably accounts for the recovery of economic growth,"" said Mark Weisbrot, CEPR Co-Director and co-author of the paper, ""Has Austerity Worked in Spain?"" ""The idea that austerity brought about recovery by increasing investor confidence seems to be no more true in Spain than anywhere else,"" he added.

A number of economists and officials have maintained that Spain's fiscal consolidation, despite the losses of output and huge declines in employment, has spurred economic recovery by restoring the confidence of markets, investors, and consumers in the Spanish economy.

The favorable external factors include lower interest rates, helped along by the ECB's quantitative easing, lower oil prices (which contributed to increased consumer spending), and a depreciating euro.

The authors also call attention to the European Union's estimate that net fiscal consolidation measures by the government for 2013-15 fell short of the target by 2.8 percentage points of GDP. (The target is set by the Excessive Deficit Procedure of the Stability and Growth Pact.) This differs from the Spanish government's estimates, and is another indication that the government's let-up on budget tightening could be a main cause of the recovery.

""It wouldn't be surprising to see more spending cuts after the election, depending on the outcome,"" said Weisbrot.

The paper, co-authored by economists David Rosnick and Mark Weisbrot, focuses on employment, contributions to GDP growth, and the current account balance to analyze the current recovery.

He continues: ""The point of this rate hike was to slow the economy out of the fear that it is creating too many jobs and that we could see too much upward pressure on wages. The Fed is concerned that more rapid wage growth would soon turn into higher inflation, which could then pose a problem if it spiraled upward. It is difficult to see the basis for this concern.

""At 5 percent, the unemployment rate is reasonably low, but most other measures of the labor market are near recession levels. The number of people involuntarily working part time soared during the recession. It has since fallen, but it is still near the highs reached following the 2001 recession.

""The story with measures of unemployment duration is the same. There are fewer long-term unemployed than in 2009 and 2010, but the length of unemployment spells is still close to what we see in a normal recession. Another standard measure of labor market strength is the percentage of workers who feel confident enough to quit their jobs without another job lined up. This measure also remains near the low points reached in 2002.

""One of the reasons unemployment has fallen so much in the recovery is that millions of people have dropped out of the labor force. If we look at employment rates rather than unemployment, the percentage of prime age workers (ages 25-54) with jobs is still down by almost three full percentage points from the pre-recession peak and by more than four full percentage points from the peak hit in 2000.

He argues that the Federal Reserve should not raise interest rates in part because blacks were the hardest hit during the 2001 and 2007 recessions, with recessions being more severe and lasting longer than for whites.

""Looking into the future, low rates will help the most marginalized and disadvantaged. For example, the gains from lower unemployment will disproportionately help black workers. History provides more reasons for keeping rates low: black workers were hit much harder than whites, Asians, or Hispanic/Latinos in both the 2001 and 2007 recessions. In addition, the incomplete recovery from the 2007 recession is on top of an incomplete recovery following the 2001 recession.""",FedWatch: The Last Two Recessions Have Hurt Blacks the Most,link,http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/fedwatch-the-last-two-recessions-have-hurt-blacks-the-most,2015-12-14 16:11:13,20,0,15,20,0,0,0,0,0

""When the Fed meets on December 15–16, it will consider raising rates despite the fact that the labor market by at least one key measure is only about halfway recovered from the 2007–2009 recession. Moreover, inflation is hardly a problem in today's economy. By all measures inflation is low, and projections of future inflation indicate that the Federal Reserve is likely to remain below its target rate of 2.0 percent.

So when the Fed votes on whether or not to raise interest rates next week, it will be choosing between reducing the risk of a potential future problem (inflation) and a very real present one (low employment).

First, an endless stream of news articles, newspaper editorials and proclamations — such as from the secretary general of the Organization of American States (OAS) — denouncing the Venezuelan electoral process and insisting on 'credible' election monitors (by which they meant OAS monitors beholden to Washington) were wrong. Quoting out-of-context remarks from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and adding other misleading statements, inaccuracies about 'gerrymandering,' and more, they created a fear that the government would not accept the results if it lost.

""But less than seven hours after the polls closed, the results were announced, and the president accepted them without qualification or hesitation, and with a certain pride — which many Venezuelans share — that their highly secure, safeguarded system worked. Maduro had also signed a pledge prior to the election to respect the results, and requested — unsuccessfully — for the opposition to do the same, as had often happened in the past.

""The opposition got their message out and their voters to the polls, which is not surprising, given the state of the economy and the resources of the opposition. They still have most of the wealth and income of the country, they get millions of dollars from the U.S. government and they receive a lot of media coverage, too.

The paper, ""Projecting a Range of Possible Results in the December 2015 Elections for National Assembly in Venezuela,"" by economist David Rosnick, finds that a wide range of outcomes are possible in the elections, based on current polling data and examines the impact of an inherent rural/small state advantage for the governing party coalition, and realigned party coalitions. The paper finds, for example, that a ""unified"" opposition might need as much as a 71.8 percent increase in votes over the 2010 elections — with the government losing 10.8 percent of its votes at the same time — to get a supermajority, leaving the current government with just 55 seats.

""Media reports have so far been based on national polling, without any explanation of the system of representation,"" said CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot. ""As a result, most people following the news would think that an opposition majority is inevitable, and a super-majority (60 percent or two-thirds) is likely. These results are possible, but by no means guaranteed, and we cannot even say how likely they are.""

The paper illustrates how the current government may benefit from a ""rural and small-state advantage"": ""It is important to understand that the difference between the percentage of the vote and the percentage of seats is not the result of 'gerrymandering' or any other manipulation of districts.

The European authorities who made this mess—the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)—known as 'the troika'—provide one of the clearest, large-scale demonstrations in modern times of the damage that can be done when people in high places get their basic macroeconomic policies wrong. That it has happened in a set of high-income economies with previously well-developed democratic institutions makes it even more compelling.

""It is necessary to say 'previously well-developed' democratic institutions because the eurozone countries surrendered their sovereign rights to control their most important macroeconomic policies: first monetary and exchange rate policy, and then increasingly fiscal policy for the so-called PIIGS countries (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). As we will see, this was a profound loss of democratic governance, and one for which tens of millions of eurozone residents would pay dearly in the years following the world financial crisis and recession of 2008–2009, and for as yet untold years to come.

With a preface by Ha-Joon Chang, the book has received acclaim from many prominent scholars and writers, including Noam Chomsky, James K. Galbraith, The Guardian's Larry Elliott, Jose Antonio Ocampo, Branko Milanovic, Sarah Babb, Gerald Epstein and Greg Grandin: 

""For those who wish to understand the global economy of the past generation, the shocking failures and impressive successes, this is the book to read. With careful scholarship and lucid analysis, Weisbrot reveals the pernicious effects of the neoliberal assault on the world's population, from wealthy and developed Europe to the global south, and exposes the dominant political-economic doctrines, rooted in a harsh attack on democracy and undermining of social policies that benefit the vast majority. He also shows how rejection of these doctrines has led to impressive achievements. All of this is consistent with actual economic history, if not prevailing illusion. The critique is harsh and incisive, but prospects are bright if the lessons of history and the logic of policy are viewed with care, as in this timely, authoritative, and very valuable study."" 
--Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor and Professor of Linguistics (Emeritus), MIT

""Mark Weisbrot demolishes the illusions of Europe and the IMF -- but also shows, by way of contrast, how it was that Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador have brewed success from rebellion against the neoliberal project.""
 --James K. Galbraith, author of The End of Normal: The Great Crisis and the Future of Growth and Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. Chair in Government/Business Relations at University of Texas-Austin

""In the past 13 years, Argentina made enormous economic and social progress. Under the Kirchners (first Néstor and then Cristina Fernández de Kirchner), poverty fell by about 70%, and extreme poverty fell by 80%. (This is for 2003 to mid-2013, the last year for which independent estimates are available; they are also based on independent estimates of inflation.) Unemployment fell from more than 17.2% to 6.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund.

""But Daniel Scioli—the candidate of the Peronist 'Front for Victory' party who represented the governing coalition, including President Fernández—did not do a good job defending these achievements. He also didn't seem to make clear what he would do to fix the country's current economic problems. In the past four years, growth has been slow (averaging about 1.1% percent), inflation has been high, and a black market for the dollar has developed. This gave Macri (and his 'Cambiemos,' or 'Let's Change' coalition) an opening to present himself as the candidate of a better future.

""With skilled marketing help from an Ecuadorean public relations firm, Macri defined himself as something far more moderate than he is likely to be, winning over voters who might otherwise be afraid of a return to the pre-Kirchner depression years.""

He was very concerned that Washington was 'too soft' on Argentina and was encouraging 'abusive treatment' of the U.S. at the hands of the Argentine government.

""The analogy is not perfect, since the current Russian government has never played a major role -- or any role, for that matter -- in wrecking the U.S. economy and creating a Great Depression here. But the U.S. Treasury Department, which was the IMF's decider during Argentina's severe depression of 1998-2002, did indeed exert an enormous influence on the policies that prolonged and deepened that depression.

12350395521_10153764636500522,"A leaked diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Argentina states that current presidential candidate Mauricio Macri accused U.S. officials of being ""too soft"" on the government of Argentina.

Reporting on a meeting between the U.S. Ambassador and Macri in November 2009, the cable, published by WikiLeaks, and previously analyzed in the book ""Argenleaks: Los cables de Wikileaks sobre la Argentina, de la A a la Z"" by Santiago O'Donnell, states:

    Macri reprised an earlier conversation with [the then Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, Thomas Shannon, the State Department's top official for Latin America] regarding the need to set limits on the Kirchners' misbehavior and the USG's supposed ""softness"" on the Kirchners. He argued that the USG's ""silence"" on the abusive mistreatment it suffered at the hands of the Kirchners (such as at the 2005 Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas) had encouraged more of the same.

The leaked conversations are likely to be noticed in a heated presidential race where Argentina's national sovereignty, especially with regard to Washington, has been raised as an issue. The Argentine economy was restructured in the 1990s and fell into a deep depression from 1998–2002, under the tutelage of the Washington-dominated International Monetary Fund. And last year a New York judge ruled in favor of ""vulture funds,"" blocking Argentina from paying its creditors. Many Argentines have become wary of U.S. influence as a result of these and other interventions from Washington that had negative outcomes.

""This would probably be a bombshell revelation in any country's presidential election,"" CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot said today. ""Asking a powerful foreign country, especially the U.S. – considering its track record in Argentina – to come down harder on your own government is not likely to be viewed positively.""

It's unfair that the work women do is valued less than the work men do, even when the work they do is substantially similar. It doesn't make sense that many women are discouraged from pursuing certain occupations at various points throughout their lives. It's ridiculous that in the 21st century there are still major areas of the economy, like science, technology, and finance that are male-dominated and plagued by overt sexism.

In addressing the underlying causes of these injustices, it's clear that American society and culture must change, in the way that we educate women, tolerate sexism in the workplace, and create a ""glass ceiling"" for women and consider only men as leaders.

""When a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010, killing more than 200,000 people, former President Bill Clinton said that the reconstruction would provide an opportunity to 'build back better.' Some $9.6 billion was pledged by the international community, including the U.S. government. But nearly six years later, although about $7.6 billion has been disbursed, there is not much to show for it.

""Hundreds of thousands of Haitians displaced by the earthquake remain without adequate shelter. USAID, the U.S. State Department's development agency, pledged to build 15,000 homes but has so far only delivered 900. Most U.S. taxpayers' money, it seems, didn't get outside of the Beltway. Of USAID contracts, for example, more than 50 percent of payments went to contractors in the Washington, D.C. area, while only 1 percent went directly to Haitian companies or organizations. Everyone worries about money being potentially lost to corruption in the Haitian government, and so just a small fraction of the billions pledged went to desperately needed budget support. But the large-scale corruption, fed by lack of accountability, is much closer to home.

""Haiti needs a government that can collect taxes, especially from the rich elite and companies that can pay them, and provide necessary services. This should have been the target of 'building back better,' rather than foreign contractors. But the U.S government has never shown much interest in building a democratic, legitimate government in Haiti; quite the opposite in fact. In 1991, Haiti's first democratically elected president, Jean Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown in a military coup. It was later determined that leaders of the coup had been paid by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. In 2004, Aristide was deposed again through a multi-year effort by Washington, who took him out of the country and into forced exile for seven years.""

In a recent post for our ""Haiti: Relief and Reconstruction Watch"" blog, Jake Johnston explains why various electoral observers, presidential candidates and others have good reason to be concerned that the results could be tainted by fraud: ""On Monday, Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) announced that the preliminary results of the October 25 presidential and legislative elections, expected to be announced today, would be delayed until Thursday. The delay has been attributed to the formation of a committee by the CEP to investigate allegations of fraud coming from political parties and local observer groups. The committee consists of five members of the electoral council. Of the 162 complaints received, the committee says 43 are being followed up on, though few are placing their trust in the process. 

""The elections were praised after there were only a few sporadic outbursts of violence, leading many in the international community to quickly conclude that there were few problems. Just as it had done in August, the Organization of American States (OAS) proclaimed the day after the vote that any problems 'did not affect the overall course of the election.' After violence shut down nearly one out of every six voting centers in the August legislative elections, this was apparently the new standard by which to judge the elections.

""At least a half-dozen leading presidential candidates have come out before results are even announced to denounce widespread fraud in favor of the government's candidate, Jovenèl Moïse.

Jake writes: ""More than 12 people were reported killed over the weekend in clashes between rival gangs in Haiti's capital, a spate of violence blamed on groups battling for control over voting centers ahead of the country's election on Sunday.

""On Monday, Radio Metropole reported multiple fatalities in the impoverished Cité Soleil neighborhood of Port-au-Prince. Haitian police have yet to release a statement about the killings. Local human rights groups are collecting information, but representatives said it was still too early to confirm the number of dead or the exact circumstances of the murders.

""The mayor of Cité Soleil, Esau Beauchard, who was appointed by President Michel Martelly, said that the brother of former parliamentarian Almetis Junior Saint-Fleur was among those killed in an armed confrontation with a specialized unit of the Haitian National Police. Saint-Fleur, who is running for deputy in Cité Soleil under the Organization of People in Struggle (OPL) party, blamed the mayor and a rival deputy candidate for the bloodshed.

""An anonymous source told Haiti's Radio Kiskeya that notorious gang leader Gabriel Jean Pierre was involved in the killings. Arrested in September 2014, Jean-Pierre was released in late December. According to Pierre Esperance of the National Human Rights Defense Network, groups close to the government distributed weapons to Jean-Pierre in January 2015.

'It was right at that moment that the situation deteriorated in Cité Soleil…Gabriel is protected by the national police, who are in cahoots with him and his armed gang,' Esperance told Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste in February.""

First, like the TPP, NAFTA was never mostly about trade, and even less about free trade. In 1994, the U.S. already had low tariff barriers to Mexican goods. The agreement was much more about creating and expanding new rights and privileges for investors, mostly multinational corporations. For example, the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provision of NAFTA allowed corporations to sue governments directly for laws or judicial decisions that infringed upon their profits. This became a threat to environmental, food safety, public health and other regulation. The main concern is that the sovereign laws and judicial systems of the signatories of treaties such as NAFTA could be subordinated to a tribunal established by the agreement, without the guarantees and extent of due process of, e.g. the U.S. legal system, and by judges who were generally more sympathetic to corporations than to the public interest.  

""The ISDS is one of the most important provisions of the TPP that has evoked opposition from environmental and other public interest groups. Proponents of the treaty argue that we have now have ISDS in dozens of international agreements, and there have been only 13 judgments against the U.S. But as economist Jeffrey Sachs has pointed out, corporations are just getting started with using this advantage: 'In 1995, only a handful of ISDS cases had been filed; as of the end of 2014, there had been more than 600 known claims (because most arbitration can be conducted in secrecy, there may have been many more claims).'

""Since NAFTA, economists have also learned that the gains from the parts of these agreements that have to do with trade are extremely small.""

When a 21st century coup d'état ousts the only president they ever believed in, these farmers take over the plantations…with no plans to ever give them back.

Shot over four years, ""Resistencia: The Fight for The Aguan Valley"" follows three members of Honduras' landless farmers' movement as they take control of the plantations of the most powerful man in Honduras. All in the midst of the first coup d'état in Central America in three decades. It is without doubt one of the most daring acts witnessed in recent Latin American history.

STRAIGHT FROM THE FESTIVALS TO DC

The film has already received standing ovations at the Quebec Film Festival (RVCQ) in Montréal, the International Political Cinema Festival (FICIP) in Buenos Aires, alongside presentations in Austria, US, UK, and of course Honduras. It has  been seen on millions of televisions throughout Latin America, Spain and the United States in a primetime broadcast on teleSUR (the world's largest Spanish-language public broadcaster).

This DC premier screening of the english version will include a discussion with filmmaker Jesse Freeston and other panelists, moderated by IPS Associate Fellow Manuel Pérez-Rocha.

It was an acknowledgment that more than half a century of trying to topple the Cuban government, through invasion, assassination attempts, economic embargo, and other — mostly illegal — efforts had failed. It was also a concession to the majority of the hemisphere, which had informed Washington in 2012 that there would not be another Summit of the Americas without Cuba.

""It was not necessarily a change in U.S. objectives, as a number of statements from the U.S. government indicate that the goal of normalizing relations and expanding commerce with Cuba is still ""regime change"" by other means. But it is nonetheless a major step forward, after the U.S. had been isolated in the entire world on this issue for decades, with repeated votes against the embargo at the U.N. general assembly — such as last year's tally of 188-2 (only Israel voted with the U.S.).

""Last week, the Cuban government reiterated its position that in order for relations to be normalized, the U.S. must not only end the embargo but pay compensation for the damage that it has caused to Cuba and its people over the past 54 years. Cuban President Raúl Castro also reminded Washington that the Guantanamo prison and military base must be closed and the land returned to Cuba.

""These are entirely reasonable requests from Cuba. The U.S. forced Cuba to accede to the military base in 1903, as well as grant permission to the United States to intervene in its internal affairs, as a condition of its ""independence."" Furthermore, even if one ignores the how the lease originated, it was granted for a naval and coaling station – not a prison.

Between 2011 and 2014, economic growth averaged only 2.1 percent annually, compared with 4.4 percent in the 2004-2010 period.

""The recent downturn can be squarely blamed on economic policies implemented by Rousseff's first administration (2010-14). This policy change sought to reduce the state's role of directly promoting the expansion of aggregate demand through fiscal stimulus and promoting supply side structural change through public investment, a strategy that had been done quite successfully until 2010. Meanwhile, inclusionary social policies concerned with decreasing inequality remained in place.

""President Rousseff and her party (including former President Luis Lula da Silva) decided — in an attempt to reduce the rising criticism from firms, banks, part of the Congress, and the media — that the government was intervening ""too much"" in the economy. They shifted the government's economic role to providing incentives (generous, unconditional tax cuts to firms) for private investment so as that the business sector would lead (instead of follow) economic growth.

""This policy failed completely. This was compounded when unusually dry weather and mismanagement of overall energy policy by Eletrobras, the large state-owned electricity company, pushed the country close to a serious energy supply crisis and power shortage in 2014, even though demand was low because growth had dropped.

""Instead of reverting to the previous successful policies of 2005-10, and improving long-term planning (through better technological and infrastructure policies), the second Rousseff administration fully committed itself to the policies proposed by the neoliberal opposition.""

Somos los autores de dos capítulos sobre América latina en el nuevo libro The Wikileaks Files, y de un artículo sobre estos capítulos en la página de la revista Jacobin (https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/).  

A contrario de lo que declaran algunos medios, no hemos afirmado que los cables de la embajada de EE.UU. en La Paz revelan que los EE.UU ""habrían financiado"" un plan ""para asesinar"" a Presidente Morales, ni que los EE.UU estuvieran directamente involucrados en un plan de golpe de Estado en contra del gobierno Boliviano. Lo que hemos afirmado es que los documentos de la embajada estadounidense en La Paz, que habían sido citados primero por WikiLeaks, muestran que la embajada estadounidense estaba en contacto regular con líderes de la oposición Boliviana en agosto y septiembre de 2008, durante la campaña de violencia y destrucción que se llevó a cabo en los departamentos de la Media Luna con el fin de separarse del resto de Bolivia o de derrotar al gobierno de Evo Morales. Además, estos documentos revelan que la embajada estadounidense en La Paz tenía un plan de contingencia en caso de que ocurriría un golpe del estado, o incluso el asesinato del Presidente Morales. Este plan está relacionado con supuestos peligros que correrían funcionarios y ciudadanos estadounidenses en Santa Cruz especialmente, donde se vieron enfrentamientos violentos entre grupos opositores, como la Unión Juvenil Cruceñista, y partidarios del gobierno. Por ejemplo, este cable nota que: ""La misión [diplomática] ya envió un mensaje (…) alertando los ciudadanos estadounidenses sobre posible violencia el 24 de septiembre y enviará otro mensaje (…) alertando los ciudadanos estadounidenses acerca del hecho que American Airlines haya suspendido vuelos a Bolivia hasta el 29 de septiembre.  Todos los estadounidenses oficiales han sido evacuados de Santa Cruz.""

Sin embargo, las revelaciones que se encuentran en los cables de la embajada estadounidense en La Paz, publicados por WikiLeaks, son muy importantes, y dan a pensar que el gobierno de EE.UU. mantenía contactos más estrechos y regulares con líderes opositores que lo que se sabía en 2008. Además, los documentos señalan la existencia de vínculos estrechos entre líderes de la oposición y grupos violentos.  Se ve que el gobierno de EE.UU veía la posibilidad de un golpe de estado, o de la muerte del Presidente Morales, como posibilidades tan reales que consideraba necesario instar a los ciudadanos estadounidenses a no viajar para Bolivia, y evacuar funcionarios estadounidenses de Santa Cruz. Sin embargo, al parecer el gobierno de EE.UU nunca se comunicó con el gobierno boliviano para informarles a cerca de la actividades y declaraciones de sus contactos en la oposición sobre planes violentos y destrucción de propiedad que se fomentaban ""para forzar al Gobierno … a tomar en serio cualquier diálogo"".

También, estos documentos revelan que el gobierno de EE.UU dio un apoyo financiero a entes opositoras, incluyendo los departamentos de la Media Luna que querían separarse de Bolivia. Junto con los demás cables ya mencionados, estas revelaciones generan muchas preguntas importantes y serias sobre las relaciones entre el gobierno estadounidense y la oposición boliviana en 2008 y después. Sin embargo, los cables no presentan evidencia de que los EE.UU. estaba financiando un golpe, ni un complot para asesinar a Morales, como ha sido afirmado por algunos periódicos en días recientes.

Esperamos que personas que tienen interés en las revelaciones por WikiLeaks lean nuestro artículo, y que lean el libro The Wikileaks Files también.

""Failed: What the 'Experts' Got Wrong About the Global Economy""
by Mark Weisbrot

With a preface by Ha-Joon Chang

""Comprehensive, long overdue and a resounding success""
- Larry Elliott, Economics Editor, The Guardian

""For those who wish to understand the global economy of the past generation, the shocking failures and impressive successes, this is the book to read…a timely, authoritative, and very valuable study.""
- Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor and Professor of Linguistics (Emeritus), MIT

""Mark Weisbrot demolishes the illusions of Europe and the IMF…""
- James Galbraith, Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. Chair in Government/Business Relations at University of Texas-Austin

FAILED analyzes why important economic developments of recent years have been widely misunderstood, and in some cases almost completely ignored. First, in the Eurozone, Mark Weisbrot argues that the European authorities' political agenda played a very important role in prolonging the Eurozone's financial crisis and pushing it into years of recession and mass unemployment. 

The second central theme of FAILED is that there are always practical alternatives to prolonged economic failure. Drawing on the history of other financial crises, recessions, and recoveries, Weisbrot also argues that regardless of initial conditions, there have been and remain economically feasible choices for governments of the Eurozone to greatly reduce unemployment-including the hardest hit, crisis-ridden country of Greece.

The long-term economic failure of developing countries, its social consequences, as well as the subsequent recovery in the first decade of the 21st century, constitute the third part of the book's narrative. We see why the International Monetary Fund has lost influence in middle income countries. http://ow.ly/SOqlu","Failed: What the ""Experts"" Got Wrong About the Global Economy",link,http://ow.ly/SOqlu,2015-09-30 09:05:42,47,1,23,47,0,0,0,0,0

The Jacobin article begins: ""Earlier this summer, the world watched Greece try to resist a disastrous neoliberal diktat and get a painful thrashing in the process.

""When Greece's left government decided to hold a national referendum on the troika-imposed austerity program, the European Central Bank retaliated by restricting liquidity for Greek banks. This triggered a prolonged bank closure and plunged Greece further into recession.

""Though Greek voters ended up massively rejecting austerity, Germany and the European creditor cartel were able to subvert democracy and get exactly what they wanted: complete submission to their neoliberal agenda.

""In the last decade and a half, a similar fight against neoliberalism has been waged across the breadth of an entire continent, and mostly outside of the public eye. Although Washington initially sought to quash all dissent, often employing even fiercer tactics than those used against Greece, Latin America's resistance to the neoliberal agenda has in large part been successful. It's an epic tale that's gradually coming to light thanks to continued exploration of the massive trove of US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks.

""What are we to make of Syriza's victory in the Greek election on Sunday? As in January, Syriza's Alexis Tsipras will be able to form a parliamentary majority in coalition with the right-wing populist Independent Greeks party. On the other hand, they are now committed to implementing a harsh, deeply unpopular austerity program that even its advocates among the European authorities acknowledge will keep the Greek economy in depression through the end of this year and next.

""Does this mean that the battle for Greece's future is over and that those who claimed that there was no alternative to prolonged depression, mass unemployment and a more unequal and frankly, uglier society have won?

""There is no question that the European authorities — the European Central Bank, the European Commission and Eurogroup of finance ministers (led by Germany) — and the International Monetary Fund have for now succeeded in imposing their will on Greece. On July 5, the vast majority of Greeks voted to reject their economic plan, including further austerity. But the ECB did something that perhaps no central bank had ever done: It forced a shutdown of the Greek banking system. This caused economic havoc that pushed the economy back into recession and threated to prolong and deepen the depression that Greeks had already suffered for six years. This act of financial terrorism worked: Syriza made a U-turn after the referendum, accepting the European officials' plan, and told the Greek people that there was no choice.""

12350395521_10153659066620522,"Washington, D.C.- The Greek election will not resolve the most important problems facing the country, CEPR co-Director Mark Weisbrot said today. With almost a third of the votes counted, it appeared that Syriza was the clear winner with a projected total of 35.5 percent of votes, even though the party's leader, Alexis Tsipras, had reversed course earlier this year and agreed to implement austerity measures in return for a 86 billion euro ($97 billion) bailout package. Center-right New Democracy was second with about 28 percent, and New Democracy leader Vangelis Meimarakis quickly conceded to Syriza and Tsipras.

""Financial terrorism by the European authorities has succeeded, for now,"" Weisbrot said. ""With a gun to their head, most voters were convinced that there was no choice but to accept continuing depression, for this year and 2016. But there are in fact better choices than the major parties were offering, and there will likely be a number of battles ahead against the implementation of further austerity.""

The IMF has projected that Greek GDP will shrink by a further 2.5 percent this year, and European officials have forecast recession for 2016 as well. Greece has lost more than a quarter of its output since 2008, and unemployment remains at 24.6 percent.

Weisbrot noted that there was a record low turnout, so Syriza's percent of eligible voters was probably around 20 percent. Still, he said, it was impressive that the party was able to remain in power after the European authorities had taken such extreme measures, including direct sabotage of the economy, in order to discredit them and drive them from power. These included the ECB's denial of credit necessary to the financial system, forcing a shutdown of the banking system that guaranteed continued depression.

Their price tag was $18 trillion over the next decade. This is presumably supposed to scare people because, let's face it $18 trillion is a really big number.

""Much of the fright factor disappears when we realize that $15 trillion of this $18 trillion comes from the WSJ's estimate of the cost of Sanders' universal Medicare program. That is a considerable chunk of change, but as Kevin Drum and others have pointed out this will not be new money out of people's pockets. For the most part this is money that employers are now paying for their workers' health care insurance. Instead, under a universal Medicare system the government would get this money in tax revenue. Since Canada and the other wealthy countries with universal Medicare-type systems all have much lower per capita health care costs than the United States (the average is less than half the cost), in all probability we would be paying less for our health care under the Sanders' system than we do now.

""This still leaves $3 trillion for us to get frightened over, and this still looks like a really big number. As a point of reference, GDP over the next decade is projected at roughly $240 trillion. This makes the cost of the rest of Sanders' plans equal to less than 1.3 percent of GDP. 

""Should we worry about that? The increase in annual military spending from 2000 to the peaks of Iraq/Afghanistan wars was roughly 1.8 percent of GDP.

After all, if Lehman was not too big to fail, who was?

""At that point, policy could have gone two directions. One direction would have been to take advantage of this moment and let the market work its magic. The bloated financial structure that had developed over the last three decades was collapsing from its own excesses. The industry would have paid the price for the issuing and packaging of hundreds of billions of dollars of fraudulent loans, as they finally ran out of suckers to buy the junk.

The paper, ""Honduras: IMF Austerity, Macroeconomic Policy, and Foreign Investment,"" by CEPR Research Assistant Stephan Lefebvre, notes that the agreement, which provides Honduras with $189 million in financing over three years, includes many austerity measures, despite the weak labor market and growing poverty, and provides almost no protections for the most vulnerable sectors of society. As a condition of the deal, Honduran authorities agreed to implement fiscal consolidation amounting to 6.5 percent of GDP over four years, in addition to so-called ""structural reforms"" including privatizations, pension reforms and public sector layoffs.

""Thousands of people fled Honduras for the U.S. last year due to widespread crime, broken institutions, and a deteriorating economy,"" CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot noted. ""Yet the IMF's prescriptions are likely to weaken the economy further and worsen Honduras' problems.

""Honduran labor markets have yet to return to their pre-global-recession level and both poverty and inequality remain too high, with little sign of improvement,"" Weisbrot said. ""Following a program of austerity—which the IMF itself seems to recognize will be highly unpopular—is likely to cause further deterioration.""

The paper notes:

•    The broadest measure of unemployment and underemployment increased from 35.5 percent of the labor force in 2008 to 56.4 percent in 2013. It is highly probable that pursuing austerity measures in this context will make the situation worse.

As I noted in previous columns, this effort included an unprecedented meeting between President Barack Obama and President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela at the April Summit of the Americas, the dispatch of a high-level diplomat (Thomas Shannon) to meet with Venezuelan officials and abstention from hostile rhetoric against the government of Venezuela for perhaps the longest period in 14 years. These were positive signs and were undoubtedly related to Washington's beginning of normalizing relations with Cuba, which culminated in the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington on July 20.

""More recently, however, there are disturbing signs that the White House is not as serious about normalizing relations with Venezuela as it is with Cuba.

""One of those signs has been recent statements from Secretary of State John Kerry and the State Department calling for ""credible and timely electoral observation"" for Venezuela's December elections to the National Assembly. Though the State Department has not explained what is meant by 'credible and timely,' the statements closely coincide with a major lobbying effort on the part of the Venezuelan opposition to have the Organization of American States (OAS) send an observation mission. As I noted previously, there were signals in June from the more hard-line right in Washington foreign policy circles that this would be part of an attempt to delegitimize the elections.

""The original rationale for higher interest rates was the need to stop inflation. We have had people harping on the risk of hyper-inflation since 2009. Inflation has remained stubbornly low these last six years, consistently remaining under the Fed's 2.0 percent target. If anything, the recent trend has been downward as a result of the collapse of the price of oil and other commodities.

""If the threat of inflation isn't adequate for selling an interest-rate hike, the next move was the need to have higher rates to attack bubbles. The big problem with this story is that it is not clear that we have any bubbles, nor is it obvious that hiking interest rates is the best way to address them if we did.

""House prices are high compared to their historic trend, but certainly well below their bubble peak on an inflation-adjusted basis. Cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles are arguably seeing housing bubbles, but it would be rather bizarre to slow the nation's economy in order to bring down house prices in a few cities where the housing market has gone a bit frothy.

""The stock market is also somewhat high, but considerably lower after China fears knocked 10 percent off the values of the major indexes. Here too we can point to some tech companies such as Uber whose stock seems clearly over-valued, but do we want the whole country to suffer to provide a lesson to some Silicon Valley venture capitalists and their followers?

Weisbrot said the economic impact of leaving the euro (a so-called ""Grexit"") would be less severe than the continuing depression that will result from a new bailout arrangement Tsipras' government has negotiated with the European authorities.

""European Union officials have already said that, under the new agreement, the Greek economy will remain in depression for this year and next,"" Weisbrot said. ""This is not a bailout for the Greek people – this is the Greek people being thrown overboard.""

Weisbrot noted that even this prognosis, which forecasts a return to growth in 2017, is likely to be over-optimistic. Almost every forecast from the IMF, for example, since 2010 has been wrong, and the outcome has been significantly worse.

""Many people accept this continued punishment because they think the alternative would be worse,"" Weisbrot said. ""But it is unlikely that Greece would remain in depression for longer than what is forecast for the current program, if the country were to issue its own currency. And it could avoid some of the worst 'reforms' that the European authorities are demanding.""

Tsipras announced today that he will step down and call snap elections for September 20.

Poverty declined by 55 percent and extreme poverty by 65 percent from 2003 to 2012. Unemployment hit record lows, the real (inflation adjusted) minimum wage doubled, and the gains from growth were more equally distributed than in previous decades.

""A large majority of Brazilians are still vastly better off today than they were before the PT came to power.

There are however more serious ways to think about addressing global inequality.

""One of the main reasons that workers in the United States get much higher wages than workers in the developing world is that they have more capital to work with. They also are much better educated on average. The same policy can help to address both gaps. Specifically, we can make our ""intellectual property"" freely available to the rest of the world at the cost of transferring it, which will generally be close to zero.

The paper shows that the sharp slowdown that Brazil has experienced since 2011 is overwhelmingly the result of a significant decline in domestic demand that resulted from policy choices made by the government. It concludes that this decision to slow the economy was not necessary as there was no external constraint, such as a balance-of-payments problem, that warranted it.

""There have been enormous economic and social gains since the Workers' Party took office in 2003, in terms of reducing poverty (by 55 percent) and extreme poverty (by 65 percent), increasing employment, income growth, and some reduction in inequality,"" CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot said.

The authors argue that the slowdown overwhelmingly results from a sharp decline in domestic demand led by government policy, rather than from a fall in exports or from any change in external financial conditions.

Even if they miss these targets, which is likely, just trying to do what they have committed to will keep the economy from recovering.  

""The Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research in Athens has projected that the Greek economy will not recover in 2016.

Clearly it is not about the money – the Financial Times estimated that the primary surpluses will contribute about 4.5 billion euros out of what is now an 86 billion euro package. Punishment is probably part of the motivation for these hateful conditions, as well as a fear on the part of the tormentors that ""leniency"" could encourage people in other vulnerable eurozone economies to vote for left parties or demand an earlier exit from mass unemployment.

The biggest factors were a turnaround in the trade balance and an uptick in the rate of consumption growth.

In the first quarter, exports fell at a 6.3 percent annual rate.

The improvement in the trade balance contributed 0.13 percentage points to growth after subtracting 1.92 percentage points in the first quarter.

Consumption grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter, up from a weather-depressed 1.1 percent rate in the first quarter. The biggest change was in durable goods. People who put off buying cars in the harsh winter weather instead bought in the second quarter, leading to a 7.3 percent rate of increase in durable good sales compared to a 2.0 percent rate in the first quarter. Consumption contributed 1.99 percentage points to growth in the second quarter compared to 1.19 percentage points in the first quarter.

The personal saving rate was 4.8 percent for the quarter, the same as the average of 2014. This should end speculation about why people are not spending their dividend from lower gas prices, since the data indicate they are. Consumption is at near-record highs as a share of GDP, which makes the frequent fretting over cautious consumers seem more than a bit peculiar.

Their argument was simple: The reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers will increase efficiency and economic growth. This is the standard argument for free trade.

""Given this general view within the economics profession why TPP is good policy, it is striking that so few economists have been outspoken in opposition to the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a government agency that aids U.S. exports through loan and insurance guarantees. On June 30, Congress did not reauthorize the bank, which meant that it could not extend new credit, though it could still manage its existing portfolio of loans. Republican Senators led a vote to reauthorize the bank in the Senate, and now the issue has moved to the House. The whole point of the Ex-Im Bank, of course, is to have the government subsidize selected companies by giving them access to credit at below-market interest rates. This is totally at odds with free trade. It means the government is allocating credit rather than markets. It would be expected to lead to the same type of economic distortions as tariffs and quotas.

""The arguments put forward in support of the Ex-Im Bank should have been especially painful to economists, since they are exactly the same arguments made in support of protectionist trade measures. For example, proponents of the Ex-Im Bank routinely talk about the number of jobs supported by the bank's loans, implying that all of these jobs would somehow disappear without subsidized loans from the Ex-Im Bank.""

Deadlines came and went, and threats of a forced Grexit were mainly bluff, despite the fact that the most powerful leader of the eurogroup of finance ministers, Germany's Wolfgang Schäuble, seemed to favor it. Under these circumstances, regime change looked relatively easy: The European Central Bank (ECB), by restricting credit, together with the standoff and rumors of Grexit, had already pushed the Greek economy back into recession. It seemed only a matter of time before Greece's ongoing economic failure, combined with anti-Syriza media coverage, would undermine the current government and pave the way for a new one.

""In his first interview since his July 6 resignation from the post of Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis describes 'The complete lack of any democratic scruples, on behalf of the supposed defenders of Europe's democracy,' i.e. his eurozone negotiating partners. They continuously 'delayed and then came up with the kind of proposal you present to another side when you don't want an agreement.'

""On June 26, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called their bluff by announcing the referendum, which on July 5 produced a landslide 'no' vote against further austerity and regressive 'reforms.'

The money was allocated shortly after Washington helped overturn the election results to thrust Martelly into power.

The elections were a fraudulent mess, they told the gathered press, and the only way out was to cancel the poll and start over. Chaos soon engulfed Port-au-Prince and other cities, as thousands of young Haitians, many clad in the pink synonymous with Michel 'Sweet Micky' Martelly, took to the streets to simultaneously denounce electoral fraud and herald the victory of their candidate, many days before any official results would be announced.

""In the midst of the mayhem, key international actors mobilized. At an emergency meeting at the home of the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission, Edmond Mulet, leading diplomats pushed then-President René Préval to accept their offer of a plane to take him out of the country and avoid further confrontation. Mulet also approached the front-runners, including Martelly, telling them they had secured a spot in the second round and to cease calls for the election's cancellation. Days later, when the electoral council announced preliminary results that did not have Martelly advancing to the runoff, the streets were once again taken over by largely pro-Martelly protesters.

""Negotiations in the WTO are heating up – and they are going badly. In November last year, WTO members agreed to come up with a 'Work Program' for resurrecting the Doha Round by July 31. As you may remember, it had been stalled for years, but since the new Director-General, Roberto Azevêdo of Brazil, took over in September of 2013, he has been shaking things up. The first WTO expansion agreement, on 'Trade Facilitation,' was concluded in December 2013, along with a promise to negotiate to reduce WTO constraints WTO on developing countries' ability to feed their poor. 

""It must be remembered that developing countries only agreed to launch a new round of negotiations in order to address problems with the previous round that resulted in the founding of the WTO in 1995. Since then, they have been advocating for a series of fixes to the existing agreements. Many of their proposals dovetail with calls from global civil society for a turnaround in the global trade agenda.

""However, after nearly 14 of negotiations, the United States has decided that India, China, Brazil, and other developing countries – in which the vast majority of the world's impoverished people live – can no longer be considered as developing countries. Even worse, they want to clear the deck of the development demands and get on with introducing even more radical liberalization agenda. Thus the U.S. – sometimes in conjunction with the European Union, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, but sometimes unilaterally – is insisting on jettisoning the previous agreements, 're-calibrating' the talks, and reducing the ambition of the deal.

""This has pushed Greece closer to a more serious financial crisis than the country has had in the past five years of austerity-induced depression. Why did the ECB decide to take this harsh, unnecessary and dangerous measure now?

""It seems clear that the move is in response to the Greek government's decision to hold a referendum on whether to accept the last offer from the European authorities outlining conditions for continuing official lending to Greece. The financial problems and inconveniences of this week, caused by the bank holiday, are the European authorities' way of saying, 'Vote as we'll tell you to, or we can make your lives even more miserable than we have been making them.'

""This offer included further cuts to Greek pensions, as well as regressive tax increases. As economist Paul Krugman has noted, these are conditions that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras can't accept. 'The purpose must therefore be to drive him from office,' Mr. Krugman concluded.

""There is considerable evidence that this has been the European authorities' strategy since the anti-austerity Syriza party was elected in January. Just 10 days after the election, the ECB cut off its main line of credit to Greek banks, even though there was no obvious reason to do so. Shortly thereafter, the ECB put a limit on how much Greek banks could lend to the government – a limit that the previous government did not have.

The headline warns readers, 'imagine Argentina, but much worse.' The article includes several assertions that are misleading or false.

'First, it is difficult to describe the default in Argentina as a disaster. The economy had been plummeting prior to the default, which occurred at the end of the year in 2001. The country's GDP had actually fallen more before the default than it did after the default. (This is not entirely clear on the graph, since the data is annual. At the point where the default took place in December of 2001, Argentina's GDP was already well below the year-round average.) While the economy did fall more sharply after the default, it soon rebounded and by the end of 2003 it had regained all the ground lost following the default.

'Argentina's economy continued to grow rapidly for several more years, rising above pre-recession levels in 2004. Given the fuller picture, it is difficult to see the default as an especially disastrous event even if it did lead to several months of uncertainty for the people of Argentina. In this respect, it is worth noting that Paul Volcker is widely praised in policy circles for bringing down the inflation rate. To accomplish this goal he induced a recession that pushed the unemployment rate to almost 11 percent. So the idea that short-term pain might be a price worth paying for a longer term benefit is widely accepted in policy circles.

""At one point the piece refers to the views of Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's finance minister, on the difficulties of leaving the euro. It relies on what it describes as a 'recent blogpost.'

While it may not be immediately apparent, the views of elite commentators on these two events tell us a great deal about their views on economic policy.

""The defeat of the original fast-track proposal, due to a revolt by House Democrats, infuriated the likes of George Will, David Brooks and members of The Washington Post editorial board, who all expressed deep dismay that Congress may block the TPP. They have raised various issues, but one recurring theme is that the TPP will promote economic growth and that the opponents are apparently willing to sacrifice this growth if they block the deal.

""The claim the TPP will promote growth is dubious. After all, a study by the United States Department of Agriculture found the impact on growth would be a rounding error in GDP. Furthermore, none of the studies that have made growth projections incorporate any negative impact on growth due to higher drug costs or other price increases associated with the TPP's stronger and longer patent protections.

The explicit purpose is to make patent protection stronger and longer. While these provisions are likely to lead to higher drug prices in the United States, they will have their greatest impact in the developing world.

""In most developing countries, drugs are far cheaper than in the United States. This is especially the case in India. The country has a world-class generic industry that produces high quality drugs that typically sell for a small fraction of the price in the United States. For example, the generic version of the Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi can be purchased in India for less than $1,000 a treatment. The patent protected version sells in the United States for $84,000.

""The U.S. drug industry desperately wants to eliminate this sort of price gap, which can exceed a ratio of one hundred to one. While India is not in the TPP, the goal of TPP proponents is to expand the pact over time so that India would eventually be included and therefore be subject to its strong patent rules.

""This should have everyone very worried. The patent system is a horribly outmoded method of financing research that dates from the 15th century. The idea is that the government provides an incentive for innovation by giving the inventor a patent monopoly over use of the innovation for a period of time.

Surprise move Shows that Troika Can't Dictate the Terms of an Agreement

For Immediate Release: June 5, 2015
Contact: Dan Beeton, 202-239-1460

Washington, D.C.- The Greek government's decision to defer payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) represents an important development for Greece's negotiations with the European authorities and its efforts to emerge from the economic downturn that has persisted since the Global Recession of 2008-2009, CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot said today.

""This shows that the troika, and the ECB especially, is not holding all the cards, as many had thought,"" Weisbrot said. ""The Syriza-led government in Athens meanwhile is demonstrating that 'elections have consequences,' and that the European authorities—who are mainly responsible for more than six years of depression in Greece—will also have to compromise.""

Greece will bundle its debt payments into a single payment due at the end of June, according to IMF spokespersons. In so doing, Greece is the first country to defer a payment to the IMF, in this manner, since the 1980s.",,status,,2015-06-05 09:58:01,15,1,8,15,0,0,0,0,0

It is the U.S. that has been a state sponsor of terrorism directed at Cuba. From the launching of the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 to the numerous U.S.-organized assassination attempts against Fidel Castro to the blowing up of a jetliner and other terrorist attacks from Cuban exiles operating out of the United States, U.S. terrorism against Cuba has spanned more than four decades.

""The latest move removes one obstacle from the normalization of relations with Cuba, but there are many more ahead, including the 53-year-old U.S. embargo, which has been condemned by nearly the entire world for decades, and the much-hated U.S. military base and prison at Guantánamo, which the Cubans have indicated is a deal breaker if it is not closed down. Another irony: The U.S. government lectures Cuba about human rights while it illegally imprisons and tortures people on the island.

""But another issue Cuba has raised with Washington could have even more important implications for the region. It is now apparent, as I first suggested a month ago, that the Cubans made it clear to President Barack Obama that normalization of relations would be limited if Washington was unwilling to normalize relations with Venezuela. This is important because U.S. hostility toward Venezuela, especially Washington's support for regime change there, has poisoned relations with Latin America even more than the embargo against Cuba.

""members of the New Democrat Coalition [a group of centrist Democrats in Congress] heard from frustrated tech executives who pleaded with them to help boost global growth and demanded to know why the president's party was not lining up behind his trade push.""

""In fact the tech executives were not pleading with them to help 'boost global growth,' or if they were they were not being honest. There are no models that show the TPP having more than a trivial impact on global growth. In fact, the United States Department of Agriculture projected that the impact on growth in the United States would be too small to measure.

""If the tech executives were pleading with the New Democratic Coalition to 'boost global growth' it was an argument of the form, 'give me money, it will be good for the economy.' The reality is that they of course want a deal that they helped craft to make themselves richer.

""Contrary to the assertions in this article, the TPP is absolutely not about expanding trade. In fact, it increases protectionism in important areas in the form of stronger and longer patent and copyright protections. No models have sought to estimate the costs to the economy of these government granted monopolies. It is likely these costs are substantial since they can raise the price of the protected items by a hundredfold or more.

Suppose we had a large enough influx of foreign doctors to push their average pay down to European levels. Instead of getting around $250,000 a year, they would earn about $125,000. This would save the public close to $100 billion a year in doctors' fees, but it would mean lower incomes for doctors.

However, only two months later, as Secretary of Labor Alfonso Navarrete boasted that the program was rescuing people working practically in slave conditions, thousands of farmworkers in the San Quintín Valley in the Northeastern state of Baja California went on strike, demanding higher wages and better working conditions from the government and multinational corporations.

For those who don't remember, the Flash Crash was when the stock market lost almost 9 percent of its value from its opening level, with most of this decline occurring in a five-minute period.

""The market quickly recovered most of this loss. As long as you didn't sell stock in the 30 minute crash interval, you weren't affected by this plunge. But the crash did reveal the extraordinary instability in the stock market due to short-term trading.

""The issue of short-term trading is the key here. There was no event in the world that triggered the plunge. There was no outbreak of war, major terrorist incident, or natural disaster that sent stock prices plummeting. There wasn't even a bad profit report from a major company. The crash was based simply on program trading that fed back on itself, turning a downward blip into a major plunge.

""Much of this trading came from high-frequency trading, program trading that profits by jumping ahead of major movements in the market. This has led to an unfortunate focus on high-frequency trading, an ill-defined concept, as opposed to the more general issue that we have seen an explosion of short-term trading in recent decades.

""The average holding period for a share of stock is now less than five months, with short-term traders often flipping over the same shares several times in a day.

In the course of reading the book they are likely to conclude that he is not especially fond of unions or workers in general. He also doesn't like Social Security and Medicare. He even manages to get in a drive-by directed at Senator Elizabeth Warren.

""But the main villain of the book is clearly public sector unions. DiSalvo paints a dark conspiracy where public sector unions push for ever higher pay and benefits, work rules that allow for endless loafing on the job, and disciplinary policies that prevent even the most incompetent from being fired. High costs and low productivity strain public budgets, but the political power of public sector unions prevents effective steps to counter their abuses. Since the unions are such large donors to political campaigns, politicians can't stand up to them. It's a moving story; the data just don't quite fit the picture.

""Before getting into the details, I will follow DiSalvo's example and give some personal biography. My mother worked for 30 years in the Illinois Department of Public Aid.

CEPR Senior Economist Eileen Appelbaum writes at The Hill: ""The comment period is now open for new rules proposed by the Obama administration that require financial professionals to put workers' interests ahead of their own when they make recommendations for retirement savings. Modernizing the rules to take account of the growth of worker-directed retirement savings plans such as 401(k) plans and IRAs is long overdue.

""Loopholes in the current regulations let plan advisers and brokers consider what they will earn in higher fees and commissions when providing financial advice to workers about how to invest their retirement savings. This is especially true when workers roll over funds from a 401(k) or similar account to an IRA—making workers vulnerable to getting bad advice just at the point at when they begin to manage their retirement savings themselves. The Labor Department, which oversees these types of retirement savings accounts, is concerned that workers may not end up in the most advantageous investments and may pay excessive fees that cut into their savings, a double whammy that the White House estimates costs employees $17 billion annually.

The episode aired at 11 PM EST 4/24/15.

In a sneak peek, Gandhi goes to the site of a housing expo held in 2011. Organized by the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission led by Bill Clinton, the expo was meant to showcase model homes that could be built across the country.

""If we do this housing properly, it will lead to whole new industries being started in Haiti, creating thousands and thousands of new jobs and permanent housing,"" Clinton stated after the earthquake.

But, as Ganghi shows, the expo never had the intended impact. Instead, the homes were abandoned and left to decay. Now, years later, the model houses have been occupied by residents, creating a new community in the rubble of the international community's broken promises.

Gandhi speaks with Jake Johnston, who explains how the U.S.' premier aid agency, USAID, had an ambitious plan to build some 15,000 houses.

12350395521_10153291187390522,"A new paper from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) examines recent IMF research on gains from multilateral trade liberalization, as under the WTO. This research shows that gains would be equal only to about 0.014 percent of consumption, or about 43 cents per person, per month, in the United States. The CEPR paper, ""The Gains from Trade in a New Model from the IMF: Still Very Small"" by David Rosnick, examines modeling by the IMF, which claims to find that WTO agreements to liberalize trade are worth more than previously thought. CEPR's paper shows that in fact the gains are relatively small.

""This paper again raises the question of whether the trade-offs that workers and consumers make in so many areas—including lowered safety and environmental standards, higher prices for pharmaceuticals and other patent-protected goods, and the undermining of local and national laws—are worth it considering how paltry the gains are,"" economist and lead author of the paper David Rosnick said. ""I don't think most Americans would choose to sacrifice so much in the name of lowered trade barriers just for 43 cents a month more in their pockets.""

The IMF model focuses on liberalization under the WTO, but if applied to the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, the results would be similarly small.

The IMF model examines the impacts each of unilateral, bilateral and multilateral trade liberalization. The modeling shows that countries can be worse off when they unilaterally lower protective trade barriers, as countries are often pressured to do in negotiations with the U.S. or other developed countries. Negotiations at the WTO and in other multilateral fora are also sometimes lopsided, such as WTO rules that prohibit various agricultural supports in developing countries even while large subsidies in developed countries are maintained.

""There are various narratives for what is happening to Greece as another deadline looms – the April 24 gathering of eurozone finance ministers in Riga, Latvia — and European officials show no sign of compromise. The most common tale is that this is a game of brinkmanship, with the Germans and their allies pushing for ""reforms"" that the Syriza government in Greece doesn't want to adopt. Most of the media seems more partial to the European officials than to Greece. But even among those who are more neutral or sympathetic to Greece, it is still a story about hardline European officials threatening to use their control over funding to the Greek government and banking system in order to bring Greece to its knees.

'But this narrative misses the elephant in the middle of the negotiating table: While the Greek government cannot do anything to replace its negotiating partners with people more to their liking, the European officials on the other side seem to believe they can do exactly that. And it is becoming increasingly clear that this is their current strategy.

""The idea is to do enough damage to the Greek economy during the negotiating process to undermine support for the current government, and ultimately replace it. The destabilization actually began before the Jan. 25 election, when officials from the then-ruling New Democracy Party announced that if Syriza won the election, Greece would leave the euro and people would not be able to get money from their bank accounts. In a nasty breach of protocol, they were supported by important European officials.

""As I have noted previously, the European Central Bank not only trained its guns on the new government but started firing on Feb. 4, just nine days after the election.

Through their control of trade policy, Federal Reserve Board policy, and other key levers of government, they have structured the market to weaken the bargaining power of ordinary workers and benefit the CEOs and Wall Street crew. As a result, the typical worker has seen almost none of the gains from economic growth over the last four decades.

The Obama administration is attempting to ""salvage the Summit of the Americas"" and avert another summit disaster by removing Cuba from its list of ""state sponsors of terrorism,"" CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot said today. But this latest sign of a softening of U.S. policy toward Cuba ""falls far short"" of the change in relations that had been a U.S. goal before the summit: the reopening of embassies. Obama's announcement is expected to come as early as tomorrow.

In recent days, the Obama administration has also attempted to walk back its March 9 designation that Venezuela represents an ""unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States"" in order to enact recent sanctions against Venezuelan officials. Deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes explained ""the United States does not believe that Venezuela poses some threat to our national security"" in an April 7 press briefing, and President Obama told the EFE news agency, ""We do not believe that Venezuela poses a threat to the United States, nor does the United States threaten the Venezuelan government.""

Mark writes for The Hill (http://ow.ly/Lpp08) about how the sanctions could result in a chilly reception for Obama in tropical Panama.

On April 9, he will be in Kingston, Jamaica for meetings with Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and the leaders of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), an organization made up of 15 Caribbean governments.  Then on April 10 and 11, he will be in Panama City where he'll participate in the seventh Summit of the Americas alongside the leaders of every independent government in the hemisphere including – for the first time – the Republic of Cuba.   

As we had predicted, the last Summit of the Americas that took place in Cartagena, Colombia in April of 2012 was a stormy affair for Obama, with many Latin American leaders objecting to the U.S.' refusal to allow Cuba's participation in the summit and criticizing the U.S. ""War on Drugs"" (not to mention that little scandal involving Secret Service agents and local prostitutes).  Following Obama's efforts to begin the normalization of relations with Cuba and the lifting of his veto on Raul Castro's participation in the Panama summit, many expect the U.S. president to receive a warmer welcome this time around.  But dark clouds have gathered again following the White House's executive order declaring Venezuela an ""extraordinary national security threat"" and slapping senior Venezuelan officials with sanctions. 

On April 7, two senior White House officials, Ricardo Zúñiga – National Security Council Senior Director for Western Hemisphere Affairs – and Ben Rhodes – Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications – provided the press with a briefing on Obama's trip to Kingston and Panama City.  As a service to our readers, CEPR has the pleasure of offering its own background briefing on some of the key issues that are sure to come up during Obama's trip, with a few choice contributions from the aforementioned White House briefing.

12350395521_10153255991915522,"CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot writes for Al Jazeera America today: The international media isn't paying much attention to President Obama's trip to Jamaica this week, but maybe they should. The country has become a terrible example of what can happen when creditors – led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – are able to impose harsh austerity on a trapped nation in an attempt to collect on an uncollectable debt. Since the U.S. Treasury Department decides what the IMF does in the Western Hemisphere, President Obama himself can claim responsibility for this crushing economic failure.

The Caribbean island nation, probably best known for dominating the sport of sprinting, has had declining living standards for the past 20 years. Per capita GDP has fallen by an average of 0.3 percent annually over the past two decades, making Jamaica the worst-performing economy in the hemisphere over this long haul. And this measures only average living standards – it is much worse at the bottom, where poverty has more than doubled since 2007, and unemployment is currently over 14 percent – higher than it stood during the world recession. (More detail can be found here.)

But the worst part, and where Washington bears the most responsibility, is the country's future prospects. It is currently under an IMF agreement that requires the government to run annual primary budget surpluses – revenue minus spending, excluding interest payments – of 7.5 percent. This is the worst such burden in the world. For comparison, Greece was projected to run a primary budget surplus of 3.0 percent this year and about 4.5 percent thereafter – and this is so unsustainable that it is causing a political crisis as well as a widespread belief that it can't possibly happen.

The kidnapping and disappearance of 43 students from a teacher-training college in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero has sparked renewed attention to the devastating effects of the U.S.-backed drug war in Mexico. More than six months have passed since the students' disappearance, and while dozens of police officials and local drug gang members have been arrested, the investigations are marred with allegations of coerced confessions, and investigators are accused of covering up the truth by suppressing information.

Currently, a ""caravan"" of family members of the victims is traveling around the U.S. to bring attention to the terrible consequences of the war against drugs in Mexico. Felipe de la Cruz Sandoval, spokesperson for the group of parents and a member of the Rural Teachers College of Ayotzinapa Guerrero, said the caravan aims ""to shed light on the foreign policy of the United States, specifically the Mérida Initiative and its connection with the socioeconomic conditions and violence in Mexico.""

The Mérida Initiative was negotiated behind closed doors between former presidents George W. Bush of the U.S. and Felipe Calderón of Mexico in March 2007, and was inaugurated in December 2008. The former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Antonio O. Garza, said months before it was approved that it was ""the most aggressive undertaking ever to combat Mexican drug cartels."" U.S. funding for judicial processes, forensic services, investigative capacity, and Mexico's judicial reforms doesn't seem to have had much impact so far: impunity remains rampant in Mexico, with 98.3 percent of crimes going unpunished.

Washington, D.C.- Ahead of President Obama's trip to Jamaica this week, a new paper from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) finds that Jamaica is running the most austere budget in the world, with a primary surplus of 7.5 percent, due to its IMF agreement, and that the government's interest payments on the debt and austerity have brought public investment to a low. The paper, ""Partners in Austerity: Jamaica, the United States and the International Monetary Fund"" by Jake Johnston, notes that Jamaica has a debt-to-GDP ratio of nearly 140 percent and its public interest burden is one of the very highest in the world, at over 8 percent of GDP last year. Coupled with the IMF-backed austerity, high interest payments have all but displaced needed capital spending, reducing government capital expenditure to a low of 1.6 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15.

The paper notes that after three consecutive quarters of economic growth, GDP fell by 1.4 percent in the third quarter of 2014, and the Jamaican economy is smaller today than it was in 2008. With anemic growth and continued austerity, social indicators have drastically worsened, with the poverty rate doubling since 2007. Unemployment, at 14.2 percent, remains higher today than during the height of the global recession.

""When President Obama travels to Jamaica this week, he will be going as someone partly responsible for the high unemployment and poverty that the country is suffering through,"" Jake Johnston said. ""This paper shows that through its leadership role in the IMF, the U.S. is imposing unnecessary pain on Jamaica through harsh austerity and a debt trap.""

Jamaica has suffered declining average living standards over the past 20 years, with GDP per capital actually falling by 0.3 percent annually over the past two decades. http://ow.ly/LivRy",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ceprDC/photos/a.183938150521.155174.12350395521/10153253198305522/?type=3,2015-04-07 10:00:07,20,2,20,20,0,0,0,0,0
12350395521_10153250902415522,"It is important that people recognize the debate over the Fed's interest rate policy is not an abstract academic exercise. The point of raising interest rates is to slow the economy and keep people from getting jobs. Higher rates have this effect by discouraging people from buying houses and cars, making mortgage refinancing less attractive, and reducing investment by companies and state and local governments.

The reason the Fed would want to keep people from having jobs is that it is worried that a strong labor market would lead to more rapid wage growth, which in turn would be passed on in higher prices. In other words, keeping people unemployed is a way to keep inflation under control.

The Federal Reserve Board, though, is actively debating policy that has takes away people's jobs and almost no one seems to care.

If robots were displacing workers on a large scale then we should be seeing very rapid productivity growth since it would mean that we are able to produce the same amount of output with many fewer workers. In fact, the data show the opposite.

On the other hand, the Fed is quite explicitly threatening workers' jobs with its rate hikes. Unfortunately, due to the state of economic reporting, there are probably few people in the country who recognize this fact.

""Unfortunately, there remains an international constraint towards achieving this: The global rules that actually govern agriculture – not just for trade but also domestic production – are set in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and they are appallingly unfair and antiquated.

""Fortunately, we now have the best chance in 20 years of changing the single most damaging aspect of the WTO: the rules that prohibit developing countries from investing in their own farmers. 

The Problem: Unfair, Antiquated Rules in the WTO

""The Agreement on Agriculture, which would become a foundational part of the WTO, was finalized in 1994. At that time, it was agreed that agricultural subsidies would be capped at their then-current level, and would be subject to gradual reduction. This applied most strongly to subsidies for food that would be exported, but it also applied to domestic subsidies, except in certain specified circumstances.

""The core unfairness of this arrangement resides in the fact that it was overwhelmingly rich countries that were subsidizing agricultural production at that time. Developing countries, by and large, were either too poor, or were subject to restrictions by the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank against agricultural subsidies.

""The argument was that countries would be better off producing cash crops like coffee or sugar cane for export, and then buying food in the global market for cheaper than they could produce at home.""

CEPR Research Associate Jake Johnston reported in February for VICE News:

""'CEEPCO's CEO is Harold Charles, a Haitian-American who was formerly one of the Haitian government's representatives to the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission (IHRC), run by Bill Clinton and meant to be in charge of the $10 billion in earthquake relief.

ECB President Mario Draghi denied this week that his institution is trying to blackmail the Greek government.

""But blackmail is actually an understatement of what the ECB and its European partners are doing to Greece. It has become increasingly clear that they are trying to harm the Greek economy in order to increase pressure on the new Greek government to agree to their demands.

""The first sign that this was the European authorities' strategy came on February 4 -- just 10 days after the Syriza government was elected -- when the European Central bank cut off the main source of financing for Greek banks. This move was clearly made in bad faith, since there was no bureaucratic or other reason to do this; it was more than three weeks before the deadline for the decision. Predictably, the cut off spurred a huge outflow of capital from the Greek banking system, destabilizing the economy and sending financial markets plummeting. More intimidation followed, including a slightly veiled threat that Emergency Liquidity Assistance – Greece's last credit lifeline from the ECB – could also be cut.

Dean Baker writes at Beat the Press today: ""Okay, for the 64,512th time, it is net exports that contribute to GDP, not exports. Apparently this distinction is difficult for people involved in economic policy to understand since they keep making the same mistake.

""The point is straightforward. If the United States increases its exports because GM is exporting car parts to be assembled in Mexico and then imported back as a finished car to the United States, it will not be a net job creator. We used to have jobs at assembly plants in the United States. These are being replaced by jobs in assembly plants in Mexico. In this story exports increase, but net exports (exports minus imports) fall. Fans of intro econ know the accounting identity that GDP = C + I + G +(X-M), where the X-M stands for exports minus imports.

""This is why the NYT seriously misled readers in an article on the impact of the rising dollar when it wrote:

""'the sharp rise of the dollar threatens to undercut one of the principal drivers of the recovery in recent years: strong export growth for American companies.'

""While exports have been a positive for growth, imports have been an even larger negative. According to our good friends at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (Table 1.1.2), the fall in net exports reduced growth by 0.22 percentage points in 2014. They added the same amount to growth in 2013, but have been a net negative since 2010.

Over the last few weeks, the White House's go-to guy on Latin America has made every effort to persuade Congress to approve a $1 billion aid request for Central America.  In separate op-eds in The New York Times and The Hill, Biden has argued that this money could help jump start the region economically and pave the way for 'the next great success story of the Western Hemisphere.'   But Biden's billion-dollar plan has already encountered resistance in Congress, and from fellow Democrats no less.  'We've spent billions of dollars there over two decades,' Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) recently noted. 'And we've seen conditions get worse in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador.'

""There is no doubt that these three countries – often referred to as Central America's Northern Triangle – could use some outside help.  Appalling levels of violence and dire economic conditions have led increasing numbers of Guatemalan, Honduran and Salvadoran citizens, including tens of thousands of children, to flee to neighboring countries and the U.S.  The Biden plan's apparent objective is to prevent these countries from spiraling into further economic and social turmoil.  But is there anything to suggest that the proposed aid package will work, when past assistance clearly hasn't?  

""Funding for development assistance to Central America is set to increase by nearly 400% under the Biden plan, with most of the funds going to the Northern Triangle.  The White House's budget request states that much of this funding is designed to 'support the priority objectives' identified in the 'Alliance for Prosperity' plan that the Inter-American Development Bank helped the three governments draft last year.  Among these objectives are much-needed investments in education, health and housing.""

12350395521_10153205827115522,"Are the new US sanctions against Venezuela incompatible with the easing of restrictions on Cuba? CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot writes at US News & World Report: ""Since the Obama administration decided last week to impose new sanctions on Venezuela, many people, including journalists, have inquired as to what motivated them to do this. Some are curious as to the apparent incongruity between this move and the White House decision in December to begin the process of normalizing relations with Cuba. Others are wondering why the administration would do something that so obviously hurts the opposition in Venezuela, at least in the short run. The main opposition group, the Democratic Unity Roundtable, issued a statement that did not support the sanctions: 'Venezuela is not a threat to anyone,' it said in response to the White House's absurd claim that Venezuela posed an 'extraordinary threat' to U.S. national security. And then there is the problem of Washington's isolation in the hemisphere, which has certainly increased with this latest move.

""The contradiction between the Venezuela sanctions and the opening to Cuba is probably more apparent than real. A majority of the U.S. foreign policy establishment has wanted to normalize relations with Cuba since at least the 1990s. There is money to be made there, and most of those interested in getting rid of the Cuban government seem to believe – correctly or not – that it will be easier to do so if the island is opened up to commercial relations with the U.S. So beginning to normalize relations with Cuba is generally consistent with the broader strategy of opposition to Venezuela and other left governments that have been elected and re-elected since 1998.""

12350395521_10153202988900522,"PRESS RELEASE: Today's election of Luis Almagro as the new Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) is ""another indication of declining U.S. influence in Latin America,"" Center for Economic and Policy Research Co-Director Mark Weisbrot said today. As foreign minister of Uruguay from 2010—2015, Almagro was involved in strengthening regional integration through organizations such as the Union of South American Nations and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. Almagro finished the race unopposed, but he previously had been running against the former foreign minister of Guatemala, Eduardo Stein. Stein received the backing of countries such as Honduras, Panama and the Dominican Republic prior to withdrawing his candidacy, while Almagro received strong support from South American nations, including Colombia.

""Historically, the U.S. has had an outsized role in influencing the major decisions made by the OAS, but that has been shrinking rapidly,"" Weisbrot said. ""The U.S. would certainly prefer to have a Secretary General who would do what it wanted and apply a double standard on human rights in accordance with U.S. policy – as Stein had signaled he might do. Almagro's election represents instead a triumph for regional integration and solidarity that opposes U.S. efforts to isolate particular countries.

""Perhaps even more importantly, CELAC and UNASUR are increasingly the venues where major decisions are made, and these are institutions that exclude the United States.""

Since UNASUR was formed, it has been used to respond to crises such as coups or coup attempts in Ecuador (2010) and Paraguay (2012), and separatist opposition efforts that threatened to destabilize the Bolivian government in 2008. The impetus for CELAC, meanwhile, arose out of governments' frustration after attempts to overturn the 2009 coup d'etat in Honduras were blocked at the OAS by the Obama administration.

Bush was, but hardly anyone who depends on the major hemispheric media would know that, because the point of view of governments other than the U.S. is not reported.

'It ought to be a joke in bad taste that reminds us of the darkest hours of our America, when we received invasions and dictatorships imposed by the imperialists,' Mr. Correa wrote. 'Can't they understand that Latin America has changed?'

""The last line really sums up the situation: They really don't understand that Latin America has changed.  One can follow all the foreign policy debates in Washington about Latin America, in the media or in journals such as Foreign Affairs, and there really is almost no acknowledgment of the new reality.

CEPR's Eileen Appelbaum recently spoke with the Huffington post about paid family leave policies and Vodafone's decision to offer paid leave to new mothers:

Large companies can afford to offer paid leave because the cost of losing one worker can be shared by many employees -- and is lower than the cost of replacing a worker who doesn't return after having a baby, she said. The calculus is very different for an employer with a higher percentage of female workers and a smaller workforce.

""It's great that Vodafone is doing this, but this isn't the way to go in general,"" she said.

Instead, Appelbaum said, the government should step up. In an ideal scenario, all workers would share the costs of mandated family leave via a payroll tax. For example, in New Jersey, workers contribute one-tenth of 1 percent out of their weekly pay to fund paid leave, Appelbaum said. Other states could copy this type of strategy.

""Paid leave is cheap. It's ridiculous that every state doesn't have it,"" she said.

'The first is macro economic. An over-valued dollar makes U.S. goods and services less competitive internationally. If the dollar is over-valued by 20 percent against other currencies then it has the same impact as if we were to impose a 20 percent tariff on all our exports and give a 20 percent subsidy on imported goods. Needless to say, this leads to a much larger trade deficit than would be the case if the currency were not over-valued.

""The trade deficit creates a gap in demand. The deficit is currently around 3.0 percent of GDP or $540 billion a year. This is money creating demand in other countries, not in the United States. There is no easy way to make up this shortfall in demand. Investment and consumption will not conveniently rise to fill the gap. We could in principle fill the gap with larger budget deficits, but given religious views about balanced budgets among people in power, that is not going to happen.

'This means that an over-valued dollar is likely to lead to major shortfalls in demand and unemployment. Or, to use the term currently popular among econ policy wonks, it leads to 'secular stagnation.'

""The other issue is distributional. An over-valued dollar hurts the workers who are subject to international competition to the benefit of workers who are largely protected from international competition. Textile workers and autoworkers take it on the chin, while doctors and lawyers, who ensure that trade agreements don't subject them to international competition end up benefiting. They get lower cost imports, without experiencing any downward pressure on their wages. (Businesses like Walmart and GE, who import much of what they sell in the U.S., are also big beneficiaries.)""

Politicians who are serious about the nation's prosperity and its citizens' welfare, it is accepted, need to be 'pro-business'.

""But what does it mean to be pro-business? First, we should not confuse a pro-business stance with a pro-rich stance. Not all rich people are business people, or 'wealth creators', as they are often called these days. Some of them have simply inherited vast sums of money, while others have created wealth elsewhere and are simply enjoying their lives in the UK.

""These people of course spend money and indirectly create jobs and income in that process. But job – and income – creation through consumption can be done by anyone, if they are given money. Indeed, you could argue that poorer people are more effective in this regard, as they tend to spend a higher share of their income, creating more demands for business. Thus transferring income from the 'idle rich' to poorer sections of society through taxation may actually be a pro-business policy.

""Then we need to separate the chaff from the wheat. Being pro-business doesn't – and shouldn't – mean leniency towards illegal or semi-legal activities by business people and companies, as some Tory party donors and rightwing newspapers want it to mean.""

Ha-Joon Chang is one of the world's best-known and most influential economists. A native of South Korea, he is the author of a series of international best-selling books that have inspired a new generation to rethink economics by challenging economic orthodoxy. Last year, Chang was voted one of the top 10 world thinkers by readers of the U.K.-based Prospect magazine. His books, including ""Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism,"" and ""23 Things They Don't Teach You About Capitalism,"" have been translated into dozens of languages. He has also advised numerous U.N. agencies, institutions, corporations, NGOs, and governments on economic policy. Chang teaches economics at Cambridge University in London. Dan Beeton interviewed him in Washington, D.C. when Chang was promoting his latest book, ""Economics: The User's Guide"" (Bloomsbury).

Dan Beeton: The so-called ""pink tide"" of left-leaning governments that have emerged in Latin America over the past 15 years have often pursued economic policies that go against the so-called Washington Consensus neoliberal policies of reduced social spending, privatization, trade liberalization and so on. How would you characterize these countries' progress? Do you think there are success stories here that other countries might want to ponder?

Ha-Joon Chang: In the 80s and 90s, all the Latin American countries followed the Washington Consensus policy and throughout those decades Latin America hardly grew at all—despite all the promises that if you follow these policies you'll grow fast and foreigners will invest. Those promises haven't been kept and a lot of countries got disillusioned, and from the late '90s to early 2000s started electing governments that departed from the Washington Consensus policies.

Alexander Main, CEPR's Senior Associate for International Policy, writes in a new article for NACLA: ""On January 29, the White House announced that $1 billion in assistance to Central America would be included in its budget request for fiscal year 2016. The goal of this aid, as Vice President Joe Biden described it in a New York Times op-ed, is to help the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras 'change the climate of endemic violence and poverty' that has led to a 'dangerous surge in migration,' as exemplified by last summer's influx of unaccompanied child migrants. Explicitly modeled on Plan Colombia, the aid package would help make the region 'overwhelmingly middle class, democratic and secure.'

""Central Americans may well greet Biden's assertions with skepticism. From the U.S.-backed dirty wars of the 1980s to the broken promises of economic development under the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the historical record shows that U.S. policies and assistance have often undermined prosperity, stability, and democracy in the region. More recently, human rights advocates have expressed deep concern [PDF] regarding the marked increase in U.S. military and police assistance to Central America's poor and crime-ridden Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras) since the mid 2000s. Though the purported objectives of this assistance are to fight drug trafficking and enhance 
'citizen security,' Honduras is today the deadliest country in the world, while El Salvador and Guatemala have higher murder rates than during their respective civil wars. Meanwhile, the flow of cocaine through Central America's drug-trafficking corridor has actually continued to rise, according to the State Department's own figures.""

But the initial crisis could have been resolved relatively quickly. In the United States, which was hit by the explosion of an $8 trillion housing bubble, our recession lasted just 18 months. In Greece it has been six years, with a loss of a quarter of its national income, and more than 25 percent unemployment (and twice that for youth).

""By now it is clear not only to the majority of economists, but to most people who are paying attention that this long depression was not only unnecessary but caused directly by bad policies. The Greek government implemented budget tightening that shrank the economy and worsened the debt burden – which has gone from 115 percent of GDP before the Greeks signed their first agreement with the IMF in 2010, to more than 170 percent today. At the same time, the European Central Bank (ECB), which could have helped Greece by keeping its borrowing costs down, allowed Greece's interest rates to soar, provoking a prolonged crisis not only for Greece but for the eurozone.  As a result, the unemployment rate in the 19-country eurozone is still twice that of the United States today.

""All of this was due more to political than to economic motives. It was not financial markets or even the big banks that drove this disaster, but European officials who prolonged the financial crisis in 2011 and 2012 and used it to try to remake the economies of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy more to their liking.""

Greek government officials reached a deal with European authorities earlier today to allow bailout funds to be extended to Greece for another four months. As The Guardian and other outlets have reported, the new Greek government agreed to submit a list of reforms to the European authorities on Monday.  But the agreement gives Greece fiscal flexibility, lowering previous fiscal surplus constraints. Bloomberg cited a Greek official as saying that tax increases and cuts to pensions were not part of the agreement. The accord forestalls the immediate threat of Greece being forced out of the eurozone through a loss of support from the European Central Bank (ECB).

""European officials had a gun to the head of the Greek government, and they just pulled it away – at least for now,"" Weisbrot said. ""This is a significant retreat and shows that their austerity program, which has failed miserably, is no longer politically enforceable. The Greek election has been shown to be a turning point for Europe.""

Weisbrot was referring to European officials' threat to collapse the Greek financial system by cutting off needed credit.  On February 4, the ECB announced that Greek government bonds could no longer be used as collateral for the least expensive loans from the ECB. Greece was still eligible for Emergency Liquidity Assistance, but last week European officials indicated that this too would be cut off if Greece did not agree to continue implementing the terms of previous governments' agreements.

The 1,179-mile pipeline extension would carry some of the world's dirtiest oil from the tar sands of Alberta, Canada to the Gulf Coast of Texas. And it shouldn't be necessary to repeat this, but since we have a Congress controlled by a party that denies the reality of climate change, it is:  97 percent of climate scientists agree that human activity has warmed the Earth. The evidence of climate disruption is all around us, from warming ocean surface and land temperatures, melting Antarctic ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, and increasing heat waves and other changes in extreme weather events.

""Supporters of the pipeline have tried to argue that the oil from Canada's tar sands will be exploited anyway, with or without the pipeline. There wasn't much to that argument a year ago, but after a 50 percent fall in oil prices, there is nothing left of it. This oil is expensive to produce, and without a guarantee of cheap transportation, oil companies are not going to invest in expanding production in the 170-billion barrel reserves of Canada's tar sands.""

Although Greece would still be eligible for other, emergency lending from the Central Bank, the immediate effect of the announcement was to raise Greek borrowing costs and squeeze its banks, and to increase financial market instability within Greece.

""We should be clear about what this means.  The ECB's move was completely unnecessary, and it was done some weeks before any decision had to be made.  It looks very much like a deliberate attempt to undermine the new government.  They are trying to force the government to abandon its promises to the Greek electorate, and to follow the IMF program that its predecessors signed on to.

""Clarity is important here because the European authorities, or the troika as they are commonly called, plunged the eurozone into at least two additional years of unnecessary recession that began in 2011 because they were playing a similar game of chicken. The ECB, for its part, deliberately and repeatedly allowed the eurozone to go the brink of financial meltdown during this period. It was not because the financial markets had the power to collapse the euro when they pushed the yield on the 10-year sovereign bonds of Italy and Spain to unsustainable levels in the range of 7 percent. It was because the ECB deliberately allowed these market actors to create an existential crisis for the euro, in order to force concessions from the governments of Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Ireland.""

Syriza has promised to enact alternative policy measures to the spending cuts and other regressive measures that the European authorities have imposed on Greece. Eurozone policies have left Greece with extremely high unemployment -- currently at 25.5 percent, with youth unemployment at 49.6 percent – depression levels of output (down by about 26 percent from pre-recession levels), and a very weak and precarious recovery, as noted in a new CEPR paper. The IMF has projected that Greek unemployment will still be at nearly 16 percent in 2018, and almost all of their projections since 2010 have been over-optimistic.

""This is a great example for the rest of the eurozone,"" Weisbrot said. ""Voters have rejected prolonged mass unemployment and elected a new government with a mandate to negotiate a better deal.

12350395521_10152134828010522,"It's that time of year again, the time when we ask all of our friends to support CEPR with a year-end donation. Thanks to all of you who have supported us this year and in years past. We really do rely on your donations to help fund our research, analysis, outreach, publications – everything we do.

We promise to use your gift wisely. And we promise that your gift will make a difference. This past year, CEPR (with the help of our progressive allies) changed the way the New York Times reports on budget numbers. We also prevented Larry Summers from becoming Fed Chair;  saved Social Security from cuts; shot down opponents of raising the minimum wage and paid sick days; stopped a march to war with Syria; made the IMF stop and listen; called for the U.N. to take responsibility for bringing cholera to Haiti and we pushed back against austerity in the eurozone. Not bad for being outspent and outnumbered.

We need your help to continue to promote policies that benefit the people most harmed by the rise in inequality, both here and abroad. We still have lots of work to do. Please, click here and help us to make that list even longer next year.  

Best wishes for a healthy holiday season and a very happy new year,
Dean, Mark and CEPR Staff (including dogs)

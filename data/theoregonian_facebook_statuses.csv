6321831972_10154478014366973,"Orange & Dark Chocolate Pound Cake: YUM! http://trib.al/1CkPfok

For the cake:
1 cup butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan
2 cups sugar
2 oranges, zested
4 eggs
1 cup buttermilk* 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups dark chocolate chips
* If you don't have buttermilk, combine 1 cup regular milk with 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lemon juice. Let thicken for five minutes.

For the sauce:
1 cup confectioners sugar 
2 oranges, juiced
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter

Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Grease a nine-inch square pan well with butter or nonstick baking spray.

First the cake. Place the butter, sugar, and orange zest in a large mixing bowl. Use an electric hand mixer to combine the ingredients until light and fluffy. Then, add the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the vanilla extract, followed by the buttermilk.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk well to evenly distribute the ingredients.

Slowly add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined, and then stir in the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the greased pan. Smooth the top with a spatula.

Place the pan in the oven and bake for 55-65 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean.

Meanwhile, make the butter sauce. Combine the confectioners sugar, orange juice, and remaining butter with a whisk in a small sauce pan. Heat over a medium flame until melted and thick; do not boil.

Use a long skewer to poke many holes in the cake. Slowly spoon the butter sauce over the cake, pausing to let the sauce absorb into the cake.

Let the cake cool completely. Slice and serve.

This recipe will yield one cake with about twelve slices.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theoregonian/photos/a.190854036972.129405.6321831972/10154478014366973/?type=3,2017-02-21 22:28:10,26,5,14,22,1,3,0,0,0

⠀
He remembers the soldiers with their rifles. The tower guards with their searchlights. The tarpaper barrack he lived in with his uncles, mother and siblings. The rough, unfinished wood floors.⠀
⠀
He pictures childhood friends and games played in the dust. Empty thread spools fashioned into makeshift toy cars, and tiddlywinks made from milk cartons. And the camp rule he learned quickly and early on: Never venture beyond the barbed wire.⠀
⠀
He is my grandfather. Sam Matsumoto spent four years in a remote desert internment camp on the Oregon-California border during World War II, part of a West Coast roundup that sent more than 100,000 people - two-thirds of them American citizens - to confinement because of their Japanese heritage.⠀
⠀
His family - and the family of his future wife, my grandmother Harriet Matsumoto - were forced from their Sacramento-area homes to the Tule Lake camp, which at its peak held more than 18,000 people. With wartime fear racing through the nation, the Japanese were told they were enemies of the country. They were charged with no crime and given no due process.⠀
⠀
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order 9066 on Feb. 19, 1942, set the roundups into motion. It authorized regional Army commanders to remove anyone from ""military areas"" - ultimately the entire West Coast -- as they saw fit. Within six months of the executive order, all people of Japanese ancestry were evacuated from their homes and taken to one of 10 remote camps.""⠀

⠀
Oregon is a veritable well of natural hot springs, offering a warm romantic respite on a chilly day. You can find a neat series of rustic and built-up hot springs in the national forests along the Cascade Mountains, but another batch dots the desert landscape of southeast Oregon as well. Just a heads up: Many of the more rustic hot springs are clothing optional.⠀

A bullet from his own gun - wrested away by the suspect - hit Cordova's right leg and shrapnel damaged his left leg. He couldn't move his right leg for about a month afterward and still has bits of shrapnel in his other leg, he said.

⠀
The Portland State University graduate student moved to the United States from Iran a decade ago. She has been trying ever since to bring her sister, Mona Asadizadeh, to live with her.⠀
⠀
Mona traveled to Turkey and back for interviews with embassy officials. She filled out reams of paperwork. A few months ago, her visa application was approved.⠀
⠀
When she tried to board a plane last week, a guard stopped her. President Donald Trump temporarily banned visitors from Iran and six other Muslim majority countries.⠀
⠀
Mona's visa required her to make it to the United States by April 11 -- before the travel ban expired. Mania believed she might never see her sister again.⠀
⠀
Their fates began to change last week when Washington's attorney general filed a lawsuit against Trump, calling the travel ban illegal and unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee in Seattle, issued a temporary order Friday banning enforcement nationwide of the travel ban.⠀

⠀
#punxsutawneyphil, the Pennsylvania groundhog who garners the spotlight every #GroundhogDay, was flat wrong, local sources said.⠀
⠀
A hog of the hedge variety, the @oregonzoo's own winter-predicting rodent FuFu, failed to see her shadow Thursday morning, meaning here in the Pacific Northwest, we are in for an early #spring.⠀
⠀
Animal curator Tanya Paul, who oversaw Thursday's prediction, said groundhogs aren't even the original animals used to predict the onset of spring, so anything Phil says should be taken with a grain of salt, assuming they aren't using all of it on their icy highways.⠀
⠀
""Groundhogs like Punxsutawney Phil are relative newcomers to the game,"" Paul said. ""According to folklore, the Europeans who originated the tradition originally used #hedgehogs. When they immigrated to the United States, they realized their new home didn't have hedgehogs, so they turned to the groundhog out of necessity. But FuFu is bringing the holiday back to its origins.""⠀
⠀
Not only are hedgehogs the original weather predictors, they're also better at it, Paul said. Phil's predictions have been accurate about 39 percent of the time, the zoo said, while our own rodents are closer to 50 percent.⠀
⠀
""The zoo's hedgehogs have fared slightly better than Punxsutawney Phil -- which admittedly is not that great,"" Paul said in a statement. ""Last year though, our hedgehog Velda did predict an early spring, which was pretty accurate for this region. We had the warmest February and April on record.""",,video,https://www.facebook.com/theoregonian/videos/10154420607651973/,2017-02-02 15:38:42,273,32,108,219,33,0,20,0,1

6321831972_10154420134426973,"Ursula K Leguin: ""A recent letter in The Oregonian compares a politician's claim to tell 'alternative facts' to the inventions of science fiction. The comparison won't work. We fiction writers make up stuff. Some of it clearly impossible, some of it realistic, but none of it real - all invented, imagined --  and we call it fiction because it isn't fact. We may call some of it 'alternative history' or 'an alternate universe,' but make absolutely no pretense that our fictions are 'alternative facts.'

Facts aren't all that easy to come by. Honest scientists and journalists, among others, spend a lot of time trying to make sure of them.  The test of a fact is that it simply is so - it has no 'alternative.'  The sun rises in the east.  To pretend the sun can rise in the west is a fiction, to claim that it does so as fact (or 'alternative fact') is a lie.

A lie is a non-fact deliberately told as fact.  Lies are told in order to reassure oneself, or to fool, or scare, or manipulate others. Santa Claus is a fiction.  He's harmless. Lies are seldom completely harmless, and often very dangerous.  In most times, most places, by most people, liars are considered contemptible.""",Ursula Le Guin on fiction vs. 'alternative facts': Letter to the editor,link,http://trib.al/neKZmNG,2017-02-02 12:51:27,944,29,493,754,180,8,1,1,0

We make trips to their highest slopes. We drink water from their glacial melt. We can see their silhouettes when we close our eyes. Here's to the many #mountains of #Oregon, a part of our souls from near or from far.⠀
⠀
Here's how Oregon's mountains got their names: #MountHood⠀
⠀
Oregon's highest peak was named for Lord Samuel Hood, a British naval officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War. In 1792, Lieutenant William Broughton, sailing with George Vancouver, named the peak for him.⠀
⠀
Mount Hood was called #Wyeast by the #Multnomah tribe prior to Vancouver's arrival.⠀

Divine Deviled Eggs With Fresh Rosemary
Makes 24 servings

Ingredients
12 medium eggs, hard-cooked and peeled
6 tablespoons light mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
Instructions
Slice each egg in half lengthwise and scoop out the yolks into a medium bowl. Place the whites on a plate or tray and set aside.

Mix the remaining ingredients into the yolks with a fork, mashing the yolks until it forms a somewhat smooth paste.

Using a pastry bag and decorative tip or a zipper-top bag with one end snipped, swirl the yolk filling back into the egg white halves. Serve at once, or cover and refrigerate for up to 12 hours.

Meet Keenan Browne, 27, who was born with tunnel vision and is legally blind. He says it's worsened over the years. He can see only a very small area in the center of his line of sight. At night he can't see anything. Browne is thankful for having his own place to live - a room in the downtown Portland's Stewart Hotel. Browne, who was homeless for five years, said his situation was especially miserable during the cold and rainy seasons. When he would find a warm place to stay, someone would always tell him to go away. He bruised his shins from running into things. He said it was both humbling and embarrassing. Still, Browne knew many people had it worse than he did. Browne is especially thankful for his good friend from Kentucky who supported him while he was getting his Social Security back on track so he could afford rent. ""It's really beautiful to have your own keys,"" Browne says.

Ginny Prior writes: When you think of Northern California, cowboys and cattle drives are probably not the first things that pop into your mind. But there's a place outside Redding that perfectly captures the romance of the Old West. It's the Wild Horse Sanctuary near Shingletown, about a half-hour's drive from Lassen Volcanic National Park. Here, on 5,000 acres of mountain meadow and forest, 300 wild mustangs roam freely across a rugged land with soaring vistas and sky as big as a Montana sunset.

Chuck Barney writes: Season 1 of ""Glee"" had

http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_15363545

Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies are asking anyone who recognizes a distinctive logo on a bank robber's T-shirt to call in and identify a muscular, bald man who walked into a Comerica Bank on Tuesday in Saratoga and biked off with a bundle of cash.

Sgt. Rick Sung also said the robber might have red dye all over his fingers and clothes, as the bank teller secretly slipped a red dye pack into the stack of stolen cash.

The suspect, who may have been armed, entered the bank on Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road about 3:30 p.m. and handed the teller a note indicating he was robbing the bank, authorities said.

Video surveillance inside the bank shows clear pictures of a white man in good athletic shape with a shaved head, sunglasses, white shorts and athletic shoes. He looks to be 6 feet 2 inches tall and 230 pounds and perhaps in his late 30s. The background of the shirt he's wearing is dark blue or black, and the logo looks possibly like a shield with either swords or lacrosse sticks crossing over each other to make an X.

The suspect was last seen on a mountain bike. Authorities also believe, without disclosing further detail, that he may have committed a similar robbery at a Bank of the West branch in San Jose on Saturday.

Anyone with information on this incident can call Sgt. Herman Leon at 408-808-4500 during normal business hours or 408-808-4410 after hours. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call the sheriff's tip line at 408-808-4431.

President Barack Obama sacked Gen. Stanley McChrystal as his top commander in Afghanistan and will replace him with Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, a senior administration official said. McChrystal was pushed out over his blistering remarks about administration officials, quoted in a Rolling Stone magazine interview.

This year, the Year of the Tiger in China, has brought an interest in the dyeing trend — with tigers being the most-sought-after look. From golden retrievers to Pekingese, pets are not just being dyed basic colors but are being transformed to look like other animals

DAVID CRARY,Associated Press

The first World Cup ever held in Africa opened Friday in a dazzling burst of joy, color and noise — and just a tinge of sadness.

Before a jubilant, horn-blowing crowd at Soccer City, the spectacular stadium between Johannesburg and Soweto, hundreds of African dancers in vivid greens, reds and yellows paraded onto the field for the opening ceremony of the month-long tournament.

Most of the fans were in the yellow jerseys of Bafana Bafana, the host country's team, which was playing Mexico following the pageantry.

The elation was tempered by news that Nelson Mandela, the revered anti-apartheid leader and former president, would not attend the ceremony. The 91-year-old Mandela is frail and decided not to come after his 13-year-old great-granddaughter was killed in a car crash on the way home from Thursday night's World Cup concert.

Several other icons of the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa were on hand — including Mandela's former wife, Winnie, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who at one point was dancing in his seat to the music.",World Cup opening ceremony dazzles,photo,https://www.facebook.com/mercurynews/photos/a.442234791336.216935.63095136336/442236616336/?type=3,2010-06-11 11:10:57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When you see a red meter downtown in the next couple months, don't put coins in it if you think you're paying to park.

But do put money in it if you want to fund outreach services for panhandlers.

On Tuesday, the City Council unanimously approved bringing meters from the 1950s out of retirement for a new program called Imagine Positive Change. Up to eight meters featuring a metal corona saying ""Imagine"" will be placed on
 highly visible corners on Pacific Avenue to collect change for bus fare, state IDs and other ways to help panhandlers.

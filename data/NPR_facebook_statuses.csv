10643211755_10154392332431756,"The village of Kangeq, Greenland, was famous for its strong Inuit hunters and good location at the mouth of a fjord. It was where the first Scandinavian missionaries settled, the first Greenlandic artists painted and some of the last traditional Inuit kayak hunters braved the ocean. But the Danish government decided in 1974 to remove the village from the list of towns in Greenland. It would be much easier if the Inuit people moved to larger towns where the infrastructure was already in place. This was devastating to the residents of Kangeq. 

Like native people all around the Arctic — and all over the world — Greenlanders are seeing the deadly effects of rapid modernization and cultural interference. American Indians and Alaska Natives have seen many of their communities buckle under the same pressures. The shuttering of Kangeq left deep scars on the former residents. In the decade after they were moved to an apartment block in the capital city of Nuuk, more than 10 of them took their own lives. ""Almost all the young men,"" says Anda Poulsen, who grew up in the town.

One approach it takes is to use community ""ambassadors"" to reach out to people before they get sick, and then help them stay out of clinics going forward.

City Health Works hires people like Norma Melendez to be those ambassadors.

""I live in this immediate neighborhood, so I can relate to a lot of the people who live in my community,"" says Melendez. ""I've faced many of the similar barriers once upon a time, or someone I know has faced these similar barriers."" 

Melendez does not have a medical background. She's what City Health Works calls a health coach. Her job is to work with patients after they've visited the clinic. She goes to their homes, makes sure they have the medicine, makes sure they take it, and shows them how to stay on a diet their doctor has ordered. These may seem like easy tasks, but they aren't, especially when you don't have a lot of money.

10643211755_10152931231036756,"A lot of computing pioneers were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. 

But in 1984, the percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

What happened?

Here's a good starting place: The number started falling at roughly the same time that personal computers began showing up in U.S. homes. Those early computers weren't much more than toys marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

Movies like ""Weird Science,"" Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""War Games"" all came out in the '80s. The plot summaries are almost interchangeable: awkward geek boy genius uses tech savvy to triumph over adversity and win girl.

The idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.

In the 1990s, research showed that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.

This was a big deal when those kids got to college.

10643211755_10152917025016756,"You may not know the name Homer Laughlin, a china factory in Newell, W.Va., but you'll likely recognize — or have eaten off of — its most famous product: brightly colored, informal pottery called Fiesta.

While most of America's china factories have closed, unable to compete with ""made in China"" or Japan or Mexico, Homer Laughlin, which set up shop on the banks of the Ohio River in 1873, is still going strong. It employs about 1,000 people.

""I'm just a hand liner. I put lines on,"" says Kevin Manypenny. He's been working here nearly 40 years.

He twirls a plate, dips a brush in brown glaze and paints three delicate lines on the plate's edge. Fiesta is about half of Homer Laughlin's business — the other half is dinnerware for hotels, and the sturdy plates and cups you find at chain restaurants.

Manypenny and seven of his eight siblings — and their parents — have worked at this factory. And there are dozens of families like theirs.

In the 1930s, the company created Fiesta: inexpensive, colorful, cheerful dinnerware. It was a hit even during the Depression.

""I remember the first time I actually went to the facility, and I'm looking around and I'm thinking, 'Boy, am I back in the 1940s or what?'"" says Bruce Smith, the head of the union representing the pottery workers. He says while nothing about Homer Laughlin is flashy, the workers do make decent money.

""They're good jobs and they're making a living, being able to buy a home and raise a family and retire with some dignity,"" Smith says.

It's part of the nation's ""cultural sustainability to preserve these things,"" Chanin says, ""to be able to make our clothes.""

Chanin runs ""The Factory"" in Florence, a small town tucked in the northwest corner of Alabama. The Factory employs about 30 people, including local experienced seamstresses. Chanin's business partner, Billy Reid, is also a designer in Florence.

Another partner of Reid's asked Chanin a question: ""Can we go from seed to finished product in the same community?"" And organically?

Reid says it meant growing cotton with no pesticides, no herbicides and no farm equipment tainted by such chemicals.

""So many people were betting against us and saying, 'You can't grow cotton unless you use pesticides. The bugs will eat it. It will be gone,'"" Chanin says.

But when harvest came, they proved the naysayers wrong.

Chanin holds a piece of ivory-colored fabric spun from the hand-picked cotton grown in the Alabama field.

""I've never seen cotton quite as clean and clear as this,"" Chanin says. ""I mean, cotton has a really ugly history… It has built fortunes, it's destroyed nations, it's enslaved people.

""She was the sister who gave me courage. Even at the Ebola treatment center, she was still there for me as a mother,"" Borlay says through an interpreter. ""She was encouraging me to eat well, take my drugs, drink a lot of water. But I learned that she was not doing what she encouraged me to do — and she died.""

Now Borlay doesn't have anybody else to look up to as a mother.

But she's finding a way to give back for her own survival, watching over Mamaya Kane, the 15-month-old baby girl strapped to her back. Borlay never met the infant's mother, who died of the virus. The baby's grandmother, she adds, was being cared for in the isolation unit.

""That's the reason I'm still at the Ebola treatment center, volunteering to take care of this baby,"" she tells NPR. ""The grandmother tested positive, but the baby tested negative, so Doctors Without Borders was looking for somebody to volunteer to take care of the baby.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/NPR/photos/a.315515951755.185285.10643211755/10152859013311756/?type=3,2014-09-25 15:21:02,24109,793,4422,24109,0,0,0,0,0

One really striking thing when you look at the list of the costliest storms is that six of the 10 costliest storms occurred between 2000 and 2010 — even after adjusting for inflation.  

Then again, as the report points out, our population and our cities are much bigger today than they were 100 years ago, and our standard of living is higher. A megastorm can destroy much more stuff today simply because there is much more stuff out there for it to destroy.

So the authors also look back at historical hurricanes and estimate how much damage they would be likely to do if they hit the same area in 2010. That picture looks quite different.

The SS Monte Carlo shipwreck is once again exposed on Coronado Beach, thanks to the recent storms and large surf - Coronado Landscape Photography

""Thanks to the recent storms and large surf the SS Monte Carlo shipwreck is once again exposed on Coronado Beach. For those unfamiliar with the shipwreck, the Monte Carlo was a gambling ship that traveled international waters off the coast of Coronado to avoid state and federal jurisdiction. During a storm on New Year's Day in 1937 the anchored ship drifted onto the beach in front of what is now the Coronado Shores condos. Because of the illegal activities that took place on the ship, no one claimed ownership and it was grounded for good. Some believe there is still treasure hidden inside the wreckage. The shipwreck can currently be viewed at low tide, until the surf slowly covers it with sand once again.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ABC10News/photos/a.312760942099728.67384.100450643330760/1406020382773773/?type=3,2017-01-28 15:02:00,3143,523,1139,2640,153,348,2,0,0

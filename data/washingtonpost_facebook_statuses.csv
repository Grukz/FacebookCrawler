""The Delayer"" is a tactic Trump uses while thinking of his next point.

Lawyers have concluded their oral arguments in one of the same-sex marriage cases before the Supreme Court.

Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper defended Prop 8, a California measure that defines marriage as between a man and a woman, by arguing that procreation is a vital state interest. Cooper said that since same-sex couples cannot have their own children, their marriages do not address this interest. 

Justice Kagan asked whether, if procreation were such a vital interest, marriage licences should not be issued to heterosexual couples over 55.

--------------

TRUE LOVE | Bill Ott will always remember the moment he met Shelley Belgard. It was in spring 1988. He was 12 and sometimes shy. Into music, sports and, suddenly, girls.

Shelley was three years older, chatty and outgoing. They'd both shown up at a Montgomery County social club looking for friends, fun and the kind of acceptance that seems so elusive during teen life.

Shelley smiled. Bill introduced himself. And that was it. ""I didn't know what love was,"" he says. ""Until I met her.""

He was sure it was the real thing, but nobody ever believes that coming from a 12-year-old.

Certainly not one with Down syndrome.

They have in the past been mistaken for UFOS.
In fact, these are lenticular clouds: saucer-shaped formations which typically gather over mountain peaks.
Seen here captured in various locations around the world, they form when strong, wet winds blow over rough terrain.
When the moist air flow encounters obstructions, such as landforms or buildings, standing waves in the atmosphere are created. As the air condenses, the odd-shaped clouds are made.
It's a relatively rare weather phenomenon, resulting in clouds that are stationary and lens-shaped, and sometimes resemble dramatic vortexes or tornadoes mid-strike.

Ma Maoting is a renowned silversmith in Fenghuang county, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture, Central #China's Hunan province. He has been in this trade for 43 years. Silver accessories were commonly used by people of the Miao ethnic minority in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture.

It's been an important custom for people of the Miao ethnic minority in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture to decorate themselves head to toe with silver on special occasions such as weddings. While being a silversmith was once a respected job, in recent years, the tradition is slowly dying as some of the younger generations believe cash is a better choice as betrothal gift. 

Many silversmiths have lost their jobs in recent years, but Ma decided to stay on. He was later awarded a national inheritor of Miao silver accessories, and many people came to ask him to build silver accessories. 

Ma generally starts work at 10 am after breakfast everyday and does not stop until evening when he has time to eat again. Ma said making silver accessories by hands is a continuous process, which is why it has been a common practice for silversmiths to not take a break for lunch.

The silver accessories are made by hand in a traditional way. A set of silver accessories takes him six months to finish and costs about 100,000 yuan ($14,541). http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0224/c90000-9182309.html","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1448515045200308/?type=3,2017-02-24 06:30:01,3518,46,70,3454,28,33,2,0,1

188625661189259_1448477485204064,"Bees are taught to play FOOTBALL: Smart insects reveal they can learn by watching others play a game

They are unlikely to trouble the Premier League any time soon, but bees have been taught by scientists to play football.
For the first time, insects have demonstrated they can learn a complex skill and improve upon it.
Bees learned football not for a Premier League salary but for sugar, released from a yellow ball every time they successfully pushed it to the middle of a 'pitch'.

But they showed for the first time they can learn by watching and, rather than copy what they have seen, change it to make it better. 
That skill has only previously been seen in humans, primates and marine mammals like dolphins.
A study by Queen Mary University of London found the insects, given a selection of balls, cleverly went for the closest even after watching demonstrator bees which always chose the furthest away.
Project supervisor and co-author Professor Lars Chittk, also from Queen Mary University of London, said: 'Our study puts the final nail in the coffin of the idea that small brains constrain insects to have limited behavioural flexibility and only simple learning abilities.' 

The study, published in the journal Science, placed bumblebees on a platform and trained them to move a yellow ball from the edge to the centre.
When they were successful, a trapdoor in the ball would open, releasing a delicious sugar solution as their reward.

To learn the technique, the bees were trained under one of three conditions. 
Some observed a previously trained bee move the furthest ball to the centre to gain reward, others received a 'ghost' demonstration, using a magnet to move the ball, and a third group received no demonstration, where they found the ball already at the centre of the platform with a reward.
The bees that observed the technique from a live bee or a plastic one, were more efficient, showing bees can be trained.
It builds on previous studies showing they can pull levers and strings to access food, but the new study shows for the first time they can perform behaviour not linked to their natural foraging habits which they normally do not need.

Joint lead author Dr Clint Perry, also from Queen Mary University of London, said: 'We wanted to explore the cognitive limits of bumblebees by testing whether they could use a non-natural object in a task likely never encountered before by any individual in the evolutionary history of bees.'
The insects further showed they could improve upon their learned behaviour by using differently coloured balls.
Joint lead author Dr Olli Loukola, from the university's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: 'This shows an impressive amount of cognitive flexibility, especially for an insect.'
He added: 'It may be that bumblebees, along with many other animals, have the cognitive capabilities to solve such complex tasks, but will only do so if environmental pressures are applied to necessitate such behaviours.'

Several unusual sea creatures have been washing up on the shores of the tropical islands following the deadly quake on Sunday. 

Images of the creature have since gone viral online, with several people offering up their suggestions as to what the monster could be.
Several suggested that the beast could be Appa, a fictional character from the Nickelodeon animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender. 
Austin Blanch‏@austinblanch tweeted saying: 'Yhink it's appa. Or a big Shitzu. I could be wrong.'
While another Twitter user, J Flow, said: 'It's that creature from The Neverending Story.'

John Paul Garcia suggested the beast may be similar to a supposed half-whale half-polar bear creature that washed up in Margate, South Africa, on 25 October 1924, which was nicknamed Trunko.
'Globster/Trunko right? Half whale half polar bear?' he said.
Globster is the name given to an unidentified organic mass that washes up on the shoreline of an ocean or other body of water.  

However, the beast is actually a 20 foot long whale carcass, local scientists have said.
The body of the whale, which weighs approximately 2,000 kilograms, is believed to have turned white due to an advanced stage of decomposition.
The animal is thought to have died approximately two weeks ago, possibly after being hit by a ship.

We all have lapses in judgement from time to time. 

But some of the people in these images really have taken a wrong turn when it comes to logic.

While it's difficult to judge the scenarios without the back stories, it's fair to say that jamming your leg into a tree shredder, for example, is definitely not the correct way to operate it.

Others are more understandable - like the woman using a digital camera back-to-front. She might at least get a decent shot of her own eyeball.

The seven exoplanets were all found in tight formation around an ultracool dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1. Estimates of their mass also indicate that they are rocky planets, rather than being gaseous like Jupiter. Three planets are in the habitable zone of the star, known as TRAPPIST-1e, f and g, and may even have oceans on the surface.

188625661189259_1446686378716508,"The heartbreaking story of the second chimp in history found to have 'Down syndrome': Blind 24 year old Kanako was abandoned by her mother and is unable to play with other animals

The second ever recorded case of a chimpanzee with trisomy 22 - a chromosomal defect similar to #Downsyndrome (trisomy 21) in humans - has been confirmed by Japanese researchers.
The chimp, named Kanako, is a 24-year-old female chimp born into captivity. 
In their study, the researchers explained how they improved the quality of life of the chimp by providing her with opportunities for normal social interaction. 

In humans, Down syndrome occurs due to a chromosomal abnormality. 
Normally, a human's cells has 23 pairs of chromosomes - to make a total of 46 chromosomes.
But people with down syndrome have an extra, third copy of the 21st chromosome - which is why the condition is also called trisomy 21.

Apes have 24 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 48 chromosomes. 
Apes such as chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans can develop a similar condition to Down syndrome called trisomy 22, when they have an additional third copy of chromosome 22. 
The first confirmed case of a chimpanzee with trisomy 22 was documented in 1969.

That chimp died before its second birthday - which means that Kanako is the longest living chimp with this chromosomal disorder that scientists know of. 
Kanako was born in captivity in 1992 in a sanctuary that was transferred to Kyoto University in 2011 and named Kumamoto Sanctuary, Wildlife Research Centre. 
When she was 156 days old, Kanako was separate from her mother, Kanae, while Kanae had to be anesthetized for a physical examination.
As the anesthesia was wearing off, Kanae bit her own tongue and had to recover alone for four days.
When Kanako and her mother were reunited, the mother didn't take care of Kanako.
After that, Kanako was hand-raised by human staff.
During her first year, Kanako frequently suffered from coughs, colds, fever, diarrhea and swelling around her right eye - although these symptoms are not uncommon in young chimpanzees. 
She experienced stunted growth from an early age and has congential heart disease, as well as underdeveloped teeth. 
Congenital heart disease is a heart defect that someone is born with - most are structural issues of the heart such as holes and leaky valves.  
But Kanako's heart problem was only discovered in 2014 during a routine physical exam. 
An echocardiogram, a test of the action of the heart using ultrasound waves, revealed that she has an atrial septal defect - a hole in the wall that separate the top two chambers of the heart. 
Kanako developed cataracts before the age of one and became blind by the time she turned 7. 
She's cross eyed and has a disorder that causes the gradual thinning of her corneas.

These types of health problems are also common in human's who have Down syndrome. 
Kanako's blindness makes it difficult for her to interact with other chimps, but not entirely impossible. 
She lived separately from other chimps to avoid aggressive interactions, but she was given the opportunity to interact with another female chimp named Roman once a month, who has been calm and friendly to Kanako since they first started interacting. 

Kanako's development wasn't systematically investigated over the years, so the researchers say they aren't certain if her condition has caused any specific mental retardation over the years. 
'However, the lack of abnormalities noted in her daily care-taking before the age of one, except for neonatal inactivity and limp limbs, suggests that there was no severe retardation in her behavioral development,' says Dr Satoshi Hirata, lead-author of the research paper and Director of the Kumamoto Sanctuary. 

It's still not clear how common trisomy 22 is among chimpanzees.
In 2015, reports from Tanzania about a mother caring for a baby chimp with Down syndrome couldn't be confirmed because chromosomal test couldn't be conducted.
'It is difficult to estimate the probability of a rare event using a small population, but given that around 500 chimpanzees have been born in captivity in Japan, the probability of this autosomal trisomy in chimpanzees may be comparable to that of trisomy 21 in humans, which occurs in up to 1 in 600 births,' said Dr Hirata.

43-year-old double hand amputee has decided to write a different future for himself, picking up calligraphy after losing his arms in an unfortunate accident over three decades ago.

Weijun from the city of Baoji in northwest #China's #Shaanxi Province spent the past 22 years making a living from calligraphy and creating a life that many have admired, although he has lost his two hands.

A high voltage electric shock at eight years old led to Jia losing his left arm and half of his right arm. The traumatized kid dropped out of school, but knew that life does not stop, and should not stop, at one's pains.

His parents tried to talk him out of leaving the nest to start earning a living, but Jia decided to embark on a journey that would take him in 1992 to the streets of Xi'an, the provincial capital of Shaanxi Province. He learned Chinese calligraphy and sold his artistic and intricate work to make ends meet.

A desk, a chair, several brushes and an ink slab are the tools Jia needs to create magic on fans.

Inspired and impressed by ancient Chinese prose, he spends two hours to decorate one item.

Life in Xi'an proved to be challenge to Jia, but the man was never discouraged, fighting to make a living.

In 2000, Jia tied the knot and his wife would soon be an incentive to carry on with calligraphy, supporting him unconditionally.

Jia's years of hard work eventually paid off, and he became a member of the Calligraphers Association of Shaanxi five years ago.

Jia practices calligraphy with the help of his wife and sells his work outside tourist attractions in the city.

A specially decorated plane will transport a giant panda that was born in the United States back to China on Tuesday.

Bao Bao, a female panda born in August 2013 at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., is the offspring of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who have lived at the zoo since 2000.

Under the agreement that is signed between China and foreign governments, any panda cub born to Chinese pandas that have been loaned to a foreign country must be returned to China within four years of its birth, according to Zhang Hemin, head of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan province.

Logistics company FedEx Express will provide a special crate for Bao Bao, who will be transported onboard a custom-decorated FedEx Express 777 Freighter, dubbed the ""FedEx Panda Express.""

The direct charter flight will fly nonstop from Washington's Dulles International Airport to Chengdu in Sichuan.

A keeper and a veterinarian from the Smithsonian's National Zoo will accompany Bao Bao onboard the aircraft, continuously monitoring her during the trip and providing a supply of fresh water, bamboo and her favorite treats, including apples, pears and cooked sweet potatoes.

Upon arrival in Chengdu, Bao Bao will be driven to the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda's base in Dujiangyan. The panda keeper from the Smithsonian will remain with Bao Bao for a short time while she acclimates to her new home. http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0222/c90000-9180893.html","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1446522302066249/?type=3,2017-02-21 20:30:00,4292,20,77,4222,52,13,3,1,1

Zhao Muhe is a 105-year-old man from Taiwan. Praised by many as an ideal role model, Zhao's motto is that it's never too late to learn. He is now auditing classes at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan as he prepares to earn a PhD, China Youth Online reported.

Zhao entered National Open University in Taiwan in 1999. He commuted to school by bike every day, never missing a single class. He studied late into the night, and it only took Zhao four years to finish the 128 academic credits required to graduate, which he did at the age of 91.

Several years later, Zhao decided to continue his studies. He passed the entrance examination for Nanhua University in Taiwan and got a master's degree two years later. The 98-year-old set a Guinness World Record as the oldest postgraduate student in the world.

In 2015, Zhao started classes at National Tsing Hua University. He lives alone on the fourth floor of an old apartment building. He does his own shopping, cooking and laundry, refusing help because he claims it would make him feel old.

Zhao was born in Shandong province in 1912. Influenced by traditional Chinese culture, he studied at a private school and started to study calligraphy when he was 14. Years of practice made him a calligraphy master. Over the decades, he has donated huge sums of money raised by calligraphy charities to people in need.

Zhao held a calligraphy exhibition in Hong Kong in 2012, and also published an autobiography. As he couldn't use a computer at the time, the autobiography was written by Fang Yahui, based on Zhao's oral narration. After the book was written, Zhao decided that he should learn how to navigate the internet; now he buys his own tickets online. http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0220/c90000-9180269.html","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1445574458827700/?type=3,2017-02-20 21:30:00,2742,40,195,2657,42,38,2,1,2

To take the photographs for the scenes McCor reveals that he was taken behind the scenes of the airport – and it was apparently a bit hair-raising at times, with large airliners blowing over his equipment.
He said: 'I've been very lucky that my style of photography has taken me all over the world – New York, Hong Kong, Dubai. Having flown out of Gatwick Airport countless times, last month I was fortunate enough to go behind the scenes at the airport which meant wearing a fetching high-vis jacket, having my tripod blown over by an A380, deciphering radio messages from the control tower and being driven around the runway like a boss all whilst taking photos with my cut-outs.
'It was genuinely one of the most fun experiences I've had. Except having to fix my tripod close to the runway.'
McCor was commissioned by the airport to create something that reflected its long-haul routes, which are booming at the moment.
It reported that this January saw a 23.2 per cent increase in passenger numbers for long-haul destinations on January 2016.
McCor's previous work includes turning the London Eye into a bicycle, Big Ben into a watch and a beach umbrella into a ballerina.
The artist has said in the past that creating the silhouette scenes is 'incredibly therapeutic, although at times it's equally tedious'.

The annual 'firefall' natural phenomenon at Yosemite National Park thrilled watchers who made it to the area this year despite nasty weather conditions.

The 'firefall' looks like a waterfall of bright orange lava spilling from a craggy mountainside, however it is an optical illusion. Once a year, for brief periods during a couple of weeks, the angle of the setting sun hits Horsetail Fall waterfall just right and causes it to look illuminated from within, as if the fall is made of molten lava.

The natural magic trick happens in Yosemite Valley around the second week of February, usually starting the 16th. This year, it started on the 12th, meaning those who made the trek to see it got an unusually small crowd of gawkers to contend with.

188625661189259_1443707859014360,"Boy or girl? It's a sloth, so we don't know yet

HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) - Zookeepers are waiting for a DNA test to learn whether #Hattiesburg Zoo's baby sloth is a boy or a girl. That's because sloths' sex organs are internal.
They'll have to send a bit of fur to a larger zoo to learn the gender of the Hoffman's two-toed sloth born to Mo and Chewy, curator of mammals Stephen Taylor said Friday.
Mama Mo, hanging upside-down with the baby resting on her belly, was on public view Friday for the first time since giving birth Feb. 5.

The first days after birth are delicate for any animal, and Taylor said this one didn't start suckling on its own. After about half a day, zookeepers began feeding it puppy milk replacement from a syringe fitted with a nipple instead of a needle, he said.
""We're still hoping it'll pick it up once it gets more coordinated and mobile,"" he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
Not that sloths, native to Central and South America, are wildly active at any time.
They were named for their inaction, an adaptation to their low-nutrition diet of leaves.
The baby's even slower than adults - and clumsy, Taylor said.
""It just sits on mom's tummy right now,"" he said.
About every two hours, a zookeeper disengages the baby to feed it.
Starting Friday, those feedings moved from behind the scenes to the sloths' viewing window.
Since it was a workday, there wasn't much of a crowd. ""I imagine tomorrow's going to be pretty nuts,"" Taylor said.
Because of the baby, Mo hasn't been part of the twice-weekly ""sloth experiences"" which let visitors pay extra to mix up sloth food and even hold Chewy, who used to be a pet, on their laps.
It's likely to be ""quite a few months"" before she and the baby return to the sloth experience room, Taylor said.
Although sloths are born with a full coat of fur, their eyes open, and a full complement of teeth and long claws, they're dependent on their mothers for about a year, according to the zoo.

Around 1,000 day-old tiny newly-hatched chicks have been cruelly abandoned in a field.
Several of the chicks had already died by the time they were discovered in a field in #Crowland, near #Peterborough, in Cambridgeshire by a member of the public on Friday.
RSPCA inspectors  who were called to the scene described seeing a 'sea of yellow' and being greeted by an 'unbelievable noise'.

This Sunday marks the 20th anniversary of the death of Chinese statesman #DengXiaoping.
Twenty years on, China continues to benefit from the late leader's wisdom and political legacy.
As the first Special Economic Zone in China, the city of Shenzhen has been transformed from a fishing village to China's gateway to the rest of the world, thanks to Deng Xiaoping's advocacy of reform and opening up.
Deng Xiaoping has been called ""the architect of China's reform and opening-up"" for his painstaking efforts in leading the country's modern-day transformation starting in the late 1970s.
Victor Gao, scholar, current affairs commentator, and a man who once worked as the interpreter of Deng Xiaoping, says his influence was far reaching.
""Deng Xiaoping saved the Chinese nation at the end of the 1970s, in my best judgement, Deng Xiaoping was the profit for the Chinese nation. And he charted the roadmap for the reform and opening up to the outside world, which even today, China is still in the shadow of his wisdom and foresight. Without Deng Xiaoping, at the end of the 1970s, China probably would not be able to break out from that huge ideological box, in which China was firmly locked up,"" he says.
Deng was recognized as the core of the second-generation leadership of the Communist Party of China.
While in office he pursued progressive measures that earned him respect from across the nation. By using pragmatic reforms, Deng came up with unique and innovative solutions.
""He has his particular way of looking at challenges, in a sense he is good at coming up with very unique and innovative solutions by avoiding being deadlocked in any particular situation. We know that his famous saying of it's not that important if the cat is black or white, and the most important thing is the cat catches mice,"" Gao says.
In June 1984, Deng Xiaoping formulated the concept of ""one country, two systems"", which later facilitated the peaceful settlement of the Hong Kong issue.
Under the concept, China was obliged to leave Hong Kong's economic status unchanged after the handover on July 1, 1997.
Even now, the policy has been important in framing the Taiwan issue.
""Despite many challenges and major changes in the political situation in Hong Kong, I think most of the people in Hong Kong as well as here in mainland still fully acknowledge the truthfulness and validity of the 'one country two systems' philosophy. Eventually, this great innovative concept may also be applied to Taiwan to resolve the return of Taiwan and the reunification of the motherland,"" Gao says.
Deng's far-sighted political wisdom has resulted in the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong today. His modernization plans have made China the world's second-largest economy.
These are seen as major milestones for the Chinese nation.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1443574789027667/?type=3,2017-02-18 22:27:00,2960,27,48,2925,21,2,10,1,1

PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Some joggers weren't joking when they said they were going out for a ""brief run.""
In briefs, boxers, bras and bloomers, they ran three-quarters of a mile in a Valentine's Day-related charity event benefiting sick children.
Saturday's annual Cupid's Undie Run featured 1,000 people in their underwear and little else, except for maybe some body-painted hearts, angels and Cupid's arrows on their chests. Participants, some of whom shaved hearts into their chest hair, ran through the streets near the city's sports stadiums.

Previous years' events have taken place despite snow, but weather for this year's was sunny with temperatures approaching 70 degrees, prompting runners in their scanty panties to chirp, ""Sun's out! Buns out!""
Sisters Melissa Tamimi, in gray panties and a matching sports bra, and Sofia Tamimi, in black panties and a gray lacy bra, had no problem mentioning their unmentionables.
""I'm about as comfortable as you could be running in underwear,"" Melissa Tamimi said.
Similar events took place in other cities, including St. Louis, Miami, Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Money was raised for the Children's Tumor Foundation to help research neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes tumors in the nervous system. The incurable disorder can cause physical deformities, blindness, deafness and chronic pain, usually in adolescents.
Runner Jeff Eckert, who's 30 years old, said he was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis, also called NF, when he was 5. He said he was participating in the Undie Run wearing Superman boxer shorts to help raise money and awareness.
Philadelphia race director Dan Frenia, whose wife and 12-year-old son have been diagnosed with NF, said this year's race raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and the national events have raised about $20 million over the last few years. He said he hoped to grow the Philadelphia event from 1,000 people to 3,000 or more and spread the word about NF so a cure can be found.
""This is our passion in life,"" he said. ""This isn't just a one-day event for us.""
Cupid's Undie Run is a fun run, not a race, organizers said, so there was no declared winner other than the Children's Tumor Foundation.
Friends Ellie Russo and Kendra Scherer ran among the 53 members of a team called Hope for Ella, which was named in honor of a 10-year-old girl with NF and raised the most money on Saturday, $26,810. They wore red bras and matching cheeky boy shorts with a message on the buttocks: ""I take my pants off for charity.""

A video captured the leopard showed that its bully was so bulged that it touched the ground when the animal walked. After comparison, researchers found that features of this leopard match exactly with the leopard spotted in 2014. He might have eaten too much so that he looked like pregnant.
 
According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, Amur leopard is so rare that it can be hardly spotted by people. Patrols and researchers in Heilongjiang were thrilled to find the wild ones in the nature reserve. In 2016 alone, they have captured wild Amur leopards on camera 17 times, and wild Amur tigers 5 times, suggesting that the numbers of these endangered animals probably are on the rise, thanks to the conservation work.","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1443303612388118/?type=3,2017-02-18 18:45:00,4166,16,66,4082,29,7,45,2,1

The Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor is suing over fake Terracotta Army on display in both Europe and #Anhui Province in east China. 

Replicas of Terracotta Warriors have been on display in a railway station in #Liege, #Belgium, since last December. There were reportedly no signs that explain to tourists that the poorly-made Terracotta Warriors were fake. Similarly, in a culture park in Anqing in east China's Anhui province, more than 1,000 replicas of Terracotta army were seen. It's reported that visitors are required to pay 120 yuan (US$17) each to see the statues. 

The Museum of the Mausoleum said in a statement that both places had violated its rights to use the name Terracotta Warriors and the museum reserved the right to pursue legal action. 

The mausoleum, now a #UNESCO World Heritage Site, was originally built in 208 BC to worship Emperor Qin who unified China in 221 BC.

There are calls by conservationists for #pangolin use in medicine to be banned, to help save the animal from extinction.

The call comes on World Pangolin Day, the third Saturday in February, and was made by the #China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, reports thepaper.cn.

The Foundation wants the State Council, the highest state administrative body in China, to issue a national plan on the protection of pangolins, which would strictly prohibit selling, eating, or using pangolins for medicinal reasons.

The foundation also suggests that pangolins should become a first class nationally protected animal instead of second class, as it is now.

The consumption of pangolins has caused a public outcry in China recently. Earlier this month, the screenshot of a microblog post about #Guangxi officials inviting investors from #HongKong to eat pangolin at a reception went viral on Sina Weibo. In another case, a young woman was arrested and placed under investigation in Shenzhen after pictures allegedly showing her eating pangolins were discovered online by local officials.

As things stand, medical use of pangolins is still lawful in China, although almost a decade ago, in November, 2007, the Chinese government said such treatment could only take place in stipulated hospitals and clinics.

The State forestry administration issues consumption control measures every year. Figures from 2008 to 2015 show the total consumption control measure was 186 tons, an annual average of 26.6 tons.

In the last ten years, at least 1 million pangolins have been hunted and traded worldwide to be eaten or for medical use, according to the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation. Pangolin scales are believed to have health benefits, and are used to make medicines, while pangolin flesh is considered a delicacy.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in #Asia and #Africa all eight pangolin species are vulnerable and the numbers are rapidly declining.","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1442980422420437/?type=3,2017-02-18 15:45:00,16617,41,641,16385,105,103,14,8,2

Downing Centre District Court in #Sydney, #Australia, has recently fined Nicholas Seafood, one of the most popular local fishmongers, A$1500 ($1,150 USD) for animal cruelty. One of its employees was seen torturing a lobster in 2016. This is the first case regarding crustaceans pursued by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (#RSPCA).  

A video filmed by passersby showed that after placing the thrashing lobster on the cutting board, the employee directly chopped off its tail without trying to stun it to minimize pain in a state of insensibility. It seemed that the lobster suffered at least half a minute before being put through a band saw when its head finally stopped moving.
 
Australian regulations including the New South #Wales 1979 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the Australian Capital Territory's 1992 Animal Welfare Act have prohibited cruelty by intentionally causing pain or failing to act. Since the protections are applicable to crustaceans for human consumption, the RSPCA argues that the employee's inhumane treatment of the lobster before eventual mechanical killing is illegal.","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1442328452485634/?type=3,2017-02-17 18:08:44,1176,18,17,1166,5,2,0,0,3

Independently developed by #CRRC Beijing Locomotive Co., Ltd.

With a payload capacity of 240 tons and 22ft (7 meters) in heights, this ""ultra class truck"" not only breaks the domestic records of the technologies in mining trucks manufacturing, but also has the potential to break the internationally renowned brands' monopoly within the industry.

According to reports, instead of using diesel fuel, as how traditional mining trucks would do, CR240E is the first to achieve the dual use of diesel and natural gas, thereby to reduce air pollution. It is estimated that this change will save fuel costs of about $220,000 (RMB1.5 million) and reduce #carbondioxide emissions by 60 tons every year.

Photos of South #Korea's Jeju International Airport with trash everywhere have drawn significant criticism since they were posted online on February 12, 2017. Many local netizens cast blame on Chinese tourists. However, a report from People's Daily says otherwise. 

Instead of pointing fingers at Chinese tourists, there are some reasonable explanations for the amount of packing paper and other rubbish at Jeju International Airport, the People's Daily said.

According to the report, the time crunch for boarding, the unreasonable layout of the airport lounge, and shopping and goods collection rules may contribute to passengers leaving trash.

A South Korean media outlet showed pictures of the departure lounge at Jeju International Airport with rubbish piled everywhere. It blamed Chinese passengers and tourists for littering -- mostly packaging from goods purchased -- throughout the airport.

Therefore, the blame is unfair. According to the airport's rules, passengers must complete all boarding procedures, including checking in, security inspection, collecting duty-free goods and boarding airplanes, within two hours, and each of these procedures may require them to queue and wait.

In addition, tourists can only take away Korean brand goods they buy in duty-free shops on Cheju Island after payment. However, duty-free goods with other international brands cannot be collected until passengers finish security inspection at the airport.

Many passengers have to remove packaging in the boarding area and stuff goods inside their suitcases before they run to the ferry buses and board the planes. If they do not hurry, passengers may miss their flights.

The airport did not provide enough dustbins for this discarded packaging, the paper said.

Jeju Island in South Korea is a hot destination for Chinese tourists. The People's Daily called for tourists to protect the environment and take away their rubbish. In addition, an improvement in infrastructure and high-quality public services are also important for the development of the tourism industry, it said.","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1442241372494342/?type=3,2017-02-17 17:02:45,1294,35,38,1261,8,17,6,2,0

The ratio of 48 companies per thousand people have reached the level of developed countries including Germany and Japan.   

Tan Manqing, director of the Administration of Industry and Commerce of Guangzhou Municipality, explained during the conference that the Administration had substantially simplified required registration procedures in advance for companies except for eleven categories including those in the field of finance. Most exempted companies could register with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) first to apply for business licenses before getting permission from supervision offices. Requirements of conditions for production and operations have also loosened.

188625661189259_1441547249230421,"#Tsinghua's lenient admissions requirements for foreigners spark public outcry

#China's Tsinghua University has been bombarded with criticism after it released a new set of admissions requirements for foreign applicants, which critics have deemed ""discriminatory against Chinese nationals.""

According to the university's 2017 requirements for international bachelor's degree applicants, foreign applicants must hold a high school diploma and pass the Level 5 HSK Chinese proficiency test with a score of at least 60 out of 100. All other entrance examinations are waived for foreign students.

The requirements have sparked controversy, with many denouncing the ""preferential policy,"" arguing that such requirements will dampen Chinese students' enthusiasm and lead to educational injustice.

""As one of China's most prestigious universities, Tsinghua's admissions requirements for international students are too lenient compared to those for their Chinese counterparts. At most respected universities in the U.K., there are specified enrollment standards for Chinese students requiring high GPAs and strong English skills,"" an expert from a Beijing-based study abroad agency told People's Daily Online.

The expert also believes that Tsinghua's Chinese proficiency requirement is too low compared to requirements for TOEFL or IELTS scores from Chinese applicants abroad, as foreigners can pass the Level 5 HSK exam by knowing only 2,500 Chinese words.

Other critics believe that the new requirements may worsen China's educational injustices. Many Chinese parents already give birth to their children abroad so that their offspring can obtain foreign passports. If those foreign passport-holders then seek to receive an education in China, they have much easier access to prestigious schools and education resources than their Chinese peers.

It makes sense that Tsinghua is seeking to recruit more international students, as a certain proportion of foreign students is a crucial criterion for all internationally-recognized universities. Currently, foreigners only account for 5.8 percent of Tsinghua students, which is lower than the 20 percent figure at universities such as Oxford and Harvard, Xiong Bingqi, vice president of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, told Thepaper.cn.

Though it is necessary to enroll more foreign students, Xiong pointed out that this should be done by improving the quality of education at Chinese universities, rather than by lowering admissions requirements.

Tsinghua University could not be reached for a comment as of press time. In an announcement published on Tsinghua's official website, Liu Zhen, director of Tsinghua's international admissions office, said the new requirements are not intended to lower standards for foreign applicants, but to evaluate applicants in more multi-dimensional way. http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0217/c90000-9179405.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1441547249230421/?type=3,2017-02-17 03:15:01,2347,15,22,2326,4,5,0,2,10

An urban management officer, also known as Chengguan, was seen holding up a sign that said sham right next to a pair of beggars in east China's Jiangsu on February 11, 2017.

One of the beggars was on his knee begging for money for his ""sick mother,"" who was lying beside him. And the Chengguan officer with the warning sign stood just ten feet away. The photos of the scene went viral online.

The Chengguan officer told reporters that the beggar, surnamed Fan, was a ""professional beggar"" who had been seen begging money on street, every time accompanied by an elderly.  And this time the elder woman was his mother-in-law. The officer also said that Fan was spotted using an iPhone, dressing in luxury brands and staying in a hotel.

Fan along with many of his family members see begging as a career. According to reports, they once traveled to Singapore to beg with more than ten thousand a day received, and were later repatriated.

Local Chengguan warned citizens to be aware of these fake beggars' sham, especially during holiday seasons, and be sure to call the police upon seeing minors begging on the street.

Most dogs will do almost anything for a treat. 
But this Australian Shepherd dog has the patience of a saint when it comes to getting a goody from his owner. 
This is Oshie, a clever pooch who can balance treats on his nose and head and wait for his owner to tell him when to tuck in.

In this adorable video, Oshie is sat on a porch outside with treats on his feet, in his mouth and on his nose.
His owner, Sara Tuxbury, keeps piling the treats on top of him in a jenga style, but he doesn't flinch.
Then as the treats stack up, Oshie is given the nod that he can have them.

The excited three-year-old pooch shakes his head to get all the treats onto the ground and then starts to gobble them up.
According to an instagram account, Oshie is an ice cream obsessed, adventure pup, currently in Okinawa, Japan.
The video has been watched more than 222,000 times on YouTube.

An online footage showing a staff member of a zoo in southwest China's Guizhou dragging a tiger's tail has prompted the zoo to launch an investigation on his potential abusive conduct.

The footage, streamed and posted by an animal trainer of the Guiyang Forest Wild Animal Zoo, has gone viral since February 15, 2017. It shows the trainer forcibly dragged the tiger's tail while the cat tried to get away. The footage also showed that the trainer rode on the tiger's back and pulled its ears.

The video has infuriated many netizens; many of whom complained of the trainer's abusive behavior. This scandalous live streaming was spotted by a netizen first, who later found more videos of tigers being teased uploaded by this trainer since December 2016. The trainer later told reporters in an interview that the park did not oppose such conduct and claimed that he would continue shooting similar videos every day. In response to the video, the zoo's official has launched an investigation to examine whether the trainer's conduct was considered as abusive.

What is the Chinese dream? At one level, it is the dream of nation to become prosperous and great, a great dream of national rejuvenation. On a personal level, however, it is the dream of each and every Chinese to achieve personal success and prosperity.

A photo in China has captured a moment in the Chinese dream.

Each year, World Press Photo rewards amazing photographers for their contributions to the past year of visual journalism. This year, a photo titled ""Sweat Makes Champions"" by Chinese photographer Tiejun Wang won second prize in the Daily Life single pictures category of the contest.

The image ""Sweat Makes Champions"" is a single picture documenting an ordinary element in everyday life in China. The black-and-white image features four young gymnastic students at a school in Xuzhou, China, doing toe-pressure training for 30 minutes in the afternoon.

The photographer's success, the ordinary yet interesting subjects of his picture, and the realistic title of the photograph all capture parts of the Chinese dream in action.

The dream of every photographer, such as Chinese photographer Tiejun Wang, is to capture great images that are cherished forever. The dream of every student, such as the four young gymnasts, is to aspire for greatness.

But greatness requires sacrifice and hard work.

The photographer and his subjects are symbols of how the Chinese dream is realized through hard work.

When Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered his speech in Davos at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2017, he said China's outstanding development achievements over the past decades ""owe themselves to the hard work and perseverance of the Chinese people, a quality that has defined the Chinese nation for several thousand years.""

In his New Year speech in Beijing on December 31, 2016, President Xi said that ""only hard work will make dreams come true."" Using a popular Chinese catchphrase, Xi said, ""Roll up your sleeves and get to work!""

In other words, sweat makes champions, and what we are witnessing today in China and on the world stage is the hard work of China's champions. http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0215/c90000-9178306.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1439277319457414/?type=3,2017-02-15 04:37:01,2648,74,80,2471,30,12,4,116,15

The plant was set up in Sansha City, a prefecture level city formed in 2012 to administer a number of islands and atolls in the South China Sea. Processed water used to be scarce there. Local fishermen recalled that the water was not even sufficient to supply daily routine including drinking, cooking, showering or washing clothes before the plant was introduced.
 
The plant, which is supported by solar power and wind power, is capable of treating 1,000 tonnes of seawater per day and 700 tonnes of processed water is directly drinkable. The electricity generated from the plant's solar panels are also used for lighting during the night time, and the sewage is treated before reused on the trees and flowers. A complete recycling system is introduced to the islands in Sansha city together with the desalination plant.

China's second aircraft carrier is scheduled to be launched later this year and is expected to enter the service by 2020, Xu Guangyu, a retired Chinese military officer and consultant to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Assn, said in an interview with Beijing Media Network.

China's first home-made aircraft carrier, designed to be a base for fighter jets and helicopters, is now near completion. The aircraft carrier is the first of the Type 001A class, and represents an important step in advancing China's naval power.

""The aircraft carrier is being built as planned. Most of its major construction and design work has been completed. Its hull has already been assembled in a shipyard. The ship will soon be equipped with aviation, radar and other facilities,"" said Chinese Defense Ministry Spokesperson Wu Qian in October 2016, when he was responding to media inquiries on alleged aircraft carrier images circulating online.

Yin Zhuo, a Chinese naval expert, also confirmed in a CCTV interview that China's first home-made aircraft carrier is expected to be launched in water in early 2017.

There is still a large amount of work to do at the carrier's outfitting stage after its launching. It will take about one to two years to carry out functional debugging for its devices as well as weapons and equipment. The new aircraft carrier could begin its sea trial by early 2019, Xu said. 

Xu also mentioned in the interview that Chinese carrier pilots are also under training, with an expectation of forming two aviation units.

Meanwhile seals off the Lincolnshire coast and owls in Berkshire prove there are plenty of affectionate animals closer to home. And a pair of snails showed love comes in all shapes and sizes.
However others appeared to be less lucky in love. A zebra was snapped as it tried to turn away from its amorous mate while a desperate flamingo did all it could to woo the object of its desire.
Here, FEMAIL shares some of the most touching moments captured in the love-struck animal kingdom.

188625661189259_1438103169574829,"Young lady got her face scraped after beated but local police refused to help: Tourism chaos in Yunnan Province

Yunnan has always been an ideal holiday destination in China, famous for its perfect combination of amazing natural scenery, diverse ethnic customs, and pleasant climate all year round. However, negative news has haunted tourism in Yunnan in recent years.

The media exposure of the woman hospitalized, face scraped has brought the conflict in Yunnan tourism to the public attention again.
A Weibo blogger posted pictures of herself early 2017, claiming that she was beaten up by a dozen of men while eating barbecue in Lijiang city, Yunnan province and that local police refused to investigate the case.

The incident happened around 3:30 am on November 11, 2016, in a barbecue restaurant in Lijiang. According to the woman's post, twelve men beated her and her friends. They ""dragged me out by my hair and kept beating me[...] After the beating, they scraped my face with a broken bottle, and threatened to kill me if they saw me in Lijiang again.""

Local police refused to investigate the case, instead, they let her take a body examination in hospital after 90 days on February 11. The woman felt helpless and thus posted the incident out on Weibo.

From tour guides being abusive and forcing tourists to make purchases to tourists bullied and hospitalized, not only do people worry about the quality of their holiday experience but also their belongings and even personal safety are threatened.

The governor of Yunnan Province has concluded that problems persist due to the poor management of the tourism industry in Yunnan. In the past, conflicts and events were reported and handled individually but the right approach to prevent problems from happening would be to execute severe punishments and to clarify responsibilities of local governments.

Besides poor management, various interest groups have been profiting from gray areas. For example, the traditional free tours in Yunnan have been prevailing and profitable, and it is the collusion parties such as the tour companies, local business administration departments, and even local police that made the business model possible.

The same parties would be resistant to the new regulations and improved management and thus a blacklist mechanism is necessary to prohibit them from participating in the business in the future.

Chinese students at Columbia University, in New York, have had an unusual response after non-Western name tags were ripped from dorm room doors during the Chinese Lunar New Year. In a campaign later joined by other international students, the Chinese students attempted to explain to the English-speaking community the meaning carried by different characters in their names in a video entitled ""Say my name"".

In the video, students introduce their names, explain the origin of their name, its meaning in Chinese, and why the names are important to them.

Students say the names are part of the Chinese culture and contain their parents' wishes and expectations for them, which they take seriously. That's why the incident incited outrages among the Chinese and the East Asian students' community.

It's often the practice for Chinese students in English-speaking societies to have a Western name so as to make conversations with locals easier, as the Chinese names can sometimes be hard to pronounce.

The university's Office of Multicultural Affairs said they had received students' reports and have launched an investigation to determine whether the incident was racially biased, as the vandalism came in the week following an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump that heavily restricted immigration to the United States.

The Asian American Alliance has also released a statement in which they condemned the vandalism, describing the acts as ""xenophobic efforts to divide and incite fear among Columbia's Asian and Asian American community.""

Several other groups of students at the University have also spoken out against the incidents taking place. The groups have banded together to release a joint statement regarding the matter.

The world's fattest woman has been safely transported to India for life-saving surgery after being craned out of her home in Egypt. 

Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, 36, who weighs 78 stone (some 500 kg), was taken out of her home in Alexandria and placed in an Egypt Air cargo plane earlier today.

A wall of her room had to be brought down to help bring her out.
Ms Aty, who suffers from a condition called Elephantiasis, will now have weight reduction surgery at Saifee Hospital in Mumbai, western India.

Prior to this journey, she had not left her home for 25 years as she was unable to move from her bed.

After a seven-hour flight, she was placed in a mini truck at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and transported to hospital, where she will undergo a series of Bariatric procedures. 

The surgery is a stomach-shrinking bypass procedure carried out on those wanting to lose excessive weight.

Eman was born weighing a staggering 11lbs and was shortly diagnosed afterwards with the parasitic disease.

By the time she turned 11, she was too heavy to support her weight standing up, and resorted to crawling in her home on her knees.

Around the same time she dropped out of primary school and tragically suffering a cerebral stroke, which left her bedridden and exacerbated her conditions, causing her to remain in her room.

She has suffered paralysis in right leg and right arm.

Xu Lanfang, a 66-year-old woman living in the Yinzhou district of Ningbo, Zhejiang province, recently repaid a number of loans that she took out for her husband's medical care 15 years ago. The loans were recorded in an account book that only Xu was able to make sense of, provoking many people to praise her integrity. 

The account book contains only un-annotated numbers, as Xu never learned how to read or write Chinese characters. Instead, she memorized the names of her lenders and matched each number to a name. 

Xu's husband was diagnosed with uremia when she was just 26, making life even harder for the already struggling family. With help from her family, friends, the government and fellow villagers, Xu's husband was able to live 13 years past his diagnosis. After his death, in order to repay the many small loans, Xu examined her log every night so she wouldn't forget a single name or number.

With her economic situation improving in recent years, Xu was finally able to walk door to door and repay each villager.

On the 15th day of #ChineseNewYear, traditional lanterns end up lighting up the entire country in a halo of light.

When it comes to this traditional festival, which takes place this Saturday, a tranquil city in Southwest #China's Sichuan Province has a lot to offer.

Located about 200 kilometers southeast from the provincial capital city Chengdu, Zigong may not attract the same amount of international attention as some other Sichuan cities, but when it comes to lanterns, Zigong - a city that also made its name for salt well drilling and paleontological discoveries - overshadows all others.

While it takes about three hours to get to Zigong from Chengdu by bus, you will definitely feel it was worth the trip as you enter the city through an expressway decorated on either side with trees covered in strings of either white or purple lights.

City of light

Flickering reflections of lights shining on buildings can be seen in the city's Fuxi River. All these beams of light originate at Caideng, or Multi-colored Lantern, Park, in the center of the city.

Among many other lantern shows throughout China, Zigong's annual lantern gala was recognized as a part of the country's national intangible heritage in 2008.

In the early editions of the lantern show, residents in the city sometimes had to endure blackouts during the Spring Festival to save some electricity for the power-hungry event.

However, with the increased use of energy-saving light bulbs at the festival in recent years, the people of Zigong have been able to enjoy more complex-designed lanterns without needing to fear their power will be cut.

From traditional paper lanterns to more avant-garde lanterns made from empty vials, glass bottles and china ware, the show depicts the diverse legends of Chinese history with various colored lights.

Zigong's lantern show can trace it's origins all the way back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The city started to hold a more modern lantern gala around the Spring Festival in 1987, and it attracts thousands of visitors in every edition of the show.

Figures released on February 3 by the organizing committee of this year's lantern gala reveals that more than 600,000 people visited the park since the show opened on January 19.

It costs 100 yuan ($14.5) to enter the park during the Spring Festival holiday, but after the Lantern Festivaladmission fees drop to 60 yuan for Fridays and Saturdays and 40 yuan on other days.

Zigong is renowned for its Jurassic dinosaur fossils, thus some articulated dinosaur-like lanterns are often seen at the festival.

Additionally, there will always be a major lantern section dedicated to that year's Chinese zodiac animal.

As 2017 is the Year of the Rooster, a lantern of a phoenix - one Chinese legend tells the tale of a phoenix who evolved from a rooster - perches on a some 10-meter-high phoenix tree lantern located in the park's central pond. A bridge crossing the pond is also covered with a rooster-like ceiling. http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0211/c90000-9176693.html","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1435527493165730/?type=3,2017-02-10 22:30:00,5293,17,114,5222,37,30,3,0,1

Cherishing the dream of becoming luminaries in the art world, tens of thousands of Chinese students recently sat for the art school entrance exam, which was held nationwide in February. The exam, infamous for its intense competition, has once again attracted attention to #China's unique art education system.

On Feb. 8, Beijing Film Academy (BFA) and the Central Academy of Drama (CADCA), two of China's top-flight art schools, simultaneously kicked off this year's exam. Over 36,000 applicants for CADCA will vie for 577 vacancies, while more than 38,000 candidates will compete for 499 positions at BFA. Both schools have seen an unprecedented rise in their number of applicants this year, the Xinhua News Agency reported.

The exam, also known as ""yikao,"" is usually held in February or March. Students who want to study design, art, drama, theater or film have to take the test before the National Entrance Exam held in June. Art schools also have the power to hold their own more specialized tests.

A shortcut to fame

""I have been preparing for the exam ever since I was a kid. Though the exam is highly competitive, I still want to give it a try,"" said Zhang Cheng (pseudonym), a 19-year-old female exam candidate from Zhengzhou, Henan province.

Zhang is far from the only young person with this dream. Due to China's booming entertainment industry, more and more Chinese students are choosing art school, hoping that a high-quality education can pave the road to fame and success.

Indeed, the exam not only attracts ordinary applicants, but also several young stars who have already received some recognition. Wang Junkai, a 17-year-old pop singer, took part in this year's exam. Under the hashtag ""GoodLuckWangJunKai,"" over 3.5 million fans sent good wishes to their idol via Sina Weibo. The page had garnered over 380 million views as of press time.

In response to the tough competition, a representative from CADCA explained to Xinhua that drama-related majors are being increasingly embraced by applicants and their parents, due to the focus on theater education in elementary and middle schools. Thanks to these early programs, many now believe the path offers a promising future.

But not every applicant is able to enjoy an illustrious education. Among 6,148 candidates who have applied to earn a BFA in drama and film performance in 2017, only 25 will be enrolled, yielding an admission rate of only 0.3 percent. In Jiangsu province alone, the number of applicants has surpassed 8,000, one applicant's mother told People's Daily.

""Though the chances of being admitted are quite slim, I still want to try. If I can win [a spot], I will have a bright future ahead of me,"" said Zhang.

Controversial art education

The furor surrounding the exam has drawn criticism from the public and the media, with some saying that many applicants only dream of wealth and fame--and have no real interest in art.

An online search for ""yikao"" yields dozens of negative articles, with many touching on corruption and sexual harassment in the application process. The exam has also birthed a booming yet unregulated training course industry in China, imposing extra economic burden on applicants who feel they must pay for extra classes to stand any real chance.

Authorities have also taken note of the issue, with the Ministry of Education raising the minimum score required for admission in 2014. The ministry canceled some individual exams as well, but such moves do little to dampen applicants' enthusiasm.

""'Artist' is no different from any other occupation. The public should shift its focus from wealthy stars to the quality of art education and art in China, without over-hyping the exam,"" said an expert from the Beijing File Association. http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0210/c90000-9176585.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1435500689835077/?type=3,2017-02-10 20:26:07,9186,54,66,9092,56,26,9,0,3

An 80 year-old Chinese veteran, who has been trapped in India for half a century, is setting off on his long-awaited return home today, China Central Television reports.

Wang Qi has finally received an Indian passport from India's Ministry of External Affairs allowing him to leave the country. He and his son plan to fly to #China on Friday.

Wang says he is most looking forward to eating some of the specialty hand-made noodles from his village in Shaanxi province.

Wang said that he joined the Chinese People's Liberation army in 1960 and was dispatched to the border with India in 1960 during the Sino-India war. He got lost in December of that year in a forest near his camp and was then taken to India by an Indian Red Cross Vehicle.

He was later handed over to the Indian army and spent seven years in prison. After being released, Wang was sent to a remote village named Tirodi in India's central state of Madhya Pradesh and started a life there. He married a local woman and the couple raised four children.

The veteran had repeatedly applied to the Indian government to go back to China over the last few decades but he had been denied official Indian documents and citizenship time and again.

He said he feels sorry for failing to make it to China when his mother passed away years ago.

His story was reported by media last month and instantly triggered calls for him to be repatriated.

China's embassy in India says it has pushed India to complete entry and exit procedures in time. Ambassador Luo Zhaohui talked to Wang over the phone on Saturday, telling Wang that the embassy has maintained close contact with the Indian government over the issue of facilitating his trip to China to visit family members. The embassy issued a 10-year Chinese passport to Wang in 2013, and since then has been providing him financial support.

In a report by Shaanxi-based Chinese Business View, a local official from Wang's hometown said the local government heard of Wang's plight years ago and decided to treat him equally with other villagers and give him a piece of residential land if he wanted to spend his later years at home.

According to Wang, there is another Chinese veteran in Tirodi named Liu Shurong. Originally from China's Chongqing municipality, Liu also got married to a local woman and has four children. However, Liu decided not to come back to China since he had gotten used to the life in India and has no relatives left in China.

More than 10 wild elephants recently invaded a village in Mengla County in southwestern #China's Yunnan province, according to the local forestry police on Feb. 10. There were no reports of injuries or casualties, as authorities came quickly to the rescue.

The incident occurred while thousands of villagers were gathered to celebrate the Gatangpa Festival, a major festival for the Hani ethnic minority. The elephants trampled several chickens and geese, walked along the highway and ate some of the village's crops. Police said the elephants stood nearby, wandering the fields and farmland in search of food after the sun set.

During the incident, over 100 mu, or 6.66 hectares of bananas, were eaten by the hungry elephants. A significant portion of farmland was also destroyed by the elephants' heavy footsteps.

Hundreds of whales stranded on a remote beach in New Zealand's South Island have died, while rescuers are working to refloat more than hundred more.

Whale rescue organisation Project Jonah said in a Facebook post that there were 416 pilot whales stranded on Farewell Spit, and that 75 per cent had died overnight. 

'Efforts this morning will be focused on refloating the remaining live whales at high tide,' the organisation wrote on Friday.

Together with the Department of Conservation, Project Jonah was calling helpers to the northern end of Golden Bay on the island's west coast to help refloat the surviving whales.

A team of up to 30 trained whale medics were headed to the stranding. Volunteers from around the country also scrambled to get to the beach 90 kilometres south west of Nelson.

It is the biggest whale stranding in New Zealand in recent times.

A police investigation is underway into the theft of black swan eggs at a scenic spot over Spring Festival, which has left the swan pair grief-stricken and unable to eat.

The eggs were taken from the breeding pair at the swan scenic spot of Mount Tai, east China's Shandong province.

Staff members have reviewed security camera footage and said that two tourists may have been responsible for the theft.

Li Yaming, general manager of the swan breeding company in Taian city, told reporters that the swan eggs went missing on February 1. Keepers found that the black swan couple had left their nest, were making a lot of noise, and were being aggressive towards people coming too near to them.

""The two black swans were behaving very abnormally, and then the breeder found out that the five black swan eggs were all gone,"" said Li Yaming.

Swans tend to stay in the nest during the incubation period. In general, male swans keep guard while female swans incubate the eggs. The thieves would have needed to wait for the swan couple to take a break before taking the eggs, said Li.

According to the staff at the scenic spot, unhatched eggs are useless to ordinary people. The eggs can't be eaten nor can they be hatched. Also, the eggs could explode in hot weather. But even if they were returned by the thieves, the five missing eggs can no longer be hatched.

Swans are nationally protected animals, and as they are strictly monogamous, they are seen as a symbol of loyalty in love.

Incubating eggs for swans is a painful process. Female swans only produce 4-7 eggs every spring, and the time needed for the eggs to incubate is 36 days. Even with great care by swan couples, the survival rate of eggs is only 50 percent.

When the military advanced into Mosul, Nour Park, which had been home to a range of animals from monkeys to horses, was transformed into an Islamic State staging ground for attacks on Iraqi troops.

Neighbors had been feeding the animals, but when the fighting became too fierce, they could not leave their homes. Some of the animals starved to death. Others escaped or were killed in the fighting.

Anti-ISIS group Mosul Eye uploaded the pictures in a desperate plea for help from animal charities. They later revealed that the lioness had died.

Tian is on the hunt for a black iPhone 6, on which are saved more than 1,000 photos and videos of his late baby daughter, who died of leukemia just two days ago. Tian used the phone for two years, and acknowledges that it isn't worth much money now. However, Tian is nevertheless offering a reward of 2,000 RMB to help get it back, as he wants to hold on to his daughter's precious memory.
Tian's daughter was only 8 months old when she died. The baby was diagnosed with leukemia four months after her birth. She could only be treated with traditional Chinese medicine rather than chemotherapy due to her young age.
On Feb. 5, Tian found his daughter in bad condition at home in #Huanggang, #Hubei province. He drove her two hours to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. His wife recorded videos of their daughter as they got out of the car. According to Tian, his wife regularly took photos and videos of their daughter in order to capture each of her smiles and gestures.

Tian's wife took out the phone for the last time at about 2:40 PM on Feb. 5. Their daughter was emergently sent to the ICU, giving them no time to take out the cellphone. The baby passed away at 8:50 that evening.
Tian and his wife searched everywhere in vain for the lost phone. They discovered that the phone had been powered off when they tried calling it with another phone.
""The photos and videos on the phone are very important to us,"" said Tian. He hopes that the person who found the phone can understand their tender feelings.

The company further said that people will die in seconds when exposed to such high levels of radiation.

""The Chinese side has been watching closely the repercussions of the Fukushima nuclear leakage accident and has been asking the Japanese government to properly handle the accident and follow-up matters in a timely fashion,"" Lu said.

Lu further said added any responsible government will pay continuous and high attention to the impact of the nuclear leakage on the marine environment, food safety and people's health.  ""This is their obligation to not only the Japanese people, but also people from the rest of the world, its neighbours included.""

Chinese leaders in Beijing are taking big steps to tackle climate change and pollution, and some of China's cities are acting too.

Nanjing, the capital of China's eastern Jiangsu province, is getting a Vertical Forest, a set of two green residential towers that will beautify the city and will provide residents and visitors with a breath of fresh air. Nanjing, like many major cities in China, is looking for innovative ways to deal with air pollution.

The brain behind the concept is Stefano Boeri Architetti, an architect based in Milan, Italy. The first example of the Vertical Forest was realized in Milan in 2014. The two residential towers host 900 trees and over 20,000 plants from a wide range of shrubs and floral plants. On flat land, each vertical forest equals an area of 7,000 square meters of forest area.

Now, Stefano is bringing his innovative model for a sustainable residential building to Nanjing, a major city in China built along the Yangtze River. It will be the first Vertical Forest built in Asia.

According to the architect's website, Nanjing Green Towers will host a total of 1,100 trees from 23 local species and 2,500 cascading plants and shrubs and plants. The two green residential towers will provide 25 tons of CO2 absorption each year and will produce around 132 pounds of oxygen each day. The project is slated for completion in 2018.

The green residential towers aid in the absorption of CO2 and dust particles and produce oxygen. Other Chinese megacities, like Chongqing and Shanghai, are reportedly planning to build similar green structures.

China is disappointed about the high tax rates that the US government imposed on Chinese steel products and questioned the ""unfair ways"" in which the US conducts anti-dumping investigations, a Chinese official said over the weekend.

The comment came after the US Commerce Department on Thursday announced anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports, which range from 63.86 percent to 76.64 percent and countervailing duties from 75.6 percent to 190.71 percent.

The US has violated WTO rules by neglecting evidence from Chinese companies and has treated them unfairly on the excuse that the firms are State-owned enterprises, Wang Hejun, head of the Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau at China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), said in a statement posted on the ministry's website on Saturday.

In the anti-dumping investigation, US departments disregarded the active cooperation of the Chinese government and Chinese enterprises, Wang said.

""The Chinese government will take necessary measures to protect the rights of its enterprises,"" Wang noted.

The sluggish world economy and weak demand are the major factors behind the troubles in the domestic steel industry, Wang said, noting that joint efforts across the globe are needed to address the challenges in the industry.

""Protectionism harms other countries' rights to export products and injures the interests of US consumers and downstream industries,"" he said.

The Chinese government will urge the US to comply with WTO rules and correct its wrongful practices, the official said.","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1430009470384199/?type=3,2017-02-05 17:19:34,2291,13,48,2257,10,18,1,1,4

Over the next five-year period (2016-2020), China will continue to expand its PV capabilities and phase out outdated capacity, according to the NEA solar power development plan for the period.

China will add over 110 million kilowatts of solar power by 2020, according to the plan, and reduce the price of PV power by at least 50 percent compared with 2015.

The embassy said that they are sympathetic about his suffering and continue to offer him help, adding that with the joint efforts of China and India, the case will surely be resolved in an ideal manner and with respect to the individual concerned.

On Feb. 3, embassy staff told a local newspaper in Shaanxi that they are currently coordinating some issues concerning his case.

On the same day, the Special Care Pension for Wartime Veterans Office of Shaanxi's Civil Affairs Department announced that a deal was reached and the office will offer as much help as it can to Mr. Wang. Later that day, the Civil Affairs Department of Xianyang in Wang's hometown made a similar pledge.

The Japanese embassy in London has been paying £10,000 (US$12,500) per month to a British think tank to push anti-China campaign, the Times reported.

The Henry Jackson Society (HJS), a registered charity founded in 2005, has received money from the Japanese embassy in London for months. In return, the HJS campaigns against the growing co-operation between China and Britain, according to the Times' report published on January 29th, 2017.

HJS is said to encourage politicians and journalists to speak against Chinese foreign policy in British media, including former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.

Last weekend, Rifkind acknowledged to the Times that the HJS had approached him to put his name to an article, headlined ""How China could switch off Britain's lights in a crisis if we let them build Hinkley C,"" which questioned China's involvement in Britain's new nuclear plant.

The opinion piece, published last August by the Daily Telegraph, raised fear that ""no one knows what 'backdoor' technologies might be able to be introduced into the building of a power plant.""

Rifkind told the Times that he didn't know about the HJS' deal with the Japanese embassy, and said that the HJS ""ought to have informed me of that relationship when they asked me to support the article they provided.""

The Times' investigation revealed that the financial relationship between the HJS and the Japanese embassy began last year, and would be up for renewal in April.

A man planning to ride nearly 2,000 kilometers back home for the upcoming Spring Festival ended up much further away than when he started after spending more than one month riding in the opposite direction, Anhuinews.com reported.

The man only realised his mistake when he was pulled over by traffic police in Wuhu city, East China's Anhui province on the expressway last Friday.

Asked what he was doing, the man told them he was heading home to Qiqihaer city, Northeast China's Heilongjiang province by bike, only to be informed by traffic police he was going the wrong way.

The man began his journey in December from Rizhao city, East China's Shandong province.

Knowing that he was in Wuhu, a city lying more than 500 kilometers south of Rizhao, the man said he must have been given the wrong directions from passersby.

The poor man is reportedly a casual laborer with few earnings and spent lots of time surfing the internet at internet cafes, which left him no money.

Thinking his hopes of making it home in time for lunar New Year's Eve were over, traffic police and staff at the toll station chipped in to buy him a ticket home. http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0125/c90000-9171637.html","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1416689061716240/?type=3,2017-01-25 10:00:56,1075,11,10,1059,3,8,5,0,0

Beijing has deployed advanced Dongfeng-41 ICBMs in northernmost China's Heilongjiang Province, which borders Russia, according to reports based on images.

Some Hong Kong and Taiwan media reported that pictures of China's Dongfeng-41 ballistic missile were exposed on Chinese mainland websites. It was revealed that the pictures were taken in Heilongjiang Province. Military analysts believe that this is perhaps the second Dongfeng-41 strategic missile brigade and it should be deployed in northeastern China.

According to reports, the Dongfeng-41 is a nuclear solid-fuel road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile. With a range of 14,000km and a payload of 10-12 nuclear warheads, it can target anywhere in the world and is widely considered one of the most advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles.

There has been constant speculation about the Dongfeng-41. Its deployment is classified at the highest military levels. But most military experts believe that China has finished the research and production of the Dongfeng-41 and the conditions for deployment are optimal. But there has been no authoritative information on whether China has a Dongfeng-41 strategic missile brigade, how many such brigades it has and where they are deployed.

Some media claimed that the Chinese military intentionally revealed the Dongfeng-41 and connected it with the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. They think this is Beijing's response to Trump's provocative remarks on China.

According to RIA Novosti, the alleged deployment of the DF-41 near Russia's border should not be read as a threat to Russia, confirmed by military analyst Konstantin Sivkov.

""DF-41 missiles placed near Russia's border are a smaller threat than if they were placed deeper in the Chinese territory. Such missiles usually have a very large 'dead zone' [area within minimal range that cannot be attacked by a weapon],"" he said, adding that the ICBMs would not be able to target Russia's Far East and most of Eastern Siberia from the Heilongjiang Province.

""Certainly, the actions of the Chinese military, if the reports prove correct, the military build-up in China is not perceived as a threat to our country,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The Kremlin agreed with the assessment, saying that China is Russia's ""strategic partner in political and economic senses.""

China plans to build a next-generation synchrotron radiation facility in Beijing, according to a researcher from Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the country's top research institutes.

Dong Yuhui, the researcher, said that the project is expected to start construction in Nov next year and will be completed within six years. The total investment will reach 4.8 billion yuan (698.4 million USD).

The facility, dubbed Beijing Light Source, will meet the national security demands and create aerospace materials among other products. It will provide high-resolution method to know substantial structures better.

Beijing Light Source will be the so-called fourth generation light source, and its key performance indicators would be higher than the third-generation ones.

It will create the brightest X-rays in the world, 70 times brighter than the US National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) and 10 times brighter than Sweden's MAX IV, the strongest of its kind in the world so far.

Bright X-rays could help measure the atomic structure of various substances, and the higher brightness will help people to see more details of substances, something akin to using flashlight to see things, Dong said.

Currently, China has the light sources from first generation to third generation, such as the first-generation facility BSRF in Beijing, the second-generation facility NHLS in Hefei, Anhui province, and the third-generation SSRF in Shanghai.

188625661189259_1413763865342093,"""We are world famous now,"" Japanese right-wing hotelier gloated & refused to remove books denying Nanjing Massacre

A Japanese hotelier's denial of the 1937 massacre by Japanese troops in the Chinese city of Nanjing has prompted a rebuke from the Chinese Foreign Ministry as well as a boycott from Chinese social media. 

In December 1937 Japanese troops invaded Chinese eastern city of Nanjing and massacred over 300,000 Chinese people. 

Toshio Montoya, the APA hotel group CEO who is also the writer of the books, spoke on January 19 during a meeting at a right-wing gathering event. ""We are world famous now,"" Montoya gloated in front of the camera, ""lots of my friends said I've become a huge deal in news all across the United States, the Philippines, Hawaii and New York."" 

""After this event, we received more than ten thousand letters across Japan to encourage us. Loads of parliament members also called me to show their support. Because of the expectation of these people, I will not withdraw the book despite the criticism,"" said Montoya, after boasting about his ""news fame"".

The presence of these books in APA Hotels was revealed on January 12 on Chinese microblogging site Weibo by a user codenamed ""Katandsid"". According to the video posted by ""Katandsid"", the book openly denies the Nanjing Massacre in China and the forced prostitution in China and Korea by the Japanese troops during the World War II. The book also claims the historical evidence ""was fabricated by the Chinese side and did not actually happen.""

On January 17, the APA Group announced on their official website that they did not intend to withdraw the books from their guest rooms. On January 18, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo that the Japanese government believed it was important ""not to overly focus on the unfortunate past but for Japan and China to tackle issues currently facing the international community.""

China's foreign ministry has said Motoya's book ""once again shows that some forces in Japan are still reluctant to look squarely at history, and even try to deny and distort history"".

A parking lot attendant knelt before a red vehicle in #Hangzhou, east #China's #Zhejiang province, after the driver refused to pay the $6 (RMB40) parking fees on Jan 15, 2017. The attendant, last name Wu, said he had no choice but to kneel in front of the car to prevent it from driving away.   

The 30-year-old female drive of the red vehicle claimed that she would pay for the parking fee later via her mobile phone. However, Wu said she couldn't pay it that way. He said that many people had claimed that they would pay for the parking fee later on their phone, but they actually just escaped the fees. Therefore, parking lot attendants usually ask the drivers to pay the parking fee on scene before leaving the lot.   

With Wu blocking her way, the driver decided to park her car in the lot again. Wu warned her that if she continued to park the car in the parking lot, the fee would only accumulate. The car was found driven away on the next morning, generating a total of $9.7 (RMB67) parking fees. And to this date, it is reported that the driver still has not paid the fee. 

Some people might believe that the driver had successfully escaped the parking fee.

The red smog alert was issued by General Office of the People's Government of Beijing Municipality, while the orange smog alert was issued by China Meteorological Administration.

The new unanimous system on smog alerts will help solve the problem of different organizations following different smog alert standards.

For the time being, according to the General Office of the People's Government of Beijing Municipality, Beijing has its four-tier alert system for air pollution, with red being the highest level of alert, followed by orange, yellow and blue.

When a red alert is issued, it means the Air Quality Index will exceed 200 for over 72 hours. In that case, outdoor construction will be limited, the use of cars will be limited and schools are recommended to have students study at home.

China is willing to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, Chinese President #XiJinping said Tuesday.

Xi made the remarks when meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.

""We sincerely hope that Ukraine will maintain social stability and economic development,"" Xi said.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Ukraine.

Xi said China attaches great importance to relations with Ukraine and is ready to work with Ukraine to cement mutual political trust, strengthen exchanges between governments, legislatures and political parties, and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation.

He also suggested that the two nations enhance exchanges and cooperation in such areas as education, culture, health, sports and tourism, and beef up dialogue and coordination in international and regional affairs as well as multilateral institutions like the United Nations.

For his part, Poroshenko said Ukraine-China relations are very important.

Ukraine will make concerted efforts with China to expand their political, economic and trade cooperation, he said.

There exists great potential in bilateral cooperation in such areas as logistics, ports, agriculture, steel and machine manufacturing, he said, welcoming more Chinese investments in Ukraine.

Ukraine, one of the non-permanent UN Security Council members, will assume the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for February, according to Poroshenko.

He said Ukraine is willing to increase communication and coordination with China in the world body.

Poroshenko also extended his greetings to Xi and the Chinese people for the upcoming Spring Festival, or the Chinese Lunar New Year.

Xi and Poroshenko held their meeting ahead of the opening session of the 47th World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

The crisis in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014, when Kiev launched offensives against insurgents in a bid to retake the cities and towns they seized.

The Minsk agreement, signed in February 2015 in the Belarusian capital with the mediation of France and Germany, calls for a cease-fire along with a range of political, economic and social measures aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

One Golden Retriever has proved why dogs are really a man's best friend.

Bob, whose last name hasn't been released, was celebrating on New Year's Eve when he needed more firewood for his Michigan home.

He quickly ran out of his home in pajamas and slippers to grab a piece of wood when he slipped and fell, breaking his neck, according to CBS News.  

It was late and his screams for help went unheard by his neighbors, but luckily his canine pal, Kelsey was there to take action. 

Kelsey prevented Bob from becoming hypothermic by laying on top of him and licking his face and hands. 

She was there by his side as he laid in the snow paralyzed for nearly 20 hours. 

'She kept me warm and alert. I knew I had to persevere through this and that it was my choice to stay alive,' Bob said, adding that Kelsey kept him awake until lost consciousness.

Kelsey kept barking and the next day Bob's neighbor found him and called 911.

By the time he was rushed to the McLaren Northern Michigan hospital he had developed hypothermia. 

Doctors told CBS that Bob's core body temperature was under 70 degrees Fahrenheit. 

'I was surprised to find out that I didn't have any frostbite,' Bob said. 'I am sure it was because of Kelsey's determination.'

Chinese are outraged by news on social media that a Japanese hotel chain has allegedly been selling books which openly deny the Nanjing Massacre in China and forced prostitution in Korea during World War II.

The books are written by the CEO of the APA Group, who goes by his pen name, Seiji Fuji, in both English and Japanese languages. Chinese media's report said the books could be found in the drawers in every APA hotel room and for sale at the hotels' front desks.

As of September 2016, there were 413 hotels or resorts and 70,000 hotel rooms under the APA Group. During peak tourist season, about 40 percent of its hotel rooms are occupied by foreigners, half of them from China and South Korea.

A Sina Weibo user codenamed ""Katandsid""—Kat is from the US and Sid from China, was the first to expose APA hotels' selling such books on Thursday, followed by another video of these two alleged New York University students purchasing one of the books written by the APA CEO, at the front desk of an APA-owned hotel.

The book refers to the ""300,000 people were slaughtered in Nanking"" as ""falsehood"" and the Nanjing Massacre in China, ""comfort women"" and the forced prostitution in South Korea as ""untruths"".

The book also implies that the CEO is going to use the money earned from his hotel business to support his political views, according to the video.

Huangwang Group, a Chinese-funded travel company in Japan, issued a statement on Monday, saying that the company will stop providing services for reservations to APA hotels or for those who have checked into APA hotels, unless the APA CEO withdraws the books and publicly apologize for his misconduct.

Japanese troops captured Nanjing, city in east China's Jiangsu Province, on December 13, 1937 and started weeks of slaughter. About 300,000 Chinese were murdered. Over 20,000 women were raped.

Chinese President #XiJinping spoke highly of the China-Switzerland partnership on Sunday, saying it has become a paradigm of relations between countries of different sizes.

Accompanied by his Swiss counterpart Doris Leuthard, Xi made the remarks during a tea chat on a special train of the Swiss government running from Zurich to Bern, during his ongoing visit to the European country.

Appreciating the years' commitment of Leuthard to deepening the two countries' cooperation in all areas, Xi said he is glad to visit Switzerland at the beginning of 2017 and attend the World Economic Forum (#WEF).

As one of the first Western countries to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the People' s Republic of China, Switzerland has taken the lead in developing cooperation with China, recording a trove of ""firsts"" in this process, Xi said.

He cited Switzerland's lead on the continental Europe to sign and implement a free trade agreement with China, and join the China-proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

In 2016, Switzerland became the first and only country to set up a strategic partnership with China featuring innovation.

""During this visit, I would like to engage in in-depth talks with President Leuthard and other Swiss leaders, to enrich our partnership, and boost our cooperation in all areas,"" Xi said.

He added that China, sharing similar views with Switzerland on many international issues, wishes to work with the European nation to enhance their coordination in international affairs.

Noting that China encourages more and more Chinese tourists to travel to Switzerland, Xi said China, which is to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, stands ready to promote cooperation with Switzerland on developing winter sports.

For her part, Leuthard thanked Xi for choosing her country as the destination of his first state visit in 2017, saying the decision represents the importance China has attached to Switzerland.

Switzerland stands ready to push forward cooperation with China on various fields, said Leuthard.

China is an influential country in the world, said Leuthard, adding that the international community looks forward to hearing Xi's exposition of China's policies at the WEF as the world is facing many uncertainties right now, said the Swiss leader.

Xi will deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the WEF annual meeting on Tuesday to share the views of the world's second largest economy on charting the course for globalization.

During the chat, the two leaders also exchanged views on such issues as Belt and Road Initiative and green development.

188625661189259_1405690536149426,"Xi's world vision: a community of common destiny, a shared home for humanity #XiVisit #WEF17

Thousands of years ago, China envisaged a world where people live in perfect harmony and are as dear to one another as family. Today, President Xi Jinping has given the world a new name -- a community of common destiny.
Since Xi first proposed the concept in late 2012, it has gone on to shape China's approach to global governance, giving rise to proposals and measures to support growth for all.
There is the new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation, and the Belt and Road Initiative set out to better connect the world. Xi has also come up with a new security concept that is designed to pool efforts to build universal, sustainable and comprehensive security.
""The concept of a community of common destiny transcends all sorts of differences in human society and targets greatest possible benefits for all,"" said Tang Qifang, a researcher with the China Institute of International Studies.
At the United Nations Office at Geneva on Jan. 18, Xi will deliver a keynote speech on building such a community, sending the message again that China is fully committed to creating ""one home for all of mankind,"" as Xi called it in his 2017 New Year speech.
""This is a very advanced notion born out of changing world conditions, and an embodiment of the Chinese aspiration to share peace and development with the world,"" Tang said.
EQUAL PARTNERSHIPS
In his first diplomatic activity as China's top leader in late 2012, Xi shared his perception that ""the world has increasingly grown into a community where one's destiny is interwoven with that of another."" The concept came up time and again in his speeches over the years that followed.
According to Xi's vision, our future lies in the hands of all countries -- equally -- and all nations should pursue dialogue rather than confrontation with one another, and forge partnerships instead of alliances.
China is working to expand convergence of interests with more and more countries, such as Pakistan, Laos and Cambodia, and form communities of common destiny on a bilateral basis.
It has also approached nations in Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East to develop similar communities by pushing forward win-win cooperation.
In the course of pursuing equal partnerships, China has actively participated in reforming the global governance system by addressing unreasonable and unjust aspects of the system.
While addressing the Business 20 (B20) summit in Hangzhou last year, Xi highlighted equitable and efficient global financial governance, open and transparent global trade and investment governance, green and low-carbon global energy governance, as well as inclusive and interconnected global development governance, as priorities for global economic governance, showcasing China's commitment to contributing its wisdom to the world economic growth.
Also as part of its efforts in this regard, China champions better representation and say of developing countries in the international governance system, calling for the equal participation of all countries in making rules.
""China's vote in the United Nations will always belong to developing countries,"" Xi told the general debate of the 70th session of the UN General Assembly in September 2015.
He also advocated valuing both righteousness and interests in shaping international relations, saying that righteousness comes first.
This has become an important principle guiding China's cooperation with other developing nations, and the rationale for China's rush to the aid of other countries at times of difficulties.
China was there to help African countries during the Ebola outbreak, to help save lives after earthquakes in Nepal and Ecuador, and to alleviate the water shortage in the Maldives.
""In Xi Jinping, and messages he has delivered, the world sees a China that embraces its responsibilities, stands by developing countries through thick and thin, and participates in setting international rules and reforming the global governance system,"" said Tang Zhimin, director of China ASEAN studies at Thailand's Panyapiwat Institute of Management.
INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT
In the community of common destiny, the development of one country is closely intertwined with that of other countries.
""China will always work to contribute to global development,"" Xi said during the UN general debate, welcoming other countries to get on board China's express train of development. ""Development for all is development for real.""
The Belt and Road Initiative was proposed in this spirit, as was the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the South-South Cooperation Fund, and increased investment by China in the world's least developed countries.
The AIIB has allocated loans totaling 1.73 billion U.S. dollars in nine infrastructure projects across seven countries since it started operating in January 2016.
Connecting some 60 countries, the Belt and Road Initiative has been aligned with many national and regional development strategies, bringing forth more and more cooperative projects, including railways, roads and ports.
The Initiative will gain greater popularity because ""in it, the interests of many parties converge and with it, the common development of mankind will be promoted,"" said Cui Hongjian, director of the department of European studies at the China Institute of International Studies.
In addition to these development efforts, China has placed great emphasis on creating a safer world to make sustainable development possible, evident in its proposed solutions to risks and conflicts, and increased support for UN peace efforts.
In 2015, Xi promoted a concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security to tackle challenges. ""No country can single-handedly seek absolute security for itself, and neither can it gain stability from unrest in other countries,"" he said.
China does not pay lip service to the cause of peace. It takes action.
Currently, nearly 2,500 Chinese military personnel are involved in nine UN peacekeeping operations. From 2016 to 2018, China will account for 10.2 percent of the UN Peacekeeping assessed contributions.
In 26 years of involvement in peacekeeping missions, China has lost 13 soldiers.
With its constructive proposals and active participation in peacekeeping operations, China has contributed greatly to promoting world peace and multilateralism, said Zhu Shuai, a researcher at the China Center for Information Industry Development.
""China has shown to the world that as a responsible country, it will continue efforts toward the goal of achieving common development for mankind,"" Zhu said.

A Shared Commitment to Practical Cooperation and Peaceful Development

By H.E. Xi Jinping

President of the People's Republic of China

I am very pleased to come to the beautiful country of Switzerland for my first overseas trip in 2017. This is the first time for me to visit Switzerland as Chinese President and the first state visit by a Chinese head of state in the new century.

The well-known Swiss poet and Nobel laureate Carl Spitteler once said that there is no greater happiness than having friends who share the same outlook and destiny with oneself. During my visit, I will have talks and meetings with leaders of the Swiss Federal Council and Federal Assembly and have extensive contact and discussion with people from various sectors. I will also attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2017 in Davos and visit the headquarters of UN agencies and international organizations in Geneva and Lausanne. I am very much looking forward to this trip.

Despite the great distance between our two countries, the Chinese people are no strangers to Switzerland. Known as the roof of Europe and a leader in innovation, Switzerland boasts beautiful landscape, hard-working people and an advanced economy.

The exchange and cooperation between us go back a long way. In the early 20th century, Swiss-made clocks and watches, medicine, textiles and mechanical products were already sold in China, and Swiss financial and insurance services also had presence there.

In 1950, Switzerland was one of the first Western countries to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with New China. In 1954, Premier Zhou Enlai led the Chinese delegation to the Geneva Conference, unveiling to the world the diplomatic style and approach of the young People' s Republic.

Shortly after China began its reform and opening-up program in the late 1970s, a Swiss company set up the first industrial joint venture in China. At the start of this century, Switzerland was among the first European countries to recognize China as a full market economy.

In recent years, Switzerland became the first European continental country to conclude and implement a free trade agreement with China. Our two countries have taken pioneering and innovative steps in our engagement with each other, such as Switzerland' s support for the internationalization of the RMB, its participation in the founding of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and mutual visa exemption for diplomatic passport-holders of our two countries. These have set a good example for cooperation between China and other European countries.

The China-Switzerland relationship is growing from strength to strength. During his state visit to China last April, President Johann Schneider-Ammann and I announced the establishment of an innovative strategic partnership between the two countries, the first of its kind for China featuring innovation. This marked a new phase of our bilateral relations.

The relations between our countries are a model of friendship and cooperation between countries that are different in size, social system and development stage. This is made possible by our people' s mutual goodwill, by a shared commitment to growing our bilateral relations on the basis of equality, innovation and win-win cooperation, and above all, by our respect for each other' s social system and development path.

In a complex and fast-changing world beset by weak economic recovery, China and Switzerland need to work together to deepen the innovative strategic partnership across the board. This will not only benefit our peoples and grow China-Europe relations, but also contribute to the steady progress of international relations, global recovery and fair trade.

Going forward, we need to deepen our engagement in the following areas:

- Maintaining high-level exchanges. We should leverage the dialogue and consultation mechanisms at various levels and show mutual understanding and support on issues concerning each other' s core interests and major concerns.

- Breaking new ground in practical cooperation. The newly established Sino-Swiss High-level Innovative Dialogue will enable us to promote collaboration between our companies, universities and research institutes and in energy conservation, environmental protection, climate change, IPR protection, financial services, eco-agriculture and social security. We may also increase coordination and cooperation at the UN and other multilateral organizations and in international affairs, work for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and promote stability in the world.

- Expanding people-to-people exchanges. With the signing of the new cultural cooperation agreement, the establishment of the Chinese cultural center in Bern and the launch of the year of tourism, we are well placed to expand people-to-people and youth exchanges, facilitate personnel visits, and beef up cooperation in tourism, winter sports and vocational education and at the subnational level. All this will help cement public support for China-Switzerland relations.

- Improving our Free Trade Area. We may actively explore the possibility of upgrading the Free Trade Agreement, and set a good example of promoting the free and open international trade and investment system. We may also step up China-Europe cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative through the AIIB and the cooperation mechanism between China and Central and Eastern European countries.

In September 2016, the G20 Hangzhou Summit took place by the picturesque West Lake. During the summit, China worked with other parties to strive for consensus and inject momentum into the efforts to build an innovative, invigorated, interconnected and inclusive world economy. As I make my first trip to Davos for the WEF annual meeting, I look forward to candid and in-depth exchanges with the participants. It is a good opportunity to boost confidence in rising to challenges and re-energize world economic growth.

Davos is a well-known town. At the start of each new year, people from different regions, countries and backgrounds would come and meet here. Such a meeting of minds has always been under international spotlight. This has been especially so in the wake of the global financial crisis, when the WEF annual meetings have emerged as a major platform for brainstorming, dialogue and cooperation. Sticking together in times of difficulty, this is the very spirit that has helped to put the world economy on the path of recovery.

We meet at a time of angst about the prospects of the world economy, growing backlash against economic globalization, and rising populism and trade protectionism. There is a stronger call for revisiting and changing the current paths of development, systems of wealth distribution and models of governance. The direction of the world economy is a subject of heated discussion.

China has been working with European countries, among others, to address the challenges facing global development. We have taken the initiative to adapt to the fluid external environment and the ""new normal"" of the Chinese economy. We have followed the vision of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development, and made good progress in deepening supply-side structural reform and fostering new growth drivers. China will continue to be a huge market supporting world economic growth, a hot destination attracting foreign investment and a contributor to the well-being of people around the world.

Geneva has a prominent place in the international relations of the modern era. The city has witnessed the development of inter-governmental organizations such as the UN and its specialized agencies, served as the venue for negotiating key agreements on hotspot issues, including the Iranian nuclear issue, Syriaand the Middle East peace process, and facilitated the adoption of many international treaties and legal instruments, notably the Geneva Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

After regaining its lawful seat in the UN and returning to various international organizations in Geneva in 1971, China has deepened its involvement in the governance of peace, security, development, human rights and social agenda, making its due contribution to the lofty cause of peace and development. Decades of hard work, especially multilateral diplomacy practised here in Geneva, has inspired the people in China and elsewhere to establish the notions and principles of sovereign equality, peaceful reconciliation, the rule of law and justice, openness and inclusiveness, and humanitarianism. These reflect both the Geneva spirit of multilateralism and the fine tradition of Chinese diplomacy.

I will visit the United NationsOffice at Geneva with the following goals in mind: reviewing our shared historical journey, championing the widely accepted principles of diplomacy, exploring ways to realize the vision of building a community of shared future for mankind, and seeking ideas on how we can make the world a better place.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized UN agency dedicated to global health issues. It has done its best to improve global health governance and safeguard the well-being of all people. Health is a high priority on China' s development agenda and a key area of its international cooperation. Cooperation with the WHO has helped to improve China' s national health programs and represents a contribution to global health endeavors. I look forward to an extensive discussion with Director General Margaret Chan on this subject.

The International Olympic Movement, in its over 100 years, has played a positive role in enhancing all-round human development, deepening friendship between nations and promoting peace, development and progress. China, a long-time supporter and member of the Olympic Movement, has hosted the Beijing 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games, and is actively preparing for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. I am glad to visit the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and learn from President Thomas Bach and the IOC their ideas about promoting the Olympic spirit and advancing the Olympic Movement.

In short, I look forward to my upcoming trip to Switzerland, where I will meet people from different walks of life to promote cooperation and innovation. Hopefully, the trip will give a strong impetus to China' s relations with Switzerland, Europe, the UN and the Olympic Movement in the year ahead. http://bit.ly/2jf0rZb",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1404538069598006/?type=3,2017-01-13 20:30:20,3134,46,67,3089,29,11,0,2,3

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Wednesday that ""I think it was Russia"" behind the cyberattacks targetting the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

""As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,"" said Trump at his first press conference in New York since winning the election in November.

""He (Russian President Vladimir Putin) shouldn't be doing it. He won't be doing it,"" said Trump. ""Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading than when other people have led it.""

Trump's first public acknowledgement came after months of denial and sometimes even disparagement of U.S. intelligence community.
Since October, the U.S. intelligence community had accused Russians of being responsible for the hacking that led to the leaking of damaging materials which dogged Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton till the Election Day.

The city's municipal government on Monday held a forum focusing on measures and prevention on alleviating smog. During the forum, officials reaffirmed three major reasons for the cause of sulphur dioxide exceeding the standard. First, coal burning by residents, the sulphur dioxide emission of which accounted for 70% of the total; Second, industrial sulphur dioxide emissions from coal-burning industry; Third, the special topography that aggravates the dispersion of sulphur dioxide.

The British government has asked nuclear regulators to embark on the process for approving a Chinese-designed reactor for a proposed plant in the UK.

General Nuclear Services (GNS), an industrial partnership between French utility firm EDF and Chinese utility giant, China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), is looking to use the design at a planned new nuclear station in Bradwell, Essex.

A new statement from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the agency had asked the country's independent nuclear regulators, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, and the Environment Agency, to begin a Generic Design Assessment (GDA) of the British version of HPR1000, a third-generation nuclear technology to which China has exclusive intellectual property rights.

GDA is a professional process for approving a new nuclear reactor and usually takes about 4 years.

CGN is planning to make several investments in Britain's nuclear power sector, most notably the new Hinkley Point C project in southwest England. The $24 billion project, built by EDF and supported by $8 billion of cash from CGN, gained a green light from the UK government in September last year.

The decision to grant Hinkley is seen by some as a move to address concerns that Prime Minister Theresa May was less receptive to foreign investment than her predecessor David Cameron, particularly investments from China which has plans to invest in the UK's infrastructure.

Britain needs to fill an electricity supply gap over the next decade as many of its ageing nuclear plants are due to close by 2030 and its inefficient coal plants are forced to close by 2025.

China is working to set up the world's highest altitude gravitational wave telescopes in Tibet Autonomous Region to detect the faintest echoes resonating from the universe, which may reveal more about the Big Bang.

Construction has started for the first telescope, code-named Ngari No.1, 30 km south of Shiquanhe Town in Ngari Prefecture, said Yao Yongqiang, chief researcher with the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The telescope, located 5,250 meters above sea level, will detect and gather precise data on primordial gravitational waves in the Northern Hemisphere. It is expected to be operational by 2021.

Yao said the second phase involves a series of telescopes, code-named Ngari No. 2, to be located about 6,000 meters above sea level. He did not give a time frame for construction of Ngari No. 2.

The budget for the two-phase Ngari gravitational wave observatory is an estimated 130 million yuan (18.8 million U.S. dollars). The project was initiated by the Institute of High Energy Physics, National Astronomical Observatories, and Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, among others.

Ngari, with its high altitude, clear sky, and minimal human activity, is said to be one of the world's best spots to detect tiny twists in cosmic light.

Yao said the Ngari observatory will be among the world's top primordial gravitational wave observation bases, alongside the South Pole Telescope and the facility in Chile's Atacama Desert.

Gravitational waves were first proposed by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity 100 years ago, but it wasn't until 2016 that scientists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory announced proof of the waves' existence, spurring fresh research interest among the world's scientists.

188625661189259_1398184800233333,"What could possibly go wrong? Shocking video of a young child riding an 8ft #ALLIGATOR at a birthday party

An astonishing video has emerged of a young girl riding a fully grown #alligator during a kids' party in the States.
The youngster grips on to the fearsome predator's back and attempts to pose for a photo for her mother but the animal instead carries her away to the laughter of excited children and parents, off camera.
The controversial footage, which was allegedly shot during one of Jim Nesci's Cold Blooded Creatures' events, which promote 'conservation through education', has started to go viral.

The #Chicago-based company throws children's birthday parties with Bubba the alligator described as 'a living dinosaur'. 
The video was shot at one of these educational events, according to Viral Nova. 

Bubba was rescued from the Chicago area and is over 8ft long and weighs over 90kg, according to the company's website.
The short clip, which has attracted almost 30,000 YouTube views, is entitled Katie Rides An Alligator and has been making waves online after re-emerging recently, although it was shot in 2013.

The shocking video begins with the reptile pacing slowly along a mat, seemingly weighed down by the child on its back.
A trainer tells the girl of around seven-years-old to put her thumbs up so that her mother can take a photograph.
But as the creature lies on the ground, the anxious child leaps off it at the first opportunity.
She is coaxed by the adults to sit back on the alligator for the camera.
The youngster poses with her thumbs up but is carried away by the creature as it veers away from the spectator trying to take her photograph.
Katie smiles, the animal flashes its teeth and hilarity ensues among the off camera audience. Coming to a halt the animal lies on the ground and the trainer says 'good boy'.
A child's voice off camera can be heard exclaiming: 'That's awesome.' 
From the footage it is unclear what level of risk the 'tamed' creature poses to the child.
Outraged commenters have slammed the footage for putting the child in danger and criticised it as animal abuse.
Three days ago, Youtuber SimplyLatino wrote: 'This isn't funny at all. That animal can easily turn and kill that little girl. This is simply irresponsible. '

Through reptile education programmes and parties families can also opt to ride a giant tortoise or hold a python.
Jim Nesci is described on his website as 'an experienced expert in the reptile industry' who has appeared with his reptiles on The Oprah Show, Animal Planet and The Tonight Show, among others.
Commenting on the footage, Elisa Allen, Director from Peta UK told MailOnline: 'Remember the outrage when Steve Irwin dangled his child near an alligator? Such foolhardy behaviour risks a child's life, and this child's parents should be reported to social services.
'Since alligators are deadly predators, common sense tells us that it's dangerous and witless to place children on their backs. 
'Keeping alligators captive and treating them as wind-up toys is also detrimental to their health and well-being. These wild animals should be left in peace, not harassed by humans and certainly not treated as part of some callous and idiotic sideshow.'
American alligators can grow up to 11 feet long and can weigh 450kg and reside in rivers, lakes and swamps in the southern United States.
They are carnivores and have a bite force of 2,125 pounds per square inch, which is the third most powerful bite of the animal kingdom, according to Science Focus.
Last June, MailOnline reported on a toddler who was killed by an alligator at Disney World in Florida.
Lane Graves was paddling just ten feet from the shore of the Seven Seas Lagoon at the upscale resort on June 14 when he was attacked by the predator and dragged into the water.
His body was found 'intact' in the water 17 hours later.

Beijing will close its last three coal mines in the next four years and entirely quit coal mining by 2020, sources with the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform said.

In 2016, Beijing closed two coal mines with a total annual production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes, said Li Bin, deputy director of the coal management office at the commission.

By 2020, Beijing will completely bid farewell to the coal mining industry, Li said.

Beijing has a coal mining history of nearly 800 years. The earliest official historical documents on coal mining date from the Yuan Dynasty(1271-1368), Li said, adding that during the following Ming and Qing dynasties, west Beijing's mountainous area became renowned as a high-quality coal production base.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of #China in 1949, coal produced in west Beijing's mountainous area has served as a major energy source for the capital's social and economic development, said Geng Yangmou, chairman of Beijing Haohua Energy Resource.

Statistics show that Beijing's coal consumption in 2010 was over 26 million tonnes, with the number declining to about 12 million tonnes in 2015.

Geng said the central and the Beijing municipal governments allocated more than 160 million yuan (23.2 million U.S. dollars) in subsidies to local coal workers and miners in 2016.

The anti-corruption battle must go deeper, Chinese President #XiJinping said Friday, calling for strict governance of the Communist Party of #China (CPC) systematically, creatively and effectively.

#Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at the seventh plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), which opened Friday.

The guidelines established at the sixth plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee should be implemented in a comprehensive manner, Xi said, adding that new practices must be guided with renewed understanding.

The values of Communists must be upheld, and ideals and belief should be firmed with cultural confidence, Xi said, stressing the need to maintain the seriousness of political life in the Party and strengthen intra-Party supervision.

The president said efforts should be made to address both symptoms and root causes of corruption, comprehensively strengthen discipline and to constantly improve work styles.

The meeting was chaired by top graft buster Wang Qishan and attended by leaders including Li Keqiang, Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.

""Managing and running the Party is not only linked to the fate of the Party itself, but is also related to the future and fate of the nation,"" Xi stressed, adding that the Party should address this issue with greater resolution, efforts and courage.

""Only by managing the Party soundly can we successfully lead the people in handling major challenges, hedge against major risks, overcome major obstacles and solve major contradictions, achieving one victory after another,"" Xi said.

Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, ""comprehensively and strictly governing the Party"" has been included in the strategic blueprint, and efforts have been made to manage the Party stringently and carefully, according to Xi.

Nothing is off-limits in the anti-corruption efforts, and zero tolerance has been shown toward corruption, Xi said, underscoring that the spread of corruption has been curbed and corruption cases that directly impact people's direct interests have been dealt with.

Thanks to the concerted efforts of the entire Party, the Party's discipline has been strengthened, Xi said, adding that ""the spread of corruption has been effectively contained and the battle against corruption has gained crushing momentum.""

""The objective of ensuring officials do not dare to be corrupt has been basically achieved,"" Xi said, concluding that a new atmosphere is emerging in the political life within the Party.

Strict and comprehensive governance of the Party, despite achieving remarkable progress since the 18th CPC National Congress, remains an arduous task, Xi stressed.

Implementing frugality rules is a ""tenacious"" and ""protracted"" battle, Xi said, calling for unwavering resolution.

The battle against corruption will not relax one bit, and the ""zero tolerance"" principle will not change, Xi said, calling for ""resolutely winning the battle of justice against corruption"".

Xi called for advancing reforms to the state supervisory system, and urged discipline inspection commissions at all levels to strengthen self-supervision and accept intra-Party and social supervision to build a reliable team of cadres.

Xi also called for treating both root causes and symptoms in advancing strict and comprehensive Party governance.

Xi stressed adhering to the values of Communists and improving one's political conscientiousness.

Party members are confronted with ""choices between public and private interests, righteousness and self-interest, virtue and vice, hardship and indulgence,"" Xi said, adding that it is political conscientiousness that determines their choices.

Unshakable ideals and beliefs stem from cultural confidence, Xi noted, adding they must be grown and nourished in traditional Chinese culture, revolutionary culture, and socialist advanced culture.

Xi also ordered Party members and cadres to stay away from vulgarity. Rather than catering to vulgar taste, they should elevate themselves spiritually to be people of integrity, prudence, and rectitude.

Xi said senior officials of the CPC should take the lead in practicing strict intra-Party political life, always act with a correct political direction and stick to the Party's political stance and principles.

Xi urged Party officials to conform with the CPC Central Committee both in thoughts and actions, as well as to implement the CPC Central Committee's major policies without reservations.

Xi also underscored the importance of persistence in strengthening intra-Party supervision, urging Party organizations at various levels to be bold and serious in Party supervision and ""cracking hard nuts.""

Xi asked officials to be candid, frank and sincere.

Wang said studying Xi's remarks is ""an important political task for the entire Party,"" asking authorities to maintain a sound intra-Party political environment and prepare for the 19th CPC National Congress to be held this year.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1397967723588374/?type=3,2017-01-06 14:39:08,1766,36,49,1741,14,4,1,0,6

China and Kyrgyzstan on Friday vowed to deepen security cooperation and jointly fight terrorist forces such as the East #Turkistan #Islamic Movement.

The pledge came out of a meeting between Chinese President #Xi Jinping and Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev in Beijing.

During the meeting, the two leaders agreed to jointly combat the ""three evil forces"" of terrorism, separatism and extremism.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Kyrgyzstan, said Xi, saying bilateral ties have reached an unprecedented height.

Xi attributed the achievements in bilateral ties to the adherence to the principle of good-neighborliness, mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation by the two sides.

The two countries have demonstrated mutual support on issues regarding each other's core interests and concerns and maintained close communication and coordination on major international and regional affairs, said Xi.

He said China and Kyrgyzstan have become true good friends, neighbors and partners.

China is willing to work with Kyrgyzstan for new highlights in cooperation and to push forward the bilateral strategic partnership, he said.

Xi spoke highly of the achievements by the two nations in the #BeltandRoad Initiative, calling on the two sides to speed up construction of major infrastructure projects, enhance cooperation in production capacity, promote cooperation among small and medium-sized enterprises and dovetail the Belt and Road Initiative with the #Eurasian Economic Union.

China is ready to deepen coordination with Kyrgyzstan within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (#SCO), he said.

China has remained the world's major growth engine in 2016, shoring up global economic growth through such channels as trade, market and investment.

The latest report of the International Monetary Fund showed that China contributed 1.2 percentage points to global economy growth in 2016, while the United States contributed 0.3 percentage points and #Europe 0.2 percentage points.

China's economy is shifting toward a development model of lower rate and higher quality, while structural reforms allow its economy to upgrade and eventually unleash new vitality and continue to serve as an engine of global economic growth.

Data showed that China became the single largest contributor to global economic growth in 2009 and its contribution to world growth has since been leading other economies.

Chinese imports have amounted to 9 trillion U.S. dollars over the last five years, and the country, with a huge demand, has helped drive the economic growth of countries worldwide.

In the next few years, China's economy is expected to maintain its high speed of growth, and its immense demand for raw materials and manufactured goods will provide strong support for growth in many countries.

From the perspective of outbound investment, China has become an important source of foreign investment in many countries. From January to November 2016, China's total foreign investment was 1,070 billion yuan (153 billion U.S. dollars at current price), representing a substantial increase of 55 percent from 2015.

In January 2015, a fire in one of #Russia's largest university libraries damaged more than 1 million historical documents, an incident which some media described as a ""cultural Chernobyl"".
Important documents of our age can probably avoid the same fate in the future thanks to a new fire-resistant paper developed by a team of scientists at the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Zhu Yingjie, a researcher from the institute, and his team developed a set of methods to produce paper with a new material, hydroxyapatite, the inorganic constituent of tooth enamel and bone.
The invention was reported on ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, a peer-reviewed scientific journal of the American Chemical Society.
The inorganic material is both fire resistant and water resistant.
""Traditionally, paper is made of plant fibers, which are easily destroyed by liquid. Previous research attempts to produce waterproof paper found it was difficult to achieve fire retardancy and water repellency at the same time,"" Zhu said.
In 2013, a doctorate student of Zhu was preparing hydroxyapatite nanowires. While he wanted to filter out the water and continue the experiment, he found that instead of getting hydroxyapatite powder on the filter paper, a film formed on the paper.
The discovery inspired Zhu. He conducted more experiments to improve the material's physical properties.
""Traditional papermaking damages natural woods and damages the environment. Hydroxyapatite nanowires are an ideal building material for paper,"" Zhu said.

The satellites -- three big and 100 small -- will be launched into space by the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the southern spaceport of Sriharikota, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) scientists said at Indian Science Congress in the southern temple town of Tirupati Wednesday.

The PSLV C37 will carry one satellite of the Cartosat series, two small ISRO satellites and 100 small commercial satellites, mostly from the US while the rest from other nations including France and Germany.

Earlier the plan was to launch 83 satellites, but it was modified to 100 in a single mission due to the addition of 20 more foreign satellites recently, the scientists said.

The launch will be a record one as this will be the first time in ISRO's history that such a large number of satellites will be sent to space at one go. India had in June 2016 launched some 22 satellites into space in a single mission.

As of now, the record for the most number of satellites launched in a single mission belongs to Russia, which sent up 37 satellites in 2014. US space agency Nasa launched 29.

Launching several satellites at one go reduces cost and India has been trying to position itself as a key player in the lucrative international commercial space market as an effective but low-cost operator.

 A car exploded near a compound run by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in the Somali capital Mogadishu on Wednesday, injuring four security guards.

The UNDP confirmed the incident, saying ""all UNDP staff are safe and sound"" after the blast.

The injured are staff from a private security company, according to the UN agency.

Somalia-based extremist group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it targeted UNDP staff.

Somali security forces have arrested nine suspected Al-Shabaab members in nearby areas for alleged involvement in the attack.

The explosion comes barely two days after a twin car bomb attack killed at least two people near the UN base in Mogadishu.

Al-Shabaab militants launched an ambush on the UNDP compound in Mogadishu in June 2013, killing 15 people.

The group has carried out frequent attacks in Somalia, many of them in Mogadishu, in its decade-long fight against the government.

With cars stretching as far as the eye can see, this is one traffic jam you don't want to be in. According to local media, it took vehicles some three hours to pass the toll station.

An incredibly adorable bald eaglet has finally broken out of its shell in its #Florida nest. 
Eagle parents, Harriet and M15, are Fort Myers' most beloved bald eagles and onlookers from across the globe watched eagerly as the pair welcomed their first hatchling Saturday morning, CTV News reported. 
After it was born, the baby bird was heard singing as Harriet and M15 continued their wait for their second egg to hatch.

The hatchling began tapping on its shell Thursday but took until Saturday morning to finally break from its shell.  
Both eggs were expected to hatch between Christmas and News Year's Day.  
And since the second egg has yet to hatch, some are speculating that the sibling eaglets may be born in 2016 and 2017. 

At one point the mama bird left her nest, allowing viewers to get a good look at the newest addition to the bald eagle family. 
The little ball of fluff waited patiently for its mother to return and even chirped a little. 
Once Harriet came back to the nest, she carefully maneuvered her body so that the egg and her hatchling would fit comfortably under her belly.   
A video live stream, provided by Florida real estate company Dick Pritchett Real Estate, captured the incredible moment the baby emerged from its shell. 

The nest is not in a wildlife refuge, but rather in a residential area in Fort Myers. 
Throughout the process, both Harriet and M15, have continuously taken turns incubating their young by maintaining the 105-degree temperature necessary for the embryos to develop properly, according to KING 5.
As the eagle parents prepare for their eggs to hatch, they will nurture them until they feel movement and the chick scratches the inside the surface of the egg.
During the last two to three days before hatching, the parents can hear and feel activity inside the egg and will watch the egg closely, the station reported.

The increasing number of Tibetan Mastiffs, a kind of fierce domestic dog, in the wild is threatening the lives of wild animals like snow leopards in Sanjiangyuan, northwest China's Qinghai province.

The rare scene can be mainly attributed to the fading favour for the dogs in recent years. Lots of them, originally raised for sale in Qinghai province, have been abandoned by their owners, a report by sohu.com says.

Best known for their giant size and loyalty to their owners, Tibetan Mastiffs have been raised in almost every shepherd household in Sanjiangyuan to protect sheep from wolves.

About 10 years ago, a fever for owning a Tibetan Mastiff started to spread across China, especially among wealthy families in cities. At the peak of the trend, lots of buyers from east China came to Sanjiangyuan to find a pet, and a good Mastiff could be sold for as high as millions of yuan. Many people in Sanjiangyuan started to breed the dog.

However, the price for Tibetan Mastiffs started to plummet after 2010 and lots of dogs were abandoned, as the cost of feeding the giant dog is very high.

The abandoned Tibetan Mastiffs not only grab food from other wild animals, they also attack livestock and even people on the road. Environmental experts also warn that the dog could also bring fatal infectious diseases to other animals.

So far, the report says, about 5,000 stray Tibetan Mastiffs have been captured and cared for in 5 animal shelters in Yushu, an autonomous prefecture in Sanjiangyuan. However, authorities say more measures need to be taken as the abandoned Tibetan Mastiffs are still growing in number and they are not being taken care of in the rest of Sanjiangyuan.

The trains' speed has been enhanced to 300 kilometers per hour, reducing travel from one end of the line to the other to just 11 hours, compared to the previous direct regular rail between Shanghai and Kunming which took a whopping 35-40 hours.

Starting from January 5 of next year, the high-speed rail will also cut travel times from Hangzhou to Kunming to around 9 hours, 5.5 hours if passengers embark from Nanchang, and 4 hours from Changsha.

he new Shanghai-Kunming high-speed railway makes it possible for tourists in neighboring provinces such as Sichuan to make trips there on weekends.

As of December 20, 2016, 60 percent of the cities, including 54 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, experienced the level of severe or worse rated by the daily average air quality index. The figure had already improved from that of the previous day. Among them, 42 cities had reached severe level; 35 of them were in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.  

Shijiazhuang in north China's Hebei Province was the most polluted city on the 20th, with record showing its PM2.5 reached 614 micrograms/cubic meters, while Beijing reached daily 376 micrograms/cubic meters of PM 2.5.

Measures have been set up in the affected cities to battle with smog, including emission reduction measuring; restricting vehicle-use; real-time monitoring; deploying more pure electric buses; and censoring the largest industrial air pollutant emission process. 

It is forecasted that the forth coming cold air will encourage pollutant dispersal and the severe weather will be alleviated in many cities. Beijing will lift its red alert for air pollution after Wednesday night as cold air is expected to drift in.

At the China Robot Industry Conference in Wuhu, Anhui Province, data released by China Robot Industry Alliance (CRIA), a non-profit organization, showed that 19,000 industrial robots were sold in China in the first half of 2016.

Applied to various manufacturing tasks including packaging, welding and assembly, industrial robots are more widely used and the market has grown from 8.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2013 to 12.3 billion dollars in 2015, according to International Federation of Robotics. China has been the largest consumer since 2013.

From January to November in 2016, China produced 64,000 industrial robots, over 90 percent more than all production in 2015. Nearly 3,000 robot manufacturers have sprung up in China over the last five years, but current industrial standards are inadequate.

The market needs new standards designed by the government and the market, said Xie Bingbing, deputy chief engineer of the Beijing Research Institute for the Automation for the Machinery Industry.

At the conference, the CRIA released new standards for industrial robots, providing a technical guide for manufacturers. The CRIA is now working on standards for service robots.

Astronomical calculation suggests the moon will arrive at the perigee at 7 am Tuesday, when its diameter looks longer than any other time. At 8:06 am Wednesday, the full moon will shine as it's exactly between the earth and the sun, reflecting sunlight directly to the planet.

China is making an effort to restore the majestic grandeur of the Forbidden City by the government starting a sweeping renovation of a 233-meter-long section of the palace walls.

The opening ceremony for the first stage of construction was held at the Palace Museum on Saturday, November 26.

Originally built in the Ming Dynasty, the Forbidden City walls have stood for around 600 years.

The section of the city wall under restoration that has shown distinct signs of wear and tear is located north of the First Historical Archives inside the Xihua Gate.

Director of the Palace Museum, Shan Qixiang, said a comprehensive survey on the section of the wall has been carried out and a scientific renovation plan had been made.

The restoration work would focus on the inside of the city wall and the stones that it's built upon.

This section of the wall has been restored a number of times, including twice between 1930s and 1970s, as well as several times in the 1990s.

Located in the heart of Beijing, the Forbidden City, built between 1408 and 1420, is now known as the Palace Museum.

It is the world's biggest palace and was home to China's Imperial rulers from the early years of the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644) to the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911).",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1345822088802938/?type=3,2016-11-27 16:05:00,8274,35,283,8154,67,44,6,3,0

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday urged members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to stay committed to taking economic globalization forward with vigorous measures, despite increasing setbacks around the world.

Speaking at the 24th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting here in Peru, Xi highlighted the APEC's role as a pioneer, leader and trailblazer of economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and the world at large, and called on APEC members to leverage the Asia-Pacific's role as a growth engine and work for an innovative, invigorated, interconnected and inclusive world economy.

Currently, the world economy still finds itself in profound adjustment, with weak recovery and more divergent growth, said Xi, adding that economic globalization has encountered setbacks, as evidenced by sluggish international trade and investment and rising protectionism.

Citing the blueprint for strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive world economic growth produced by the G20 Hangzhou Summit in September, the Chinese president said it embodies the spirit of partnership to jointly rise to challenges as well as the commitment to common development.

At the high-level gathering of APEC economic leaders, Xi called on the APEC economies to stay committed to taking economic globalization forward, increasing openness in the Asia-Pacific economy, breaking bottlenecks in regional connectivity and blazing new trails in reform and innovation.

On the building of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), which was launched at the 2014 APEC meeting in Beijing, Xi hailed the smooth completion of the collective strategic study this year, saying it marked a new phase in FTAAP development.

""We need to stick to our agenda and take more effective actions to realize the FTAAP at an early date, thus bringing about an Asia-Pacific economy with greater openness,"" said the Chinese president.

He recalled that China has given priority to opening up to the Asia-Pacific over the past 25 years since it joined the APEC, and pledged to work with other parties to increase openness, pursue regional economic integration and connectivity, advance reform and innovation, and jointly write an exciting chapter of Asia-Pacific cooperation.

Xi arrived in Peru on Friday to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting and pay his first state visit to the Latin American country.

The APEC meeting, hosted by Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, took place Saturday and Sunday in Lima, capital of Peru, under the theme of ""Quality Growth and Human Development.""

Xi's Quito trip is the first state visit by a Chinese head of state to Ecuador in 36 years since the two countries forged diplomatic relations in 1980.

During his stay in Quito, Xi will exchange views with Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa on bilateral ties, according to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Chao.

The two presidents will also witness the signing of a series of deals, meet with the press and attend a launch ceremony of an assistance program together. A joint statement is expected to be issued by the two sides.

Xi will also meet with Ecuadorian President of the National Assembly Gabriela Rivadeneira, Wang said.

Ecuador hopes President Xi's ""historic"" visit leads to strengthening strategic ties, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Guillaume Long told Xinhua ahead of the visit, adding that ""the ties with China in recent years have been very fruitful, very significant.""

Since President Correa came to power in 2007, Ecuador has focused on deepening ties with China. The Ecuadorian president's first official trip to Beijing took place in the same year of his inauguration, to bolster cooperation with China in different fields, from energy, science and technology, to economy, trade and education.

In 2015, during his second China visit, Correa and Xi agreed to elevate bilateral ties to the level of a strategic partnership.

In Quito, the two presidents are expected to blueprint the future of bilateral relations and work to further promote the strategic partnership.

""China views and grows its relations with Ecuador from a strategic and long-term perspective,"" President Xi said in a bylined article on Ecuador's leading newspaper El Telegrafo on Wednesday, one day before his visit.

Despite the long distance, China has become Ecuador's third largest trading partner, with two-way trade reaching 4.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2015, quadrupling in just 10 years.

And Ecuador is now a major destination for Chinese investment and financing in Latin America. Chinese investment and financing in Ecuador has exceeded 10 billion dollars, supporting hundreds of projects including major infrastructure projects such as the Coca Codo Sinclair hydropower plant, seven other hydropower plants and a dozen of highways.

The jet crashed during a training mission as it approached the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov for a landing due to technical failure, the ministry said in a statement.

The ministry did not specify when the accident took place, while some media reports said it happened on Sunday.

The pilot has successfully ejected and his life is not in danger, the ministry added.

As Russia's sole aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov has been sent to reinforce the Russian naval group operating in the Mediterranean with the aim of aiding the anti-terrorist mission in Syria.

Giant panda Youyou gave birth to her twin babies at Shanghai Wild Animal Park a month ago. The panda cubs are now under 24/7 care in incubators. Zoo keepers act as their mom and take care of them by ""breastfeeding"" them manually. 

In the wild and in zoos around the world a giant panda mother will give birth to twins about 50 percent of the time. Panda twins born in the wild will suffer a grim fate. The mother will determine which of the cubs is healthiest and devote her time and energy to it, abandoning the weaker of the twins. A giant panda also gestates for between just three and five months, giving birth to some of the most extremely premature babies in the animal kingdom. Newborn giant pandas are about the size of a stick of butter and way merely 1/900th of their mother's weight. Blind and hairless, they are unable to move on their own until about 80 days old.
As such, a newborn panda will need round-the-clock attention from the mother. The cub will need to be fed as many as 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. It is believed that the mother is unable to produce enough milk to sustain two cubs at once. Also, because the cub is completely dependent on the mother, handling two cubs at once can also be challenging test of dexterity.

188625661189259_1325299904188490,"Space Journal: I have finally learned to run

ABOARD TIANGONG-2 - Today is November 7, my 20th day aboard #Tiangong2. Many wonder how brother Jing and I exercise, and how different it feels compared with exercising on Earth. Yesterday, we mainly did cable exercise as strength training. We do it every other day.

We have to move some things to the return module before we start our return journey in 15 days' time, which will be physically demanding. To make matters worse, we have become less fit during the long-time flight. So we need to muscle up.

Our cable equipment is essentially a rubber band. I adjusted it into a loop hovering in mid-air, and tried a new feat I created to go through it. But I failed halfway with it stuck around my body. Meanwhile, brother Jing has increased his exercise load and even made up a new training method for his legs.

Yesterday after supper, we donned our penguin space suits and walked for about three hours and ten minutes. Staff back on Earth insist we wear them while doing exercise, as it helps maintain our muscle and body functions in a weightless environment.

Today, we focused on cycling. Since there's only one bike, we have to alternate, with the other person doing cable exercise. Usually we do it for half an hour. It is kind of tiring, and one cannot use one's strength as easily as on Earth; it feels like riding a bike in bed. However, I felt great after the morning's exercise.

And then there's running -- the first time for Chinese to run in space!

Actually, we couldn't even adjust ourselves to a full running posture for the first two days. Brother Jing finally got the hang of it on the third day, and he was so excited that he ran for an hour and established contact with Earth just to tell them. Our recommended running duration is only half an hour.

Meanwhile, some stunts are a piece of cake in space, like somersaults and floating, and some muscles that are rarely used on Earth are key here. For example, the upper arms are crucial for moving since we need to grasp things and pull ourselves along.

China expects great outcomes with the further development of its domestically developed Caihong series drones, Global Times reported.
The CH-5, China's latest drone, is able to carry an airborne early warning system to act as a platform for regional surveillance, as well as battlefield command and control, said Shi Wen, chief drone designer at the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics in Beijing.
The CH-5 can carry up to 1,000 kilograms of equipment and weapons. It will carry 16 air-to-surface missiles when displayed at an upcoming air show, but its largest capacity is 24 missiles in a single flight, engineers at the academy said.
Compared with the United States' General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, a hunter-killer drone often deemed by Western analysts as the best of its kind, the CH-5 ""can perform whatever operations the MQ-9 Reaper can, and is even better than the U.S. device when it comes to flight duration and operational efficiency,"" Shi said.
Twice as big as its predecessors in the Caihong family, the newest drone can stay in the air for about 60 hours and operate at an altitude of up to 10 kilometers. Its current maximum range is 6,500 kilometers, and a future upgrade will enable it to fly as far as 10,000, Shi added. He said designers plan to develop a CH-5 that will be capable of staying in the air for up to 120 hours, with a 20,000-kilometer range.
Moreover, the CH-5 is able to carry an airborne early warning system and electronic warfare instruments to collect electronic intelligence.

A tourist sneaked into a panda house in Nanchang Zoo in southeast China's Jiangxi province on October 27, 2016, was seen ""wrestling"" with the owner of the house for some five minutes before he finally managed to escape. 
 
The man was reportedly having a tour in the zoo with two female companions before making an attempt to climb into the panda house to tease the sleeping panda. He did manage to wake the panda. The disturbed panda was then seen on surveillance footage hugging the man's leg before sitting on him. The man was enveloped in panda's ""hug"" for around five minutes and stuck. Only when the panda rolled over its body could the man ran off. 
 
The man, surnamed Chen, said afterwards that he was trying to show off to his female ""friends"" by teasing the panda. Chen later underwent a medical check and was found unharmed.

 An environmental protection project in Tibet is taking shape, and beginning to bring about improvements, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) announced Wednesday.

""Tibet has one of the best quality environments in the world,"" said Wang Haizhou, vice chairman of Tibet autonomous regional government.

The State Council in 2009 approved the ""Plan for Ecology Safety Barrier Protection and Construction in Tibet (2008-2030),"" to further improve the environment in this southwestern region.

To evaluate the implementation of the plan, CAS issued an assessment report Wednesday on the progress achieved between 2008 and 2014.

According to the report, the plateau environmental system in Tibet is generally stable and the vegetation coverage has been on the rise.

Areas suffering from desertification have decreased by 107,100 hectares.

Measures to return grazing land to grassland have also been lauded and have had the upshot of increasing the incomes of farmers and herdsmen.

There has been a significant rise in the use of clean energy to support farming and breeding while the lives of farmers and herdsmen have considerably improved. The usage of new clean energy has reached 65.6 percent, mitigating damage to forest and grasslands.

Tibet's nature reserve area now covers 413,700 square kilometers. The area of wetlands under protection is now 4.31 million hectares, or 65.98 percent of all wetland in Tibet. Rare animals and plants are also being effectively protected, the report said.

""The quality of the water, air, soil and environment atop of the Tibet Plateau remains in good condition,"" Wang said.

Wang added that the water quality of many main rivers and lakes, such as the Yarlung Zangbo River and Namtso Lake, are at Grade I or Grade II, the top two water quality levels.

The air quality in major cities and towns is mostly good, and most of the forests, grasslands, wetlands and wildlife across Tibet are still pristine, Wang said.

According to CAS vice president Zhang Yaping, for the project CAS researchers took three years, inspected over 10 major zones, collected about 1,300 samples from three different areas and 20 monitoring sites and reached the conclusions stated in the report.

CAS also analyzed remote sensing data in three periods since 1990 and studied environmental changes in Tibet over the past 20 years.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1311792678872546/?type=3,2016-10-26 16:05:00,3048,32,421,2992,29,23,3,0,1

188625661189259_1280611958657285,"Commentary: Kindness recorded in #Chinese reality show gives us confidence in human nature 

A warmhearted video recently went viral. It was shared by users and ranked top on websites, receiving more than 75 million hits on #Weibo. Countless users were moved and excited by the kindness of ordinary people.

Guangdong Television's reality show program ""What would you do"" is a test of good, and that test came to the city of Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan province recently. An actor played a lost elderly man and people's reactions were captured. Watching the true nature of ordinary people faced with a realistic situation gave many a feeling of warmness.

In the video, a fast-food shop and a roadside stall smile generously after the elderly man left without paying. Strangers help the elderly man carry his food basket. The owner of a hotel holds the elderly man tightly as he enters, and carries his steaming hot food. Two girls from an open-air food stall help the elderly man sit down and then help him order bread. A mother who picks up her child from school lets her child hold the elderly man's hand. A few young people change their plans to help the elderly man home. On whether the future world will be okay, these ordinary people answer this question in the affirmative.

In the interviews following the acts, these good people from Sichuan did not provide grand reasons for their actions. Instead, they talked about their everyday experiences or ordinary insights on aging. Perhaps this tells us that good deeds do not need a reason. Good deeds are maybe just ordinary people following their hearts, and there is nothing more to say.

 These kind people allow us to see that good has been here all long, it never left. In everyday life we often lose hope because of so-called bad news. The breakdown of a famous marriage creates a carnival of public opinion and morality and even the law is undermined by the absurd drama. Mentors snub wisdom and act out of self-interest, and quarrels have become public events. Some people overtake other vehicles to square off, turn a blind eye to an injured child, or run illegal businesses and engage in deceptive trading. Judgments including ""morality is on the decline"" and ""humanity's hearth as changed"" do not describe the warm scenes recorded in the streets of Chengdu. In contrast, they show humanity's good side.

This is a program of reflection. Do we believe that morality has depreciated and that good deeds have gone bankrupt, thus giving us reason to turn our backs? Have we lost faith in human nature because of indifference and sullenness, thus becoming resentful and overly defensive? Have we become silent observers rather than active participants in society because of constant hesitation and delay? Perhaps we really do need to have a little more confidence in ourselves, in others, and in our society. We really should learn from the enthusiastic people on the streets of Chengdu, and not forget about what is good because of what is ugly.

Kindness and good deeds by ordinary people is society's most precious resource. We can ask what happened to our society, but we cannot help but see that society still has a lot of good in it and a lot of beauty that cannot be ignored or forgotten. Because of this, there is a growing upward force that is quietly growing.

The Chinese and Russian navies staged a mission to seize an island on Sunday as part of an eight-day exercise in the #SouthChinaSea.

As the key element of the annual drill, the navies dispatched warships, marine forces, helicopters and amphibious armored equipment for the mission.

The exercise demonstrated the Chinese and Russian navies' capacities in command management, telecommunications coordination, and intelligence and information sharing, said Senior Captain Li Xiangdong, who commanded the Chinese warships.

The mission marked the end of the China-Russia Joint Sea 2016 drill, which started on Sept 12 in eastern waters off Zhanjiang, the southernmost city in Guangdong province and the base of the Nanhai Fleet. A closing ceremony was to be held on Monday.

Compared with previous years, the 2016 drill focused more on confrontational capacity such as surface warships, submarines and land-based defenses, Li said, adding that the use of an advanced command system made communication between the two navies smoother.

It was also the first time the China-Russia joint exercise had been held in the South China Sea.

188625661189259_1268840793167735,"Op-ed: Fraternities, Face, and Fatalities: A Closer Look into Chinese Drinking Culture 

Earlier this week, a 28-year-old bridesmaid in Wenchang, Hainan province, passed out from alcohol and subsequently died from choking on her own vomit. Her tragic death has since sparked public debate over the pressure to drink at Chinese social occasions.
Hinews.cn conducted a poll that found nearly 80% of Chinese people had experienced quanjiu, the word used to describe being forced to drink at social occasions. This includes dinners, birthdays, weddings, etc. The poll also found that most hated quanjiu culture and found it to be inhuman. However, others noted that the deceased woman was an adult responsible for making her own decisions.
Though nothing is completely black and white, I can say from experience that China's drinking culture needs an update. Drinking is enforced through the social concept of face, which can be seen through cheers-ing and playing drinking games. In fact, the rules of drinking games typically force the loser to consume shockingly large amounts of hard liquor.
The social consequence is Chinese people, especially outside of Shanghai or Beijing, lack a concept of ""casual drinking."" Instead, their view of drinking doesn't fall too far from that seen in the video of the bridesmaid, as she's repeatedly pressured into gulping down booze.
It's like rushing a frat, except all the brothers are overly zealous Chinese guys that through seven glasses of baijiu, or rice wine, find the confidence to peeve you about western women's voluptuous figures. And instead of getting the chance to pledge, you are awarded face. Face is a gift given to those able to drink buckets of liquor, then hold their liquor, all while successfully navigating the obstacle course of Chinese social do's and don't's. Face the heart pumping liquor into Chinese drinking culture.
It's very confusing. As an American who's spent several years studying and working in China, my dinners with colleagues were a harrowing test of both my drinking and social abilities. It requires knowing one's place. Any foreigner will immediately notice the clearly structured class system within a typical dinner.
Lower level employees will cheers their superiors from a standing position, usually with two hands on the glass. The superior doesn't necessarily have to finish, but the initiator absolutely must. Clinking glasses means both will dry their cup, proclaimed through the Chinese equivalent of cheers-ganbei. During the cheers, the lower ranking employee must ensure the top of his or her glass is slightly below that of the partner's.
And everyone gets drunk. Drunker than you'll ever get, or should ever get, at a company social event in the West. In fact, it's expected, even appreciated.
But the issue remains in how important face is to a typical Chinese person. Letting your guard down via alcohol is a way of giving face to your employees. It's a step in the process of bringing everyone closer together.
As many Chinese netizens noted, the 28-year-old bridesmaid was simply acting in accordance to these social norms. She is giving into pressure because it's a way of giving her dear friend, the bride, face. If she were to refuse, it would create a socially awkward environment. This obviously sounds silly in hindsight, but face is such a deeply entrenched part of Chinese social interaction that only the youth have begun to reject it.
Coming back to the fraternity metaphor, a concept like face creates an environment in which going against the tide is nearly impossible. The death of this woman is no different from the countless deaths that occur every year as a result of rigorous pledging. And just as that part of American culture is beginning to change, so too must the presence of face in Chinese drinking.

Zhou Jianping, chief engineer of China's manned space program, explained in an interview that the Tiangong-2 will be used as an experimental spacecraft. Onboard, the program plans on conducting various experiments as a part of China's expansion into space. Zhou noted that according to China's three-step approach, they hope to have a manned space station in space around 2020.

Once a distant dream, the program is taking measures to make this a reality, one step at a time.

The recently launched spacecraft Tiangong-2 will use its laboratory to verify and improve upon essential technology. This includes loading and unloading cargo, inspecting an astronaut midway through his or her journey, and refueling. Zhou also noted that the station's lab will conduct advanced medical and physical experiments on board.

When asked how the first Tiangong spacecraft differs from the second, Zhou emphasized that although the general structure is similar, the innards are much different. For example, the Tiangong 2 can support two astronauts for 30 days, as well as provide larger amounts of fuel to their ships.

He went on to say that despite facing technological challenges, Zhou hopes that as long as Tiangong-2 is able to complete its laboratory objectives by next year, then China will enter the next stage in space: building a manned space station.

""The plan is that in 2018, we'll launch the space station's core."" The space station has three sections: the core part and two experimental parts. It will be capable of connecting two manned spacecraft and one transportation spacecraft. A team of three astronauts will be deployed and be based in the station. Although the space station's capacity is not as big as the international ones, Zhou said there is ample room for improvement and enhancement due to China's advanced technology. Moreover, Zhou sees the potential for the station's expansion, depending on the international cooperation as well as all the scientific studies. 

When asked about the project of Mars exploration, Zhou said that the plan remains at an early stage at this moment due to various technical challenges. One goal that's closer to achievement is sending man to the moon, Zhou added. 

""It is a goal that we must first achieve prior to exploring Mars,"" he said.

She was responding to the report of American bombers flying over Korean Pennisula.
According to the media report, American B1-B Bombers flew near North Korea on Tuesday. The move is seen as a sign of military strength aimed towards North Korea as tensions rise on the peninsula.
A situation in which tensions escalate and those involved enter a vicious circle is not favorable to any party, said Hua.

CD Rev, a rap group from Chengdu, Sichuan province, is expected to release a new single, This Is Our Generation, in October, a sign of the rising popularity of using rap to explain China to the outside world.

The group's earlier song, This Is China, became an online sensation after it was released in June.

This is China, in which group members talk about why they love the country, has been viewed more than 10 million times. The four-member hip-pop group also has about 100,000 followers on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like social platform.

""Regardless of all the prejudice in the past, today I wanna restore the impression you have on my country, China."" So begins This Is China, which touches on issues that China faces, such as air pollution, food safety and corruption, and declares: ""We love the country. ...The red dragon ain't no evil, but a peaceful place"".

Some viewers have commented on how they are impressed by the group's musical talent. Others say it is laudable that the group speaks the truth about the country's problems while remaining patriotic.

For the upcoming single, CD Rev has gathered six additional rappers, representing six Chinese cities, to spotlight the country's youth.

""Our goal is not to become big stars or celebrities. What we want is to set good examples of the post-1990 generation, members of which will become China's driving force,"" Wang Zixin, the band's 23-year-old singer-songwriter, told China Daily over the weekend.

Hip-hop bands such as Dragon King, a Beijing-based trio, will perform on CD Rev's This Is Our Generation.

""We didn't expect all the attention. We joked that if we could predict the popularity, we would have shown our faces clearly in the video,"" said Wang of This Is China, in which he and his fellow rappers appear with their faces painted in the styleof Peking Opera masks.

""We love the country and we want to make a change,"" Wang said.

Li Yijie, another CD Rev rapper, who graduated as an English major from Sichuan Normal University, wrote the lyrics in English because the band wanted to directly communicate with foreign audiences in the four-minute song.

CD Rev uses rap to show the world the real China, Li said. The band wants to deliver more than patriotic songs, hoping to reflect youths' attitude toward social issues.

Other than This is China, the group has released a dozen songs since its inception in 2015. Wang, who graduated from Sichuan University of Media and Communication, had the idea of founding the rap group with like-minded friends, all of whom are in their early 20s.

""How we look at the world and what we think in a positive way shows in our rap,"" Wang said.

""Rap can be so cool, even when it's about a serious issue,"" he said, adding that he listens to Western rappers such as Jay-Z and 2 Chainz.

With the exposure to Western culture, young people in China have in recent years used rap as a way to express individuality and identity.

""Instead of using explicit lyrics, young Chinese rappers write in a unique style, telling stories about their daily lives,"" said Li Haiqin, founder of Hip-Hop Fusion, an organization based in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, that promotes Chinese hip-hop. http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0913/c90000-9114555.html",,video,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/videos/1265298546855293/,2016-09-13 04:40:00,519,10,112,503,7,9,0,0,0

""Once the Tianhe Project is completed, it will be possible to transfer water in the air via an 'air corridor.' [The corridor] will be formed as part of the South-to-North Water Diversion project,"" said Wang Guangqian, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and president of Qinghai University. Wang introduced his proposal at a meeting on Sept. 9, which aimed to jumpstart the novel project.
According to the project's description, the atmospheric boundary layer and the troposphere form a passage through which water vapor can be transported in a stable and orderly way. The passage can be regarded as ""tianhe"" (literally, a river in the sky). The proposed undertaking has therefore been named ""Tianhe Project.""
""We monitor the content and migration routes of water vapor, and then we conduct interference in certain regions to solve water shortages in northern China,"" Wang explained.
According to the UN World Water Development Report, northern China will face a severe water shortage by 2025. The established eastern and middle routes of the South-to-North Water Diversion project, which began in 2002, have relieved that ""thirst"" to some degree. However, the western route is still a work in progress due to high altitude, complex terrain and fragile ecosystems. The air corridor proposition may offer an innovative solution to those challenges.

More humane slaughtering practices are making their way to #China, where Shandong province just saw its first standard issued for the humane slaughter of chickens. According to the standard, slaughterhouses must avoid frightening or upsetting the poultry before they are dispatched for slaughter.
Compiled by the College of Food Science and Engineering at Qingdao Agricultural University (QAU), the standard has been approved and issued by the local quality supervision, inspection and quarantine administration. It has clear requirements regarding living conditions and treatment for chickens, such as banning any violence during transportation. For example, chickens are not permitted to be dragged by one wing or leg during transportation, and transportation cannot last more than three hours.
Before a chicken is killed, it must also be outfitted with a soothing pad on its chest to calm it down, and it must be killed only after losing consciousness through gas inhalation or other methods, reported Qilu Evening News.
According to Professor Sun Jingxin from QAU, the humane slaughter of livestock goes beyond animal welfare, though animal rights are a rising topic of discussion in China. Sun said that such measures have also proven effective at improving meat quality, the newspaper added.
Shandong is the biggest chicken breeding provincial region in China, providing some 20 percent of the country's chickens. However, the previous lack of humane slaughtering methods has been an obstacle for Shandong chickens and other agricultural products to be sent overseas, as the birds bear physical signs of their violent deaths even after processing. Many chickens wind up with broken wings and bruises, Sun noted.
As early as 2007, Henan province launched China's first humane slaughter pilot project, requiring that pigs be rendered unconscious with an electric shock before being killed. The Henan project also mandated that live pigs be spared from watching the slaughter of other pigs, news site Guancha reported.

""The G20 #Hangzhou Summit will be world event of the highest importance. It comes at the time of continuous economic and financial crises in major parts of the world, including destabilization of EU after ""#Brexit"" . Therefore, the G20 summit offers rare opportunity to consider economic and security problems being interconnected,"" said Zivadin Jovanovic of the Belgrade Forum for a World of Equals, when speaking about this year's G20 summit.
Zivadin Jovanovic said that it is true that the world is still far from solution to one of the most serious economic crisis since the one that preceded the Second World War. This one is multidimensional crisis. At the same time it is economic, financial, political, security and social. Therefore, the approach to solutions has to be multidimensional. We all should be aware that development and prosperity need stability and true partnership.
""It is high time to understand and accept that the policy of domination, confrontation and militarization has no future. The stable and prosperous future can be built only on multipolarity, shared responsibility and sovereign equality of all nations, without anybody`s domination. This spirit of G20 has to be strengthened at the forthcoming Summit. Other approaches lead to confrontation and conflicts, ultimately, to self-destruction. In order to ease economic, political and social tensions and confrontations, the world needs truly sustainable development strategy, win-win cooperation and solution of major crises by peaceful political means，"" Zivadin Jovanovic said.
""G20 Hangzhou Summit is recognition to China's unprecedented economic, ethnological and innovative achievements, to Chinese contribution to the development of the underdeveloped world and to the role of China in containment of the world economic and financial crisis. At the same time, it is recognition that Asia is the center of economic and technological development of the world in 21st Century.
"" I expect that forthcoming G20 Summit will adopt more realistic approach to the world economic and financial situation of today. Deep, systematic, accumulated problems certainly cannot be resolved by mere printing of new trillions of dollars or Euros, nor by the continuous egoism and transfer of one's problems to the others but by removing of all politically motivated barriers, by openness and acceptance of shared responsibilities for common destiny.

Between a previous miscarriage and the discovery of a malignant tumor in her kidney, one Chinese woman in northwestern China's #Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region encountered more than her fair share of bad luck over the past few years. However, in the end, her story is a heart-warming one.
According to a report by thepaper.cn, the woman was found to have a malignant tumor in her kidney during her fourth month of pregnancy in December 2015. She headed to Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital for treatment, only to be warned that pregnancy leads to higher hormone levels, which would cause the tumor grow larger at a more rapid speed.
As is the common practice for those diagnosed with cancer within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, the woman's doctor suggested that she abort the baby. However, after already having been through a miscarriage of twins, the mom-to-be insisted on continuing the pregnancy.
By the late stages of her pregnancy, the tumor had grown to be 30 centimeters in diameter at its widest part, pressing against the woman's pelvis, pancreas and spleen and causing her severe pain. As the tumor kept growing, the woman was forced to schedule an earlier delivery through a Caesarean section in the 34th week of her pregnancy. Fortunately, the operation went smoothly and she delivered a healthy baby.
Just two weeks after giving birth, the new mother returned to the hospital for a surgery to remove the tumor at Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital. She had the operation on Aug. 17. Despite being somewhat unstable hormonally and in a weak condition from the birth, the operation was successful. The woman is currently in a stable condition. (file photo)

We have received strong leadership from the taskforce chair, as well as support from dedicated #Sinomach, #Sinopec, #SPIC and State Grid working teams,"" Bürkner said, when speaking about the role of Chinese companies in developing the B20 Infrastructure taskforce's policy recommendations.

""As China plays an increasingly important role in the global economy, we believe the increasing involvement of Chinese companies is an important trend for the future in infrastructure and other topics,"" he added.

Bürkner stressed the importance of five recommendations put forward by the taskforce, saying that the recommendations ""reinforce the fundamentally critical 'evergreen' B20 actions from previous years,"" and ""identify new opportunities.""

""In The Mood for Love,"" directed by #HongKong director Wong Kar-Wai in 2000, earned second place on a #BBC list of the 100 best movies of the 21st century. Two films by Academy Award-winning Taiwanese director Ang Lee, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000) and ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), ranked 35th and 40th respectively.

The list was compiled based on surveys from 177 film critics from every continent except Antarctica. Some contributors are newspaper or magazine reviewers, while others write primarily for websites. Academics and cinema curators were well-represented, too, according to the BBC.

Other Asian films on the list include the 2001 Japanese anime fantasy film ""Spirited Away,"" written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, which ranked fourth; Oldboy (2003) by Korean director Park Chan-wook, which ranked 30th; and ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter…and Spring"" (2003) by Korean director Kim Ki-duk, which ranked 66th. http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0824/c90000-9104813.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1236321879752960/?type=3,2016-08-24 06:06:00,1941,7,22,1928,11,1,1,0,0

After an effective ground-based training, a new batch of pilots has just received aircraft carrier flight certification. In order to earn the certification, these pilots successfully drove J-15 shipborne fighter planes to carry out interrupted carrier landings, and also managed ski-jump take-offs using the Liaoning aircraft carrier. The updated training system has noticeably shifted away from army-civilian cooperation and toward autonomous training conducted by the navy.

One of the pilots, Zhang Chao, sacrificed his life when practicing the carrier landing during training this April. After Zhang's death, the rest of the pilots pledged to work even harder in Zhang's honor. Within a relatively short period of time, they made the transition from ordinary pilots to shipborne fighter plane pilots. 

The training of shipborne fighter plane pilots is a brand new endeavor that comes with inherent difficulties. Forced to contend with great risks and heavy tasks, the officers and soldiers of the aircraft carrier force must meet extremely high standards. Adhering to the strict discipline and scientific design of the training process is the only realistic path to success. 

A maritime training session was held recently on the Liaoning. The session fully demonstrated the pilots' technical and tactical skills, in addition to testing their organization and command of the aircraft carrier. http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0823/c98649-9104203.html",,video,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/videos/1236087586443056/,2016-08-23 20:19:00,3501,39,460,3410,35,49,4,2,1

Shortly after, a colleague comment on the likeness - and just two weeks later, a friend sent him a link to apply for a competition to find the worlds best Vincent Van Gogh lookalike. Now, Steve has made it down to the final 30 out of nearly 1,000 entrants - and if he wins, he will get 5,000 euros and have a bronze sculpture of his head made.

188625661189259_1218887994829682,"Editorial: #China will never compromise its security interests in #THAAD deployment

Deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in #SouthKorea will pose a serious threat to China's strategic security, and China will by no means compromise such interests, read an editorial published in the People's Daily on Wednesday.

The commentary, under the byline of Zhongsheng, comes as South Korea commits to the plan despite public outcry.

The following is the translation of the article:

As tensions mount in the Korean peninsula, it is irreproachable that South Korea wants to pursue a stronger sense of security. However, things will be different if its policy negatively affects the regional strategic balance and undermines the security interests of other countries.

South Korea must bear in mind that state-to-state relationships are by no means a game, especially when it comes to security issues involving core national interests.

Experts expects THAAD to raise regional tensions rather than deter the #DPRK's nuclear and missile threats, which the South Korean government cited as a main reason for the THAAD deployment on its territory. With the THAAD deployment, South Korea now enters the #US missile defense network, which would harm the geopolitical balance in the region and provoke strategic change from #China and #Russia.

A Russian newspaper pointed out that the US is trying to excuse its long-term presence around China and Russia under the pretext of the North Korean nuclear issue.

Though South Korean decision-makers are fully aware of the hidden motives of the US, they are stiff-necked in binding its destiny with the THAAD despite public opposition.

But Seoul may not able to afford the domino effect brought by its decision, as the price will be regional stability and the security interests of its neighbors.

The Korean Peninsula issue may finally encounter a dead end and nobody will be able to guarantee absolute peace on the powder keg. Amid such severe circumstances, the policy makers of South Korea should double their prudence to avoid the worst possibility. 

The rushed and risky decision made by Seoul and Washington have crossed the security bottom line drawn by the South Korean public. A poll released on Monday showed that public support for South Korean President Park Geun-hye has dropped. Some 60.7 percent view her governance negatively, and her support among those around 20 years old was below 10 percent.

At the same time, the South Korean public staged protests against the government's surrendering of its national interests, and the opposition party has urged the government to rescind its decision on the THAAD deployment.

As a matter of fact, the US and South Korea once promised to negotiate with China on the deployment of the THAAD system, but later turned hostile and announced the rushed decision. However, their plans to strengthen defensive capabilities at the cost of other countries' security would be a one-sided calculation.

During the 4thChina-Russia consultations on Northeast Asian security on July 28, diplomats of the two countries expressed serious concern over the THAAD deployment, agreeing to safeguard the interests of both countries in most reliable and effective ways. The two comprehensive strategic partners also agreed to highlight their strategic security interests.

Analysts stressed that deploying missile defense systems may fuel a dangerous arms race in Northeast Asia, as China and Russia would probably take counter-measures that the US and South Korea cannot afford.

According to the experts, the THAAD deployment will bring nothing good to Seoul, but trap the country in a military confrontation between the three powers. Once a conflict breaks out, South Korea will inevitably be the first target.

China is and will always be committed to building amicable partnerships with its neighbors, but such amicability must be based on a premise that other countries also take a peaceful development path like China.

As the THAAD deployment in South Korea will certainly impose a serious threat to China's strategic security, China will by no means stay indifferent and compromise its security interests.

No one can underestimate China's resolution and strength to safeguard its national security as it never fears external threats. http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0804/c98649-9095345.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1218887994829682/?type=3,2016-08-04 01:15:00,1878,42,99,1848,5,19,1,1,4

188625661189259_1216951928356622,"Editorial: #THAAD deployment puts #SouthKorea at risk

South Korea will become a puppet of US policy in Northeast Asia if it finally deploys the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system on its soil, the People's Daily warned in an editorial published on Monday, urging Seoul to think twice.

Seoul will be a frontline of the #US missile defense system after it takes over the hot potato, the article emphasized, comparing such acts as drawing fire against itself.

The editorial, published under the pen name Zhong Sheng, comes as #Seoul, despite rising dissenting voices from within and the international community, insists on the THAAD deployment's necessity at its recent national security council meetings.

The THAAD system will bring nothing to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but will only further escalate tensions by creating new conflicts, the article pointed out, adding that South Korea will also face risks in politics, economy, security, environment and society.

The paper pointed out that once a conflict breaks out, South Korea would be the direct victim and will turn its destiny around, and its people will pay the highest price for a missile defense system that is ultimately useless in their defense.

Urging South Korea to keep a clear mind on the reality and the broader world arena, the editorial reminded the country that hollow weapons like the THAAD system and the US are by no means reliable approaches to protect itself.

It further noted that peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula calls for a systematic endeavor, and the deployment of the THAAD system is indeed unwise and irresponsible. South Korea should think over the reason for China's efforts to resume the Six-Party Talks, the article said.

The article hailed the rapid development of #China-South Korea ties, but stressed at the same time that a development of bilateral ties needs more joint efforts.

With frequent high-level exchanges and a deepened strategic cooperative partnership, China has become South Korea's largest trading partner, export market and source of imports. The free trade agreement signed by both sides is reaping huge returns, and bilateral personnel exchanges have exceeded 10 million, the paper illustrated.

Warning South Korea not to repeat the fate of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, the paper said that it is not the first time the US has employed a ""puppet"" strategy.

In order to expand its hegemony, the superpower usually throws other countries or regions into disarray and then escapes unscathed, the editorial said of the hidden agenda.

For the South Korean government, deploying the THAAD system is like setting wolf to keep sheep. Such a self-destructive move will result in irreversible consequences, the article warned.

""It is hoped that South Korea could put long-term and people's interests first and bear the reality in mind,"" the article said.

China is planning to build its first domestically produced polar icebreaker.
Shanghai-based Jiangnan Shipyard Co., Ltd made the announcement Friday, saying construction will start by the end of this year.
""Xuelong"", or Dragon Snow, is currently China's largest polar icebreaker which was bought from a Ukrainian company in 1993. China refitted it into a polar research vessel. ""Xuelong"" has completed 32 expeditions in Antarctica and is now on its 7th Arctic expedition.
With a length of 122.5 meters, the new home produced vessel will be smaller than the ""Xuelong"", but with stronger icebreaking power.  The new vessel is designed to break 1.5 meter thick ice at 2 to 3 knots sailing speed.

188625661189259_1214540878597727,"Editorial: #THAAD deployment threatens peace in Northeast #Asia

By Zhao Cheng from People's Daily 

The deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system will not neutralize the threat of North Korea's nuclear weapon and missiles, but escalate the tension in the #KoreanPeninsula, damage regional strategic balance and pose serious threats to security and stability in the Northeast Asia region, People's Daily warned in an editorial under the byline of Zhongsheng published on Friday.

At the beginning of July, despite explicit opposition from #China, #Russia and other countries, the #US and #SouthKorea announced they would deploy the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.

As one of the most advanced missile defense system in the world, the THAAD system can intercept incoming short-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles flying at high altitudes even outside the atmosphere, read the commentary.

Given its nature as ""high altitude area defense"" system, employing the THAAD system to shoot down long-range and short-range missiles from North Korea is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, the article said.
""Technically speaking, should South Korea and North Korea engage in conflicts, the long-range artillery and rocket artillery of North Korea are more than enough to contain South Korea,"" read the article.

In addition, the farthest distance from the north side to the south side of the Korean Peninsula is less than 900 kilometers, leaving the THAAD system little space to display its power. Therefore, the statement that the system only aims at countering nuclear and missile threats from North Korea and not targets any third country does not hold water.

Denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula is bound up with interests of all sides as it matters not only regional peace and security, but also prosperity and development of regional countries, the editorial added.
""Any acts for private interests or provocation and any behavior that will exacerbate military confrontation, intensify military drills or deploy weapon systems beyond the actual defense needs of the peninsula will force the situation into a more vicious cycle,"" warned the People's Daily piece.

The deployment of the THAAD system will not only force North Korea to advance further with its the nuclear missile program, but imperils regional strategic balance and damage security and stability in the Northeast Asia region.

The editorial also emphasized that the Korean Peninsula will not return to tranquility because of the THAAD deployment. The security of any country should not come at the expense of others. No countries will allow others to trample its legitimate rights and national strategic security interests.

""We must take on a responsible attitude towards international relations and regional issues. Reckless behavior will pay a heavy price,"" the article advised.

188625661189259_1212913868760428,"Legal voices: Can zoo be cleared of liability in fatal tiger attack?

Chinese legal experts are voicing contradictory opinions in a heated debate over whether zoos should be held responsible when visitors ignore safety reminders. This question has arisen after a fatal tiger attack in #Beijing on July 23.

Details revealed about the tragedy

After jumping out of a car in an attempt to save her daughter from a tiger attack, a woman was mauled to death by a Siberian tiger at Badaling Wildlife World. Her daughter was severely injured, CCTV reported. The tragedy occurred in a section of the park that permits visitors to drive their own vehicles through a Siberian tiger enclosure.

Footage released by CCTV shows the first woman getting out of the passenger seat of a car and walking over to the driver's side. The driver of the car was later reported to be the woman's husband. As the driver opens his door, the woman is suddenly grabbed from behind by a tiger and forcefully dragged away. The video then shows the driver and a second woman rush to the first woman's aid before a green Jeep arrives at the scene.

The rest happened off screen, but Xinhua News Agency reported that the second woman was mauled to death as she tried to rescue her injured daughter.

The video footage also captured an agreement signed by all visitors to that section of the park, warning them to ""lock the doors and windows"" and ""never get out of the car in areas that are open to the animals."" 

The agreement states that for any injuries or damage to cars due to violations of the regulations, involved visitors should take relevent responsibilities, Xinhua reported.

According to Wang Shuqin, a spokesperson for the Yanqing Bureau of Landscaping and Forestry, the jeep that showed up in the video after the attack was a safety patrolling vehicle.

""Zookeepers in the jeep used a loudspeaker to warn the young woman not to get out as soon as they spotted her trying to exit the vehicle. She hesitated but still stepped out,"" Wang told Xinhua.

Opinions divided: Is the wildlife park responsible?

In an interview with china.com.cn, Zhu Wei, a law professor from China University of Political Science and Law, said that the zoo should not be in any way liable, and that the visitors should bear full responsibility. Zhu cited article 81 in chapter 10 of the Tort Law of the People's Republic of China, which was adopted on December 26, 2009.

The article says: ""if damage to others is caused by zoo animals, the zoo shall bear tort liability unless it can prove the fulfillment of its management responsibilities.""

A witness of the accident, surnamed Wu, said that the zoo had warning posters as well as repetitive broadcasts cautioning visitors to take proper safety measures, china.com.cn reported. The last bit of video footage indeed show a sign that read, ""cherish your life, and don't get out of the car.""

""The video shows that the woman got out despite of all kinds of written and broadcast warnings. From this perspective, the zoo fulfilled its responsibilities, and should therefore be spared liability,"" Zhu said.

However, some legal experts believe that both the victim and the zoo should shoulder some of the legal responsibility. Zhang Qihuai, a researcher at China University of Political Science and Law, said the so-called exemption agreements between the zoo and visitors were not legitimate. He cited articles 40 and 52 of China's contract law, which says: ""a contract is invalid if it excludes one party's liability for personal injury caused to the other party.""

Zhang Xinnian, a lawyer from Beijing, said that despite all the warnings, malfeasance of management played a role in the tragedy.

""In an environment filled with tigers, a regular car cannot be deemed a safe shelter. What's more, the zoo managers should have been prepared to protect visitors under any circumstances, like if a vehicle lost control and broke its windows, or if an engine broke down, or if a visitor had a medical emergency,"" Zhang said.

The zoo, which is near a famous section of the Great Wall in Beijing's Yanqing district, has had serious safety problems before. In March, a park employee was killed by an elephant. A security guard who stepped out of a patrol vehicle was killed by a tiger in 2014. In 2009, an 18-year-old was killed by a tiger in the park after he scaled a fence to enter the animals' enclosure, Xinhua reported.

The Beijing Tourism website says that the park is famous for ""raising fierce animals in large groups in open areas,"" and that it has 10,000 wild animals, including brown bears, Malayan Sun bears, leopards and wild wolves.

Xinhua reported that an investigation into the incident is underway, and that the zoo has been temporarily closed. http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0727/c98649-9091785.html",,video,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/videos/1212913868760428/,2016-07-27 03:45:00,3150,120,1528,2737,13,143,11,231,15

Tigers killed a woman and severely injured another when they left their vehicle at a wildlife park in Beijing on Saturday.

The two women were part of a four-member family group being driven through Badaling Safari World, where part of the attraction is how closely the freely roaming lions and tigers can get to the vehicles.

During the trip, one of the women opened the door to get out. A tiger rushed up and snatched her in its jaws and pulled her away. The second woman, who was later reported to be the first one's mother, got out to rescue her, but another tiger attacked and killed her. Park management rescued the first woman, who was sent to hospital and was in stable condition on Sunday.

Visitors to the park, located in the Yanqing district near the Great Wall, are permitted to drive their own vehicles through the area but are warned not to get out. The park has been ordered to temporarily close while an investigation is carried out.

In 2002, China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including the Philippines, signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), which stipulated that ""the parties concerned undertake to resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned.""
Whomersley argued that ""there is a strong case for saying that the Philippines was estopped from ignoring the declaration and proceeding to the institution of legal proceedings.""
Tzanakopoulos, in his paper, observed that ""the relevant provision therein regarding resolution of disputes by negotiation was drafted in clearly binding terms, stating that the parties 'undertake' to resolve disputes through friendly consultations.""
The South China Sea disputes involve many of the littoral states, and any determination by the tribunal may have the effect of rendering states other than the Philippines and China the ""indispensable third parties,"" Tzanakopoulos wrote in his paper.
He argued that ""the South China Sea disputes, as multilateral disputes, are not fit for determination in the context of a bilateral, adversarial proceeding between only two of the many disputing states.""
Whomersley, in his paper, also pointed to the potential damage to international relations by an unconvincing decision of the tribunal.
He warned ""it is potentially destabilizing to the general course of international business that the Tribunal accepted that the Philippines could resile from the undertakings in a formal document like the Declaration (DOC).""
Tzanakopoulos also warned in his paper: ""The complex and multilateral nature of the relevant disputes"" in the South China Sea could lead to ""a rather hard case"" for the arbitration system.
""Hard cases make bad law, and it may be that the Annex VII Tribunal in the Philippines-China dispute has not taken this fully under advisement,"" he explained.
The scholar suggested that the best solution to these complex disputes is putting aside disputes and engaging in joint exploitation of the territory in the South China Sea, put forward by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping decades ago.
""Perhaps zones of cooperation will do much to allow the littoral states to enjoy the benefits of the South China Sea without all the fallout that adjudication inevitably produces in the face of strong objections,"" he concluded in his paper.

China's first high orbit remote sensing satellite, Gaofen-4, went into use after six months of in-orbit testing, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) announced Monday.

Gaofen-4 is China's first geosynchronous orbit high-definition optical imaging satellite and the world's most sophisticated.

Unlike from Gaofen-1 and Gaofen-2 in low orbits around the earth, Gaofen-4 is orbiting at 36,000 kilometers. High orbit satellites have the advantage of being able to snap ""grand scenarios."" Low orbit satellites, in contrast, can see more detail at faster speed.

Low orbit satellites cannot always follow natural disasters, but Gaofen-4 can continuously observe a disaster because it moves synchronously with the earth. It improves the response to disasters like earthquakes, landslides and typhoons with its high-precision sensors.

Gaofen-4, which was launched in December 2015, has a designed lifespan of eight years, compared to other remote sensing satellites which remain in service for less than three to five years.

During the in-orbit test, Gaofen-4 has been used to collect imageries of flood-hit areas in south China and monitor fires that occurred in southwest China's Sichuan Province and in Russia.

China started the Gaofen project with the launch of Gaofen-1 in April 2013. It aims to launch seven high-definition observation satellites before 2020, designed for disaster prevention, surveillance of geological disasters and forest disasters and weather forecast.

Gaofen-3 is set to be launched in August 2016, according to the SASTIND.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1181527071899108/?type=3,2016-06-13 15:04:00,5152,44,146,5080,15,51,3,2,1

""We will not only listen to what she says, but also see what she will do,"" said the People's Daily in a commentary to be carried in its Saturday edition.

The commentary came after Taiwan's new leader, Tsai Ing-wen, took office on Friday morning.

The People's Daily asked whether she will bring cross-Strait ties closer, or push the two sides further apart, and whether she will follow the correct path of peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, or push for ""Taiwan independence"" while claiming to ""maintain the status quo.""

A choice of different paths leads to different futures, and this choice involves the direct interests of the people on both sides of the Strait and the peace and stability of the region, the commentary added.

People on both sides of the Strait will wait and see how Taiwan authorities make this choice based on their actual deeds, the People's Daily said.

The commentary said although Tsai has stated she will continue to advance peaceful and stable growth of cross-Strait relations, she has deliberately avoided the core implications of the 1992 Consensus and has been ambiguous about the nature of cross-Strait relations.

On the essential question whether she will explicitly adhere to the political foundation of peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, her answer sheet was ""incomplete"", said the commentary.

188625661189259_1164996323552183,"#SouthChinaSea patrol should be a regular move, military expert says

In order to cope with U.S. reconnaissance, which poses a challenge to China's sovereignty and national security, #China should institute regular patrols in the South China Sea, said military expert Liang Fang in an interview with People's Daily Online.

According to a report on the #BBC, two Chinese fighter jets conducted an ""unsafe"" interception of U.S. aircraft EP-3 in international air space over the South China Sea. A report on Xinhua said that a U.S. EP-3 aircraft conducted a close reconnaissance mission near #Hainan Island on Tuesday.

China's Ministry of National Defense told People's Daily Online that they saw the report, and that this incident might be related to U.S. military reconnaissance around China. The ministry plans to perform an in-depth evaluation of the incident.

Liang questioned the U.S. story about China's interception in international air space, saying that aircraft from all countries are allowed to fly in international air space, and China's military aircraft have never intercepted another aircraft in international air space before.

Liang believes there is a good chance that U.S. reconnaissance aircraft were too close to China's air space, or that they perhaps entered China's exclusive economic zone, both of which could have led to China's interception.

Two Chinese fighter jets safely tracked and monitored the aircraft, said Hong Lei, a spokesperson from China's Foreign Ministry. Hong added that the Chinese jets kept a safe distance from the U.S. aircraft.

According to previous reports, U.S. Navy destroyer USS William P. Lawrence sailed in waters near islands and reefs in the South China Sea on May 10 without seeking permission from the Chinese government. In addition, USS Lassen entered waters near Zhubi Reef without the permission of the Chinese government in October 2015, and USS Curtis Wilbur sailed within 12 nautical miles of Zhongjian Island without prior notification in January 2016.

Liang said that it is more or less typical of the U.S. at this point to conduct close-in reconnaissance in the South China Sea. China will never allow the U.S. to treat the South China Sea as public waters, nor will the U.S. be allowed to deploy ships and aircraft to the area, Liang added.

In Liang's view, the U.S. treats the South China Sea as part of its rebalancing strategy in the #Asia-Pacific, and in doing so attempts to incite other countries to oppose China. Meanwhile, the U.S. wants to promote militarization in the area. To cope with these provocative actions, Liang suggested that China consider expanding patrols in the South China Sea.

A young woman in her 20s has become famous online for hugging male strangers on buses in Jinan, city in northern China's Shandong province. The male passengers told local news outlet that they were ""harassed"". And this woman, though an online hit, has yet to be identified.

A bus driver who was one of the many ""victims"" or the ""lucky ones"" told local TV station that the young woman approached him on May 15 when he was on duty.

""You did a good job, can I give you a hug?"" the woman asked.
Before the driver realized what was happening, she had already bended over and gave the driver a hug. ""I was shocked and glued to the spot for a couple of seconds,"" said the driver. He said the woman went on to ask hugging other male passengers on bus and some refused.

According to local news, similar conducts had been occurring on Jinan buses in the last couple of weeks, with many male passengers left appalled. A video allegedly taken by a passenger when one of the incidents happened shows a woman kept leaning her body onto a man, who apparently did not know her. The woman at first wobbled unsteadily next to him, before leaning her whole body onto the man and wrapping her arm around his neck. The man was captured in the video asking the woman if she's feeling unwell.

President #XiJinping stressed the irreplaceable role of philosophy and social sciences for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, urging Chinese characteristics to be incorporated in their development.

Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks in a speech delivered at a symposium on Tuesday to discuss philosophy and social sciences in China.

Xi said a country without advanced development of the natural sciences could not possibly be a leading nation, and neither can a country without booming achievements in philosophy and the social sciences.

Xi said people should recognize the irreplaceable roles played by philosophy and social sciences and the important works done by researchers in these fields.

Xi called for developing a system of philosophy and social sciences with Chinese characteristics that incorporates the country's socialist practices.

Xi noted that the current era is conducive to the development of philosophy and social sciences.

""China is undergoing the most profound and widespread social reform in its history,"" Xi said.

Such unprecedented practices will generate enormous power and broad space for developing theory, he added.

The present time requires great theory and great minds, Xi said, encouraging philosophy and social science researchers to respond to the call and pool their wisdom in the service of the Party and the people.

Liu Yunshan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, also attended the symposium.

The surveillance video shows the boy letting go of his mother's hand as they walked together on the crosswalk. The little boy then ran across the street at the very moment that a car began to turn right, knocking the boy to the ground and driving over his chest.

He was then rushed to the hospital, though he appeared to have suffered only some scratches on his forehead and several soft-tissue injuries. 

But how could such a small child be run over and suffer only minor injuries?

Currently, the right portion of the Buddha's face is dark green. Dong Dewu, a local villager, told the reporter: ""Last year, the pavilion on top of the Buddha collapsed. Since then, whenever it rains, water and leaves fall onto the face of the Buddha. Then moss began to grow on its face, and we can no longer see the Buddha's right eye.""

The Niujiaozhai Buddha is quite popular among locals. Every year, many people come to burn incense and pray. They hope that the cultural relic experts are able to repair the Buddha and ""open"" its right eye. 

According to the Cultural Relics Bureau of Renshou County, the renovation will last five years. Starting from an investigation of ecological system conditions, the experts will find the cause of the erosion and curb the water. Then they will remove the moss and renovate the weathered parts. http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0505/c98649-9053586.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1154945691223913/?type=3,2016-05-05 03:00:00,27718,69,815,27464,94,146,10,2,2

The People's Liberation Army has released a rap-style music video filled with masculine lyrics and advanced weaponry in an attempt to attract more young people to join the military.

The song, called Battle Declaration, was posted on 81.cn, the PLA Daily's website, on Thursday. It is the first hip-hop video made by the PLA.

Previous PLA songs have been sung to the accompaniment of orchestral melodies, and their lyrics were carefully worded to avoid being too aggressive. By comparison, Battle Declaration, in an unmistakable effort to cater to the taste of young people, features a popular hip-hop style, and the lyrics hide neither combativeness nor a desire to fight.

The video starts with a young PLA soldier touching his uniform and putting on his cap. Then a man's voice comes in and says, ""There are always missions in soldiers' minds, enemies in their eyes, responsibilities on their shoulders, and passions in their hearts.""

The song then continues: ""There could be a war at any time. Are you ready for that?""

The video shows soldiers training and exercising, fighter jets conducting dogfights and missiles being fired, among other military activities.

Almost all of the PLA's best weaponry is displayed in the video, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning, J-11 fighter jet, Type-99A tank and DF-11 ballistic missile.

China will soon equip firefighters with a new type of protective suit, which will be multifunctional, safe and comfortable. A reporter from Beijing Daily saw the newly developed suit in the Haidian firefighting division of Beijing on April 20.

According to an official with Beijing's fire department, advanced technologies from Chinese space suits are being applied to the design of the new firefighting suit. No wonder the new suit is so impressive!

The helmet, which resembles Iron Man's helmet, boasts various functions including a built-in phone, information collection and temperature monitoring. Under the face shield is a respirator, and the red triangle on top of the helmet functions as both a headlamp and camera. When the firefighter enters the scene of a fire, the helmet's information collection system transfers what the firefighter is seeing to the remote control station. 

The helmet is also equipped with an alarm. If the firefighter is still for 20 seconds, the helmet begins to flash red and blue lights and buzz loudly. Because the suit has a location function, backup firefighters are then able to find and rescue their endangered comrade. 

The new suit also has an automatic cooling system. A tester wore the suit in a high-temperature cabin for 30 minutes and still felt comfortable. In addition, the new suit can monitor the wearer's motion, pulse and other vital signs.

A photo went viral online in last couple of days shows beauty products scattered all around on airport floor and luggages were opened and inspected. The caption under the photo says the beauty products were the items people threw away to avoid becoming the subject of the new tax policy taking effect on Friday.

The photo was later on proved be snapped in Shanghai Pudong International Airport, and the Shanghai Customs said it was just a normal routine of checking up tourist's luggages. The luggage checked up in the photo was containing boxes of beauty products the tourists bought from South Korea. The beauty products were piled up in different categories simply for the convenience of inspection.

The circulation of the photo was triggered by a new tax bill implemented since April 8 ,2016. #China's Ministry of Finance published on Thursday a list of more than 1,100 imported items that will be subject to the new tax policy. Among them are food, baby products, home appliances, cosmetics, clothing and shoes, items that Chinese consumers tend to purchase online. The government unveiled the new tax policy last month which analysts said will increase the tax burden on low-end products while lower the tax rate for some premium items such as cosmetics.

The move is the government's latest effort to create a level playing field for online and offline sellers of imported goods, as currently retail goods purchased online are enjoying tax rates that are lower than those on other imported goods.

The tax revamp comes amid a cross-border e-commerce boom in China as the growing middle class increasingly desires products of higher quality.

The Ministry of Finance confirmed on Sunday that the current customs clearance guide of resident passengers may bring in duty-free articles for personal use worth a total of RMB 5,000 is not changed.

Some 21 people with links to a Shanghai-based investment company, Zhongjin Capital Management Co., have been detained on suspicion of illegal fundraising, the #Shanghai Police said on April 6, 2016.
An investigation was launched when several public members complained of being cheated after investing in some schemes offered by the investment company. The police did not release details of the complaints, but said in a statement that the company ""defrauded investors with non-existent programs and is involved in illegal fundraising"".
The company's office building was closed down on Tuesday, while upset investors claiming to be the victims gathered outside of the company in hope of regaining their missing money.
According to Zhongjin's website, as of February 10, 2016, the firm has raised over 34 billion yuan (more than $5.2 billion USD) from over 130,000 investors, among whom more than 20,000 investors were in their 60s. Founded in 2012, the young company was actually controlled by several youngsters under an average age of 30, based on a report from a Chinese online media jiemian.com. And the company's president Chen jiajing, director of Guotai Investment Holdings Co. and Zhongjin's major shareholder, was born in 1987. The 29-year-old woman leads the company to establish over 50 subsidiaries and have invested in over 100 partnership companies across China.
Not long before the company was shut down, a young woman who claimed to be a manager of Zhongjin posted a picture on her WeChat Moments (a Chinese social media platform), in which she held bundles of Chinese RMB, saying that she would work harder to earn more in the future. Those Chinese investors who are affected were furious over the post.

Of the whales that were killed by the four-ship fleet from Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research, 230 were female, with 90 percent of them pregnant as it is breeding time in the southern seas.

Japanese authorities claimed it was conducted as part of the efforts to understand the minke whale populations in the Antarctic Ocean so as to find the best methods for managing minke populations.

The 2015/2016 hunt came a year after an International Court of Justice 2014 ruling that challenged the scientific legitimacy of Japan's lethal research program, saying the annual hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as science.

Japan has continued to reject international orders to stop its program, alleging that its whaling activities are vital to a larger body of research, as opposed to commercial purposes.

The just-concluded expedition that started in December 2015 was only part of Japan's 12-year program that will kill 4,000 minke whales.

The conservation status of Antarctic minke whales is not clear, but studies found a 60-percent reduction in its population when comparing the 1978-91 period and the 1991-2004 period, which would qualify the species for endangered status.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1125269750858174/?type=3,2016-03-26 14:15:00,12529,322,707,11938,11,73,10,151,346

Scientists using the U.S. Kepler space telescope said Monday they have captured for the first time the brilliant flash of an exploding star's shockwave, called a ""shock breakout,"" in the visible light range.

The researchers, led by Peter Garnavich, an astrophysics professor at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, analyzed light captured by Kepler every 30 minutes over a three-year period from some 50 trillion stars.

They were hunting for signs of massive stellar death explosions known as supernovae, which begin when the internal furnace of a star runs out of nuclear fuel causing its core to collapse as gravity takes over.

During an supernovae, a supersonic shockwave is sent out from the star's core, which will then cause a bright flash of light, called a ""shock breakout,"" when it reaches the surface of the star.

188625661189259_1113383862046763,"What does the #NPC tell us about the Chinese economy?

There are lots of pessimists out there about the Chinese economy these days. Will #China experience a lost decade of zero growth like Japan did in the 90s? Or is China headed for a hard-landing altogether?

Well, people can speculate all they want based on different metrics and methodologies, but we thought it'd be helpful to look at some data, and some new policies coming out of this year's NPC, China's top legislature.

First of all, let's not forget the Chinese #economy is now growing from a much larger base. In 2005, China's GDP was just $2.3 trillion. Now it's around 10 and-a-half trillion. 11.3 percent growth in 2005 amounted to more than $255 billion . Whereas 6.9 percent growth last year amounted to $725 billion. So let's do the math. With half of 2005's growth rate, 2015 actually produced nearly three times the wealth.
Now at this year's NPC, China set its 2016 GDP target at between 6.5 percent and 7 percent. Beijing thinks that will be enough to absorb the new labor force coming into the market.
You may have noted that this is the first time China set a range not a specific number. That's expected to discourage goal-obsessed local authorities from massaging their data to meet the target.
Export is another component of China's GDP. After missing last year's trade target, this year the Chinese Premier did not even bother setting a trade target.  And many economists think that was a realistic move. After all, in an interdependent global economy it's hard enough to control one's own economy, let alone the rest of the world's.
Now the question is: how will the Chinese government respond to its slowing growth? Will there be more stimulus? The answer is yes, and no.
At this year's NPC, Beijing says it WILL use fiscal stimulus to help growth. The budget deficit will increase from 2 percent to 3 percent of the GDP. But it's a different sort of stimulus.
In the past, government spending largely went to state-financed infrastructure projects. This time, the stimulus will mainly come from a $77 billion tax cut.
So a high-tech start-up in Beijing, or an Internet company in Guangzhou, ideally, should have more money to expand and hire. A concept Beijing calls ""supply-side economics.""
On the monetary side, China will also increase money supply to 13 percent, up from 12 percent.
Of course, there needs to be government oversight to make sure
this extra cash mainly gets invested where it can do the most good—in small businesses that can create more jobs.

New audio tapes released by NASA revealed an extraordinary experience of astronauts on #Apollo10 on the dark side of the moon. Nearly 50 years after the mission, the audio captured the moment when astronauts reported hearing ""space music"".

On the far side of the moon, the astronauts were out of radio contact with the Earth and hence didn't expect to hear anything on their instruments, until two astronauts got baffled by the weird ""Whooooo, Whoooo"" sound.
Despite the eerie experience, the truth might be based on a scientific root rather than sci-fi. A NASA technician explains that the ""radios in the two spacecraft (the lunar module and the command module) were interfering with each other.""

The sounds lasted almost an hour that the capsule was on the far side of the moon, and back on Earth the recording was shelved by NASA until 2008, when it was declassified. Now it has resurfaced in the upcoming third season of Science Channel's series, NASA's Unexplained Files. Read more: http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0223/c90000-9019682.html

188625661189259_1092194767499006,"Op-ed: U.S. Senate's plaza-renaming scheme is futile

According to reports, the US Senate has unanimously approved a bill to name the street in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington ""Liu Xiaobo Plaza."" A similar bill was passed by the House of Representatives in June 2014. A White House spokesperson said senior advisers to US President Barack Obama would recommend that he veto the bill.

The bill was introduced by Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican contender for the 2016 presidential election. Sources said that Cruz ended holds on blocking Obama's nominations of two ambassadors after Democrats agreed not to oppose the plaza-naming measure.

The apparently provocative move intends to outrage and unsettle China. But this is no big deal. In addition to anger, it will enable us to learn more about the US from another perspective: the US has big problems in abiding by the rules and keeping self-respect and its Congress acts so rashly.

The US has been at its wits' end in dealing with China as it is reluctant to employ military threats or economic sanctions that may backfire. The only option for Washington seems to be petty actions that disturb China. But these can help China better understand what vile characters it will meet during its rise and face whatever awkwardness comes by dealing with them.

This latest move by Congress cannot change the fact that Liu jeopardized China's national security and was sentenced to jail. The rise of China is being confronted by external forces like the US. Whether Liu feels proud of such turbulent embraces from the West or not, he has become a tool of the West against China.

It's worth noticing that Congress, in support of Liu, has long played the harshest role in US attempts to counter China and has always guarded US national interests. The contest of national interests between China and the US is particularly prominent in the 21st century. The latest Congress move to back Liu makes more explicit the logic between Liu's deeds and the rejuvenation of China.

US senators and a few Chinese dissidents they support may think that their behavior can throw dust in the eyes of Chinese. But they may have underestimated how discerning Chinese people can be. China needs to grow more confident. China's brilliant performance in countering the West's ill-attempted moves in marketization and informatization has defined it as a resilient and dynamic country.

China's development seems to have given lots of stress to some narrow-minded US elites and prompted their gaffes. But this is not our fault. After all, what can we do when those elites want to maintain their privilege in a changing world? http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0214/c90777-9016279.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1092194767499006/?type=3,2016-02-13 21:42:00,2823,29,46,2823,0,0,0,0,0

A wild Siberian Tiger was caught in the infrared camera in Northeast Taxus Chinensis Natural Reserve Area in Heilongjiang, northeast China, the local bureau of forestry reported on January 17, 2016. This is the first time a wild Siberian tiger is clearly recorded in video.

The clip shows the tiger roamed leisurely in the land of the reserve area on January 1, 2016. Attracted by the LED indicator of the infrared camera, it pushed its face towards the lens, leaving a front portrait.

Another clip taken on January 17, 2016 caught the same tiger dragging its prey.

The three infrared cameras were installed in the reserve after a 120-kg boar was found dead in the area on December 19, 2015. Synthetic analysis showed that its predator was a male wild Siberian Tiger, 2.5 to 3 years old, who caught the boar when it was inspecting its own territory.

Wild Siberian tiger is an extremely rare species, as its population in China is estimated at merely 18-22.

A 32-year-old Polish student studying at Hohai University in east China's Nanjing got three days' detention for kicking a woman crossing street on his scooter on Dec. 28, 2015.

A shocking footage circulated on Chinese social media showing the student kicking the woman in the backside after she walked in front of his scooter. The student can be seen extending his leg and kicking the woman, who fell unceremoniously to the ground. 

As the woman struggled to pick herself and her handbag up, the biker rode off, leaving the woman's companion in his wake as he tried to run after the scooter.

The Polish student was also caught for cursing pedestrians on roads for no reason. The woman who got kicked said she hadn't received any form of apology so far.

The Ministry of Public Security has introduced 20 measures to help attract foreign high-caliber talents to Beijing, in lieu with the capital's determination to become an innovation-oriented metropolis. The 20 measures will be put into effect on March 1, 2016.
One of the most eye-catching measures is: overseas Chinese who hold a PhD degree can directly apply for permanent residence in China. It will also be applicable to those who have worked in the high-tech district #Zhongguancun, China's Silicon Valley in Beijing, for four years in a row and have lived in the country for at least six months each year.
According to the Ministry of Public Security, the new rules are catered for four types of foreign talent: top-tier talent, overseas Chinese who study abroad and come back to start up enterprises, young foreign students, and alien members in a startup team.
The said move aims to make it easier for foreigners to live in Beijing and further boost the city as a place favored innovative talent.
Some of the measures were already implemented in Shanghai last July in a pilot program, and have been proven effective.

China's largest online airline ticket booking service Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd is having trouble maintaining trust with its users because it is in a spat with many leading domestic airlines.

One user, a Beijing-based white-collar worker surnamed Huang, has used Qunar regularly over the last three years to buy tickets back to her hometown in Southwest China's Guizhou Province. 

But now, she is thinking about abandoning it.

""I lost a lot of faith in Qunar after so many major domestic airlines decided to end their relationships with the platform,"" she told the Global Times on Tuesday.

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd and Air China Ltd on Monday became the latest domestic major airlines to close their official sales channels on Qunar, joining Hainan Airlines Co Ltd, China Southern Airlines Co Ltd and Capital Airlines, which did the same on Thursday. On Tuesday, Tianjin Airlines also shut down its online flagship stores on Qunar.

The airlines stopped selling tickets through Qunar because of the numerous customer complaints they received about the service, according to their separate posts. They said many customers complained about being overcharged for buying or returning tickets from agents on the platform.

Huang hasn't had such problems with Qunar, but she is still concerned about the service.

""Now that big airlines have questioned Qunar's consumer services, I need to be careful,"" she said, noting that she decided to uninstall Qunar mobile app immediately.

In a microblog post responding to airlines' decisions on Thursday, Qunar did not acknowledge that it has problems with consumer services. Instead, it said China Southern and Hainan Airlines abandoned the platform because they couldn't agree on the way to display fares and departure times.

Qunar also said that users still can book flights on the aforementioned airlines on its platform from third-party agents, just not directly from the airlines. When contacted by the Global Times on Tuesday, Qunar declined to comment further on the matter.

Serving a warning

It's difficult to determine the real reason why the airlines abandoned Qunar, analysts said. Still, the dispute will serve as warning to other flight booking services with customer service problems.

Qunar's major rivals, Ctrip.com International Ltd and the rising star Alitrip, have similar issues such as phony promotions, bundling sales and unclear rules on how to return tickets, according to a post by Shanghai Consumer Council on December 17.

For instance, the council bought a 542 yuan ($83) flight on China Eastern Airlines from a third-party agent on Alitrip in early December.

The ticket said it could be returned according to the regulation of the airline, charging 80 percent of the ticket cost as commission, which amounts to a refund of 100 yuan. In reality, however, the council only got 50 yuan back, according to the post.

Complaints about flight bookings were up in 2015, at least in Shanghai.

The council had received 7,874 consumer complaints about airline ticket bookings from January 1 to December 15, 2015, Tang Jiansheng, the council's deputy secretary-general, said in the post. By comparison, it received 4,806 such complaints in 2014.

Wei Changren, CEO of Beijing-based Jinlü Consulting, pins the blame on some undisciplined third-party agents. ""They employ unethical practice to make extra money while offering low-priced airline tickets to price-sensitive consumers,"" he said.

""By breaking off their relationships with Qunar, the industry leader, the airlines have come up with an effective way to pressure other players to pay more attention to after-sales services and help push unqualified agents out of the market,"" he said.

China's online airline ticket booking industry was worth 80.9 billion yuan in the third quarter of 2015, up 58.6 percent year-on-year, according to a report released by market consultancy Analysys International on December 10, 2015.

Qunar led the industry with a market share of 38.2 percent, followed by Ctrip.com International Ltd with 37.7 percent and Alitrip, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding's travel service, which had 16.4 percent.

Looming changes

Wei predicted that airlines will pressure online platforms like Qunar in 2016 to raise standards for third-party agents operating on their platforms.

Air China aims to have half of its flights sold through its own marketplace by the end of 2016, Xiao Feng, Air China's chief accountant, was quoted as saying by 21st Century Business Herald newspaper in September.

Wei doesn't see that happening until at least 2017. Currently, the big airlines only sell 20 percent of total airline tickets across the country, he said.

The market will become increasingly concentrated in the coming years, so the airlines will only need one or two large, well-regulated online booking platforms, Wei said.

""Qunar will need to work out its problems with the airlines, otherwise, it might just end up forced out of the business,"" Wei noted.

The airlines' own marketplaces are gaining popularity among customers like Li Xi, who are willing to pay a little more for better customer service.

""I prefer buying tickets via Air China's official website, which not only guarantee after-sales services, but also sometimes offers lower fares than other online travel agents,"" Li told the Global Times on Monday.

Upcoming transformation

The price gap between airlines and agents has narrowed considerably since the beginning of 2015, when the major airlines began lowering commissions they paid agents. By the middle of the year, they cut the commissions to almost zero.

The change not only squeezed the profit margins of small-scale agents, but also pressured Qunar and other online platforms to change their business models, Wei said.

Ctrip has already started to diversify its business by offering travel packages that include airport pick-up services, car rentals and hotel reservations, the company said in an e-mail sent to the Global Times on Monday.

Online travel agents can no longer rely only on commissions from selling airline tickets, Ctrip said.

Alitrip is also trying to provide similar packages, according to the company. Besides, Alitrip has imposed stricter rules on the travel agents.

""Air ticket agents now can no longer get their products listed on alitrip.com by self-application. We will carry out on-the-spot investigations and invite only qualified agents to our site,"" Alitrip told the Global Times.

Wei expects Qunar will make sweeping changes in 2016, following the lead of Ctrip, which just inked share swap agreement and partnership with Qunar in October.

A bullet train set off from Haikou, the capital of the island province, at 9:40 a.m., launching operations of the 345-km western track of the loop line, which links six counties to join the eastern track in Sanya City, a beach resort on the island's southern coast.

The 308-km eastern part was put into operation at the end of 2010, linking Haikou to Sanya, with a designed speed of up to 250 km per hour. It passes Boao, a scenic town that is the site of the annual Boao Forum for Asia.

Construction of the western track began in September 2013 with an investment of 27 billion yuan (4.23 billion U.S. dollars).

Op-ed III on the Philippines' South China Sea Arbitration Farce

In midsummer 2015, the so-called South China Sea arbitration hearing that the #Philippines had been clamoring for and brewing in the past two years finally started. Recently, the relevant arbitral tribunal held this so-called hearing in The Hague, Netherlands, where the Philippine side made irresponsible and derogatory remarks in its statements on the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the #SouthChinaSea signed by relevant countries in 2002. Such remarks are indeed astonishing.
 It is well known that in the late 1960s, a report of the #UnitedNations Economic Commission for #Asia and the Far East stirred up the South China Sea. To vie for interests in oil resources, some countries laid territorial claims to #China's Nansha Islands and illegally occupied some of the islands and reefs, giving rise to the South China Sea issue. For the purpose of managing disputes among the parties and maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, China and #ASEAN countries started their communication in the 1990s to jointly explore a dispute settlement approach suitable for the region. After a long period of consultation and mutual adaptation, China and the ten ASEAN countries officially signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) in Phnom Penh, #Cambodia in 2002, which announced to the world that regional countries had an official document to follow when dealing with issues in the South China Sea. Since then, the South China Sea disputes gradually quieted down and peace and stability was maintained for over a decade. The DOC won the reputation of a ""stability anchor"". Article 4 of the DOC stipulates that, ""The Parties concerned undertake to resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned, in accordance with universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea"". With eight more years of joint efforts, China and the ten ASEAN countries reached agreement on the Guidelines for the Implementation of the DOC in 2011, and started the historical process of fully and effectively implementing the DOC.
 However, since taking office, the current government of the Philippines has drastically changed the country's constructive attitude for good faith cooperation in the past, gone back on its commitment under the DOC and trampled on the common efforts of relevant countries in safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea. It meticulously planned an ""arbitration"" farce with the instigation and support of some country outside the region in an attempt to re-create disputes in the South China Sea. At the hearing, the Philippines' counsel made unfounded statements that the DOC had never created any right or obligation and it was merely an expediency of mutual compromise, and that the path of seeking dispute settlement through friendly negotiation chosen by the parties through joint commitment was non-binding and had not achieved any anticipated result. Such statements can be traced back to the earlier ""Memorial"" filed by the Philippine side. One cannot help but ask, if a sovereign state can dishonor its commitment and willfully break its promise, if the DOC is indeed as meaningless as claimed by the Philippine side, then where does the international reputation of the Philippines, a sovereign state, rest upon? And where did the peace and stability in the South China Sea for over a decade come from?!
 What is also astonishing is that the arbitral tribunal could not tell right from wrong and followed suit by belittling the DOC, the document signed by the governments of China and the ten ASEAN countries, in its ruling on the relevant jurisdiction issue. One cannot help but ask how can the choice of dispute settlement approach made by all the people of eleven countries, or nearly one third of the world's population, be easily overturned by a word or two of the arbitral tribunal?! What's more, the relevant ruling also gives a distorted interpretation of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and arbitrarily interprets #UNCLOS' stipulation on the ""obligation to exchange views"" on disputes. That is an attempt to lower the threshold for the states parties to enter into the compulsory procedures and to pave the way for new farces planned by some countries. If the interpretation of the arbitral tribunal becomes a reality, countries will be constantly involved in various legal actions and the world will hardly have a quiet day. All little disputes between two states will inevitably lead to lawsuits. Such an act of arbitrarily expanding the power of oneself will never have the consent of sovereign states.
 The international rule of law upholding equity and justice cannot be distorted by a farce, and the DOC shall not become a scrap of paper just because of a few unfounded remarks. All parties to the DOC have the responsibility and obligation to safeguard its validity and authority, so that it can continue to play the role of a ""stability anchor"".

A section of the Sino-Laos railway (Vientiane to Boten) started construction on Wednesday. The railway, connecting Vientiane, the capital of Laos, and China's Kunming in Yunnan province, is expected to be completed in 2020.

Laos is the only landlocked country in southeast Asia. With inconvenient transport, Laos remains somewhat mysterious to the outside world. However, the situation may be changed within five years.

According to information published on the Chinese government website, the Sino-Laos railway is the first overseas railway project mainly constructed, operated and invested by China. It will be directly connected with China's domestic railway network. The construction will be done in accordance with Chinese technical standards and use China-made equipment. The total investment reaches nearly 40 billion yuan (6.25 billon USD), in which China and Laos hold a respective 7: 3 ratio of shares.

In Laos, the railway starts from border city Boten, passes through Muang Xai, Luangprabang, Vang Vieng and ends at Vientiane, covering a total length of 427.1 km. with a designed hourly speed of 160 km. Sixty percent of the railway will be built on bridges or through tunnels. 

Currently, besides flying, people can only travel from China's Kunming to Laos's Vientiane via bus. This takes a total of two days and three nights. With the Sino-Laos railway, the journey can be shortened to about 10 hours. (File pic)

China's capital city Beijing has endured the worst air pollution these days. With an orange alert, the second highest possible smog warning being issued by the National Meteorological Center, the city monitoring sites reported highest levels of pollutants on Monday.

Smog has been a major environmental problem in China for years. With an increase in awareness and the number of people affected, proposals on how to improve air quality have been a heated discussion. In 2013, the State Council issued an Action Plan on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution, which requires populated regions and metropolises at the level of PM2.5 to be sharply reduced by 2017. In 2014, the mayor of Beijing, Wang Anshun, even said he'd stake his life on it, vowing that if the air were not put under control by 2017, he would behead his head and bring it to the Central leadership. 

However, in the past year, rarely have there been blue skies in Beijing, that people made up new words such as ""APEC Blue"" and ""Military Parade Blue"" in cherishing the blue skies during APEC 2014 and the Chinese military parade in this September. The ""APEC Blue"" and ""Military Parade Blue"" show the ability and resolution of the Beijing government wanting to tackle the air pollution. But that is far from enough. 

According to the city's heavy air pollution emergency plan, motorists would be limited to driving alternate days when the city announces a red alert, the highest possible smog warning. However, during the past five days, neither a red alert nor any restrictive measures were announced. What is the point of the heavy air pollution emergency plan, if no actions is to be taken or enforced? In this battle against heavy smog, what we need the most is actions taken to solve the problem, rather than just warnings that predict the imminent problem. After all, it is the determination and actions that will lead to the most wanted clean air, not the promised ""head"".

As China is upgrading its industries, Africa can take a ride to achieve development, Abdoulaye Fall, Senegalese Ambassador to China, said in an exclusive interview with People's Daily before he left for Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (#FOCAC), calling on Africa to beef up cooperation with China.
""Driven by rising labor cost, China is transforming and upgrading its industries and putting more emphasis on advanced technologies."" Fall believed such a momentum will certainly bring infinite opportunities to Africa.
Fifteen years after African leaders gathered in Beijing to witness the onset of the first FOCAC, fruitful results have been scored. The biggest harvest of the Forum, in Fall's eyes, is embodied in enhanced mutual trust and multiple cooperation between China and Africa.
According to the ambassador, it is every African's wish to host a FOCAC summit in the continent.
""African people are looking forward to a closer all-round cooperation with China to board on the high-speed train of China's economic development."" he added.
Hailing China as a model for African countries, Fall also expressed his admiration for China to grow into the world's second largest economy.
He believed that there is a great need for Africa to cooperate with China to achieve industrialization, agri-modernization, food self-supply and improvement of people's health.
A lot of landmark architectures in Senegal were built with the support of China, Fall said, citing the Senegal National Grand Theater and Museum of Black civilizations as examples.
The theater is the largest aid project of China in the country since 2005 when the two countries resumed diplomatic ties, while the museum, now serving as a window to showcase Black civilizations, brings the dreams of generations of Africans come true, according to him.
The ambassador appreciated China's role in helping local people to realize an early food self-supply by sending expert teams to offer training on wetland rice and vegetables planting.
The first expressway in Senegal, also financed and constructed by Chinese company, will open to traffic soon, he added.
""Senegal can hardly achieve development and prosperity without China."" Fall stressed.
Fall added that the Senegalese government is now working on television digitalization with the help of China's technology company Huawei. In the future, cooperation in digitized information will be boosted further.
Apart from this, Senegal expects more participation from Chinese enterprises in its property projects to meet the country's increasing housing demand, he added. #XiJinping #XiVisit

Despite the disagreements between developed and developing nations, there are many positive factors at play at the UN climate conference in Paris, Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative for climate change, wrote in an article published by the People's Daily on Sunday.
The conference, set to take place through December 11, will see leaders from over 100 countries and organizations, including China, the US, EU, India and Brazil, to shape and mobilize policies to reduce carbon emissions worldwide.
Countries are showing a stronger desire to cooperate and act on climate change. More than 160 nations and regions – responsible for over 90 percent of global emissions - have pledged action plans to fight climate change by 2020.
As an important part of the Paris climate conference, these action plans will help control the increasing emission levels, provide clear and firm policy expectations to green investment and development of low-carbon technology, as well as drive long-term growth of global energy standards and new energy industries, Xie wrote.
Moreover, climate change policies from all participants are more positive, bilateral and now approaching trilateral cooperation. As the largest developing and developed countries in the world, China and the US for the last two years have released two joint declarations on climate change and are continuing policy talks and expanding cooperation.
In addition, China and #France, #EU, #India and #Brazil have respectively released joint declarations, all of which increase the world's confidence to cope with climate change.
Also, progress in energy saving and effectiveness, clean energy technology, development of the carbon market and green finance, as well as increasing worldwide consciousness of climate change, are providing positive energy to the meeting in Paris.
According to Xie, the Paris conference has the potential to produce a framework agreement of each participant's action plans after 2020, with details to be nailed down at later dates.
China hopes the Paris conference will reach a fair, balanced, ambitious and legally binding agreement signaling a global low-carbon transition, turn the climate change challenge into an opportunity to improve economic transitions, realize green development, and benefit economic development and climate protection for all. #COP21 #XiJinping #XiVisit

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the two-week conference in #Paris, #France, also known as the 21st Conference of the Parties to the #UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The highly-anticipated meeting, opened by leaders from over 150 countries, aims to yield a new international agreement to reduce greenhouse gases beyond 2020 when the 1997 #KyotoProtocol expires.

President Xi Jinping first expressed his sincere sympathy to French people on the recent Paris terrorism attack, which killed 130 innocent people at night of November 13, 2015. ""Terrorism cannot hold back efforts to address climate change,"" said Xi.

When speaking about climate change issues, Xi said developed countries should honor commitment of $100 billion climate fund annually by 2020, and provide stronger financial support to developing countries afterwards.

The Paris agreement should reject narrow-minded zero-sum game. ""We should create a future of the rule of law, fairness, and justice,"" added Xi.

Countries, at the same time, should be allowed to seek solutions that best suit their respective economic conditions, Xi said.

China has been actively engaged in a global campaign on climate change. China now tops the world in terms of energy conservation and utilization of new and renewable energies, and ecological development will feature prominently in China's Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, according to the President.

China will strive to fulfill the commitment to peak CO2 emission by around 2030, and by 2030 reduce CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 percent over the 2005 level, Xi said.

The country is to raise share of none-fossil fuel to primary energy consumption by about 20 percent, and increase forest stock by around 4.5 billion cubic meters over 2005, Xi said.

This September, China announced the establishment of RMB 20 billion South-South Climate Fund. Next year, China will launch cooperation projects to set up 10 pilot low-carbon industrial parks, and start 100 mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries, Xi announced.

China is to provide these developing countries with 1000 training opportunities for tackling climate change, Xi Jinping said.

""Tackling climate change is a shared mission of all mankind,"" Xi said. #COP21

A nongovernmental organization (NGO) apologized Sunday for posting a picture of a mother breast-feeding her child on the Beijing subway and accusing her of ""exposing sexual organs in public areas.""

""We apologize for posting (the picture) 'Breast-feeding in Beijing subway' and its social impact. We are not against but respect breast-feeding … The purpose of posting the picture is to call for a discussion of whether it is proper to breast-feed in public without any cover,"" Beijing-based NGO BJtale wrote on its Sina Weibo.

The picture posted on Friday showed a mother breast-feeding her child in a subway car with a caption saying that the mother should mind her behavior and not expose her sexual organs in a public area.

""Hey, mother, is it proper for you to do this? Or should I remind you that you are taking the subway in Beijing, not the bus in your village,"" read the post, which was later deleted, news website guancha.cn reported.

Hundreds of Net users reposted the picture, and more than 40,000 participated in the discussion of whether it is proper for mothers to breast-feed their children in public. Some Net users criticized the NGO for not respect the mother, and some contended that a mother should be able to feed her child whenever and wherever he or she is hungry.

The NGO explained in its Sunday apology that it directly reposted the pictures and copied comments from some Net users, saying that the organization believes that mothers should breast-feed with a cover if conditions are suitable, and that otherwise mothers should try to face away from others when breast-feeding their children.

China still lacks public facilities for mothers to nurse their infants, in spite of flash mobs held in some Chinese cities to draw awareness to breast-feeding.

The NGO - a grass-roots organization that has set up several welfare activities - had deleted all the posts as of the press time, and its last post on Sunday said that it has closed the Sina Weibo account to think over its mistake. http://en.people.cn/n/2015/1130/c90882-8983699.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1048417525210064/?type=3,2015-11-30 07:16:00,3818,118,77,3818,0,0,0,0,0

Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin never conceals his ambition to build a world leading sports company.
Wang's Wanda Group has set up Wanda Sports company, an integration of sports marketing company Infront Sports & Media and World Triathlon Corporation (WTC).
Wanda Group, a real estate giant in China, announced on Wednesday they appointed Philippe Blatter, FIFA president Sepp Blatter's nephew, president and CEO of Wanda Sports.
""The significance of establishing Wanda Sports is not only to integrate Wanda's interests in sports, but also to truly expand and strengthen Wanda's businesses in the industry,"" said Wang after the announcement.
Setting up the company was Wang's latest move to seize a big share of China's sports industry cake, which seems all the more lucrative as Beijing won the right to host 2022 Winter Olympic Games.
The Chinese government last year mapped out a plan which aims to grow its sports sector into a 5-trillion-yuan (about 813 billion U.S. dollars) industry by 2025.
The expectations have drawn hugh investment into the sector.
In less than a year, Wanda bought stake in Spanish La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, merged Infront and then bought WTC in August, spending about 11.6 billion yuan (about 1.85 billion U.S. dollars) in this area.
E-commerce titan Alibaba also showed great interest as they first paid 1.2 billion yuan (about 192 million U.S. dollars) for 50 percent stake in Guangzhou Evergrande, China's most successful soccer club and two-time Asian Champions League winner.
The Nasdaq-listed company, which have business cooperations with German champions Bayern Munich, Spanish giants Real Madrid and NBA star Kobe Bryant, then launched its own sports company in September to focus on professional sports.
Two other internet companies LeTV and Tencent jumped on the bandwagon by establishing respective sports companies as well.
Wang explained investors' enthusiasm at a summit of Chinese listed companies two weeks ago.
""China's sports industry is still in its cradle but the government has launched a plan to promote it and set a goal of 5 trillion yuan in scale. If the goal is realized, sports really is a very promising industry,"" he said.
Wang continued to speak out his ambitions.
""We plan to keep merging and add new content into our sports branch. Wanda Sports aim to become the world's first sports company with an annual income of more than 10 billion U.S. dollars,"" he said.
Wang, however, could still underestimate the potential as Chinese sports minister Liu Peng said last month the sports industry may reach 7 trillion yuan by 2025.

The West and Russia heightened their fight against the Islamic State (IS) after the Paris attacks. Meanwhile, a Chinese hostage was killed by the IS and three Chinese employees died in the terror attack in Mali. In this circumstance, it has been often raised both domestically and globally as to whether #China will join other countries in combating the IS head-on.
China's foreign ministry shunned a straightforward answer to the question, which is taken by many as also signifying China's attitude.
It will be a significantly major policy decision if China sends troops to the Middle East or conducts precision attacks far away. Despite the West's high expectations for China's participation, the Chinese government will be extremely prudent in making such a decision.
The West wants to take in China to jointly combat the IS since it remains the dominator in this respect. This can help China shape a positive image in international opinion and open up a new platform for China and the West over political communication and cooperation. But this may lead to a series of risks for China to bear, which can evolve into costs in reality. China has not been fully prepared for military operations. Not having engaged in battles for many years, China may find it hard to obtain full public support if its troops fight in the far away Middle East and more uncertainties will arise.

""China has the confidence and ability to sustain a medium-high growth rate."" Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Sunday while addressing a Group of 20 (G20) summit in Antalya in southwest Turkey.

China's confidence comes from its determination and actions to comprehensively deepen reform and build an open economic system, as well as the strong endogenous dynamic of China's economy and the policy guidance of the Chinese government, he added.

China shouldered the responsibility of driving economic growth in times of the world economic hardship, Xi said, noting that China had contributed up to 50 percent of world economic growth from 2009 to 2011.

""Despite a recent slowdown, China still contributes 30 percent to world economic growth, which means that China still acts as a major world economic powerhouse,"" said Xi.

The Chinese economy is predicted to grow about 7 percent this year, which will continue to contribute as high as about one third to the global growth, he said.

China has adopted a proposal on formulating the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) on national economic and social development, which aims to build a ""moderately prosperous society"" and double its 2010 GDP and per capita income of both urban and rural residents by 2020, said Xi.

In the next five years, China will adhere to a path of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development, and will encourage a system that nurtures innovation, he said.

The country will try to realize the synchronous development of the new type of industrialization, IT application, urbanization and agricultural modernization, he added.

""In the coming years, China will highlight green and low-carbon development, improve its environmental quality, become heavily involved in global economy, and carry out the Belt and Road Initiative,"" he said.

188625661189259_1031553666896450,"OP-ED: After the show, it's time for US destroyer to leave 

According to Reuters and the Wall Street Journal, the US Navy sent the guided-missile destroyer USS Lassen within 12 nautical miles of islands built by China in the South China Sea. US officials claimed that the action is aimed at safeguarding the freedom of navigation and did not target China. The patrols could also be conducted around features that Vietnam and the Philippines have built up in the South China Sea. According to the US side, the action has been approved by President Barack Obama, but with no notification for China.

Washington hinted long ago that it would send ships within 12 nautical miles of China's islands, but it didn't say explicitly what it would do. The US said the action would last several hours. According to Western media, Chinese navy ships are closely watching the Lassen. The Pentagon is obviously provoking China. It is time to test the wisdom and determination of the Chinese people.

We should stay calm. If we feel disgraced and utter some furious words, it will only make the US achieve its goal of irritating us.

We should analyze the actual condition of the US harassment. It seems that the US only wants to display its presence as it didn't raise the imprudent demand that China stops island-building. It has no intention to launch a military clash with China. It is just the US' political show. The UN Convention of the Law of the Sea provides three categories. The first is islands, which are naturally formed, habitable areas above water at high tide, and are therefore entitled to 12 nautical miles of territorial waters and a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones (EEZs). The second is reefs that have portions above water at low tide, and are uninhabitable, which have territorial waters but no EEZs. Finally, completely submerged ""low tide elevations"" have no territorial waters.

The islands and reefs in the Nansha Islands under the control of the Chinese mainland belong to the latter two categories. China did not elaborate whether it will expand its territorial seas after land construction. This is where the ambiguity of the international law. In addition, China hasn't announced its territorial baseline in the South China Sea, making the legal meaning of Sino-US contention in the South China Sea vague.

China and the US have no conflicting views over the international law. Instead, the two are competing with each other over the rules and orders in the South China Sea. Beijing's construction work in the area is completely legal, and there is nothing Washington can blame it for. Yet, from Washington's perspective, the geopolitical situation in the area will be changed following China's island reclamation. Beijing may seize the advantage to control the Nansha Islands and their adjacent seas. The US also conjectures that China will gain strategic pivots for power projection to the south in the future. Therefore, Washington, annoyed and anxious, has taken actions in order to balance Beijing's clout and to consolidate its dominance in the South China Sea.

It has to be noticed that China has already carried out construction work in the area. This is the concrete achievements Beijing has gained. Completing building the islands still remains as a major task for China in the future. At present, no country, the US included, is able to obstruct Beijing's island reclamation in the region.

In face of the US harassment, Beijing should deal with Washington tactfully and prepare for the worst. This can convince the White House that China, despite its unwillingness, is not frightened to fight a war with the US in the region, and is determined to safeguard its national interests and dignity.

Beijing ought to carry out anti-harassment operations. We should first track the US warships. If they, instead of passing by, stop for further actions, it is necessary for us to launch electronic interventions, and even send out warships, lock them by fire-control radar and fly over the US vessels.

Chinese should be aware that the US harassment is only a common challenge in China's rise. We should regard it with calm and be confident of our government and troops. It is certain that the Chinese government, ordering the land reclamation, is able and determined to safeguard the islands. China is gradually recovering its justified rights in the South China Sea. China has not emphasized the ""12 nautical miles."" It is the US that helps us to build and reinforce this concept. Then, it is fine for us to accept the ""12 nautical miles"" and we have no intention to accept 13 or more than 13 nautical miles.

188625661189259_1030463283672155,"Commentary: Where will China go in the next five years?

The autumn in Beijing is not only about foliage. We always have more to expect.

Chinese Communist Party will hold a vital meeting in Beijing from October 26 to October 29, at which the development roadmap for China from 2016 to 2020 will be discussed, namely China's 13th Five-Year Plan.

The Five-Year plans are China's development agendas set by CCP. We have accomplished 12 Five-Year plans in the past, and here comes the 13th. In Chinese traditions, every 60 years marks a circle, so the year 2016 will be the beginning of a new circle. Hence, we have good reasons to believe that the 13th Five-Year Plan will be a brand new start for China.

People all around China are paying close attention to this plan. In accordance with China's development goal, a moderately prosperous society shall be built by 2020. The phrase ""moderately prosperous society"" or in Chinese ""Xiaokang"", has its special meaning to Chinese people. For thousands of years, it describes a promising prospect for the development of our nation and the improvement of people's life. It means not only steady economic growth, but also a real leap-forward for people's living standard, including the 70 million impoverished populations in China.

To achieve this goal is critical but not easy. We've seen China's president Xi Jinping discussing this agenda with local government officials from 18 provinces from May to July. This shows how much emphasis the Chinese leaders are putting on this agenda to make it scientifically reasonable and reliable.

The 13th Five-Year plan concerns much more than the future of China. Statistics from the World Bank shows that China has contributed to 30% of the global economic growth in the past two years. Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times once said, as the second largest economy in the world, if China sneezed, the world economy would catch a cold according. China is promoting the Belt and Road Initiative, which will cover 60 countries and regions with a total population of 4.4 billion, and account for 30 percent of the whole global economy. The blueprint of this imitative shows China's efforts on reforming the geographic distribution of the international economy. That also draws our attention to a key question: ""Where will China go in the next five years?""

Like many people have said, China is still facing many unsolved problems. For example, the smog is hovering several major Chinese cities, which even caused discomfort of athletes at China Open. Besides, China has a population of over 1.3 billion, which is over four times more than that of America. The population scale makes all the problems even more challenging. However, the CCP has been quite experienced in facing the complexity of China. During the 12th Five-Year Plan, China's development has amazed the whole world with an 8 percent annual economic growth rate. More importantly, Chinese leaders have explored a unique development path for China and ensured the value of it.

This path is what President Xi Jinping mentioned as ""Three laws"" and ""Three Developments""-- a scientific development path that follows the laws of economics; a sustainable development path that follows the laws of nature; and an inclusive development path that follows the laws of human society. With ""laws of economics"", ""laws of nature"" and ""laws of human society"" being highlighted in CCP's new policies, we can see GDP will no longer be the only performance appraisal for local government officials. China has passed more strict environmental protection provisions and released more specific plans to solve the poverty problems, especially for people living in remote rural areas.

We have confidence that the new development path will forecast the 13th Five-Year Plan a more effective one. This plan will also demonstrate a true meaning of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is to play by the laws of the market as well as the government regulation, and to pay attention to economic development as well as people's living standards. It's widely believed that such development path will benefit more people not only limited in China, where its value will apply to the world.

China's high-speed railway has been exported to the United States. Recently, a series of photos is going viral on the Internet, which shows Chinese people are climbing through the windows onto the trains in a railway station 13 years ago in Sichuan, when railroad and trains were still so rare in China. China's development is just like the expansion of its railroads and trains. The 13th Five-Year Plan will set a new track for China. Where will China go in the next five years? Let's just imagine!

There was much pomp and ceremony surrounding Xi's visit with carriage rides up the Mall and State banquets. Whether he enjoyed his lobster mousse, roasted venison is unclear, but Britain has certainly pulled out the stops to make Xi feel welcome.

Pragmatism

China is expected to plough £8 billion into the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station - a third of the total cost with the rest paid by the French energy company EDF. Nuclear power is extremely expensive and extra money is needed for such projects.

Although some people have been critical, many have been pragmatic and feel that industries should be sold off to those who might well be able to run them better.

""I'm all for it. I think more countries should be brought in to run things,"" said one respondent to Polly Toynbee's article in the Guardian. The NHS work better if owned by the French and roads might be a dream to drive on should the Swiss take charge of Britain's road network, he said writing under the pseudonym BrasilBranche.

The deal is very much a ""win-win"" deal for both countries in that China will likely get financial returns whilst Britain saves in the expensive construction.

While the Hinkley Point project in Somerset is purely a financial investment, China is hoping to build one of their own designs at Bradwell in Essex and another at Sizewell in Suffolk which would likely act as a stepping stone for selling Chinese technology elsewhere.

Seeking better ties

While there has been much critical comment directed towards both the UK government and China, the majority of Britons are in favour of seeking closer ties with China. According to a YouGov poll, British people expect China to overtake the rest of Europe as the UK's main trading partner within the next 20 years. Moreover, when asked if Britain should seek closer trading ties with China more than 40% wanted better ties, while just 8% said they would like to see the relationship diminished.

Currently Britain sells more to Ireland and Belgium than it does to China. But this may well change as Sino-UK relations improve.

Of course Britain is hedging its bets on China for a number of reasons. Anglo-American ties are now at their lowest ebb for years. And the relationship with the European Union is not particularly comfortable either.

There are certainly concerns felt by some Britons over China. But China and Britain has much to gain. Indeed, it could prove to be a ""win-win"" situation for both countries.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is planning to build a village on the moon. No, not a tiny research facility with a couple of sparse structures, but a full-on, habitable village with citizens from around the world, facilitated by robotic astronaut missions and supported by communication satellites.

The new Director General of the ESA, Professor Johann-Dietrich Woerner, proposed the plan for a village on the moon at the 66th International Astronautical Congress in Jerusalem last week.

""We should look to the future beyond the International Space Station,"" Woener said to the BBC, ""We should look for a smaller spacecraft in low-Earth orbit for microgravity research and I propose a Moon village on the far side of the Moon.""

""A Moon village shouldn't just mean some houses, a church and a town hall,"" says Woerner. ""This Moon village should mean partners from all over the world contributing to this community with robotic and astronaut missions and support communication satellites.""

Woerner sees the moon as a place to bridge Earthly problems. He also invited China to join the Moon village plan. He envisions the Moon village having astronauts, Russian cosmonauts, and Chinese taikonauts. ""We should have international cooperation, without any limitations, with any countries of the world,"" he added. http://en.people.cn/n/2015/1023/c98649-8966280.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1029070760478074/?type=3,2015-10-23 06:14:01,6573,130,725,6573,0,0,0,0,0

Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the openness and inclusiveness of China's ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative when attending the China-UK Business Summit on October 21 in #London.

Xi emphasized that China and the UK complement each other's industrial framework and share the same goals of open market, free trade and bilateral investment. The future is promising for bilateral cooperation under the ""One Belt and One Road"" framework.

China welcomes the capital, technology and talent the joint exchanges with the #UK. Meanwhile, China seeks to cooperate with the UK to help countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America develop together.

China has always stressed the openness of the ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative since Xi had proposed it two years ago. During his visit to the #US in September, Xi for the first time invited the US to be involved in the initiative, but received no direct response.
The UK will set precedent for other countries not included along the route, as the country's involvement will not only strengthen bilateral relations, but also help boost development of third-party markets.

Wang Yiwei, a scholar in international relations at Renmin University of China, pointed out that many countries along the ""One Belt, One Road"" used to be British colonies that share similar financial and judicial systems with the UK.

China-UK cooperation will benefit communications with third parties, giving all sides an opportunity to generate mutually beneficial gains. This embodies the spirit of the Silk Road -- openness, cooperation, inclusiveness and a win-win strategy, as well as ushers in a new model of economic globalization.

Despite the obvious decline in trade between China and its major European partners during January and September this year, China and the UK have maintained stable trade volume, which shows the stable and sustainable relationship between the two countries.
President Xi Jinping's visit to the UK will bring bilateral economic and trade relations to a new stage, Chinese Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng told the People's Daily.
Trade relations between China and the UK have survived the European debt crisis and an unbalanced global economic recovery. The UK has become China's second-largest trading partner in the EU, as well as China's second real investment source and investment target country. China is also the UK's fourth largest trading partner.
According to Gao, China-UK bilateral trade volume in 2014 reached $80.87 billion, with year-on-year growth of 15.3 percent. The growth rate, while doubled the volume five years ago, is the highest among China's major trading partners in the EU. The UK's direct investment stock in China is growing steadily. By the end of August, UK had invested in 7,992 programs in China, while real investment reached $19.61 billion.
China's direct investment stock in the UK sharply rose to $12.8 billion by the end of 2014 from 2010's $1.35 billion, and now over 500 China-invested enterprises have settled in the UK.
In addition, the two sides are conducting effective cooperation in areas like technological innovation, service trading, local cooperation and third-party markets. Bilateral economic and trade cooperation is steadily progressing, investment is deepening, and new areas of cooperation are developing.
China is drawing up its 13th five-year plan for economic and social development, making efforts to open new doors and accelerate the establishment of an open economic system.
China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative, the UK's status as a founding member of the AIIB and its economic plan for the Northwest UK will provide more opportunities for cooperation between the two countries, said Gao. #XiUKVisit #XiJinping

Chinese President Xi Jinping's UK visit from October 19 to 23 is of great significance to China's relations with the UK and other European countries, read a commentary published by People's Daily on Monday that also analyzed the global impact of China-EU ties.

Chinese Ambassador to Britain Liu Xiaoming previously said that the ""golden era"" of Sino-UK relation is not built in a day, but is the result of long-term efforts. People from the two countries are expecting Xi's visit to be a splendid milestone of new progress in Sino-UK ties.

Sino-UK relations have harvested inspiring achievements in the past decade with more progress expected in the future. Many unprecedented moves in regards of Sino-UK cooperation have been actualized asthe two countries become increasingly intimate, bringing a positive impact and experience to the global community.

The UK government has said multiple times in public statements that the development of China is an opportunity rather than a challenge.

Britain has expressed its hope to become China's best friend in Europe, and Xi's visit can serve as a good opportunity to boost not only Sino-UK ties but also China's relations with other European countries, said the report, quoting a British scholar. Sino-EU relations have found a steady and prosperous momentum, and economic and trade cooperation between China and the UK is more and more highlighted.

As China implements all-around reform and Europe sets off on its way to structural reform, common interestand considerable cooperation is promising.

Sino-UK relations are a miniature of China's relations with the world, and especially with western countries, the People's Daily commentarysaid.

China's shameful history in modern times began amid the roar of Britain warships' guns, the modern technology of which shredded China's fantasy of being the ""center of the universe,"" inspiring the ancient giant to begin its journey to independence and prosperity.

Now China has grasped the essence of peace and development, and by upholding the spirit of ""peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit,"" China has changed the zero-sum mindset that has dominated international relations for centuries.

Disagreements and disturbances occur from time to time, as China and western countries differ greatly in terms of regimes and ideology. Ideologicalprejudice and misjudgment of actual interests sometimes make it difficult to perceive the whole picture as a win-win situation and to approach relations with mutual respect. Respect for regimes and each other's core benefits is a foundation of any development in bilateral relations. Calm strategic views are what is needed to boost Sino-EU relations.

China and European countries need more dialogue about reform to understand and trust each other and to abide by the philosophy of mutual respect, seek win-win scenarios, and uphold the spirit of treating each other equally and allowing disagreement while seeking common ground.

Though geographically separated by over 8,000 kilometers and an eight-hour time difference, people from China and the UK have never ceased to pursue friendly relations. A bridge characterized by peace, growth, reform and civilization has reached out from both sides with joint effort. Enthusiasm in the UK for Xi's visit is similar to the scene witnessed when Xi visited European citieslast March.

A new ""golden era"" of Sino-UK relations and a new milestone in the Sino-EU friendship will be witnessed this golden autumn.

Reuters: London is one of the world's financial centers, and is keen to play an important role in China's financial development, whether by serving as an offshore trading hub for the renminbi or by possibly one day having a trading link between London and Shanghai stock exchanges. What role do you envision London playing in the modernization and globalization of the Chinese currency and stock markets?

Xi: The reform and opening up of China's financial sector has made remarkable progress since China embarked on the path of reform and opening up 37 years ago. This has been especially obvious in the past several years. China will continue to adopt multiple measures to advance the reform and opening up of its financial sector so that its financial market can better adapt to financial modernization and globalization.

As one of the global financial centers, London is an important pump station in the world economic lifeline, so to speak. Strengthened financial cooperation with London is definitely a win-win choice for both countries. China-UK financial cooperation started early. It has enjoyed rapid growth, has tremendous potential and leads China-UK cooperation in various areas. We have accomplished much in recent years. Our two countries signed the bilateral currency swap agreement. China set up an RMB clearing bank in London. The UK became the first country outside Asia to obtain the RQFII initial investment quota, the first Western country to issue RMB-denominated sovereign bond and the first major developed country to include RMB into its foreign exchange reserves. This is a highlight in our bilateral cooperation.

Back in 2012, London officially launched the plan of Center of RMB Business. London has since then become one of the most dynamic and most important RMB trading centers and offshore RMB markets. In 2014, RMB trading in London grew by 143 percent year-on-year and its RMB deposits reached 20 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 37 percent.

When conditions are in place, China is ready to consider strengthening the connectivity of the financial markets of the two countries. London can leverage its unique strengths in the financial field to get actively involved in the modernization and globalization of China' s financial market.","Photos from People's Daily, China's post",photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1026536874064796/?type=3,2015-10-18 13:43:00,4836,24,120,4836,0,0,0,0,0

""President Xi Jinping's state visit to the UK will usher in a 'golden decade' and a new dimension for cooperation between China and the UK.""  

Tony Blair, the former British Prime Minister said in a group interview with the Chinese journalists in his office in central #London, ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the UK from Oct. 19 to 23, the first state visit by a Chinese president to the UK in 10 years. 

Blair said, during the decade he spent as prime minister, he put a great deal of emphasis on establishing a strong relationship with China. The current Prime Minister David Cameron is further strengthening the relationship with China. It shows that all different political parties in UK have reached consensuses on further developing the ties with China. They all think that Sino-UK ties are very important. 

Blair served as British Prime Minister from 1997 to 2007. It was in May 2004 that China and the UK established a comprehensive strategic partnership.
 
Blair said, the UK is an open country and has obvious advantages in the fields of trade, financial services and so on. The economic and trade cooperation between China and UK is highly complementary. UK welcomes the rapid growth of Chinese investment in UK. He expects the two countries to deepen the cooperation in the fields of infrastructure and finance. 

According to media reports, business deals including on nuclear energy and high-speed rail will be key topics for discussion between China and the UK during President Xi's visit.  

Blair welcomes the Chinese enterprises to invest in the nuclear energy and high-speed rail in UK. He expects the two countries to cooperate more in these fields.   

""The UK needs major infrastructure investment in nuclear power and rail construction, and China has the expertise in both, as well as the capital to deploy,"" Blair said.  

""If we renew our railways,"" he added, ""we can actually ease a lot of problems of overcrowding, housing and difficulties of people finding work. You must get the rail networks up to speed as a high-speed rail network."" He stressed that this cooperation would be win-win to both countries.  

In the field of financial cooperation, Blair suggested that China should take advantage of the platform of London as an international finance centre to achieve the goal of the internationalization of Renminbi, issue the RMB government bonds in the UK and ensure that the two countries carry out pragmatic cooperation at the financial field.  

Blair stressed that people-to-people exchanges are vital, such as the thousands of Chinese who study in the UK.  

""We want to send more British students to China,"" he said,""When these people come back to their home country after studying, they know more about the country (China), they know more about the people and culture, which makes for a stronger relationship.""  

In terms of Sino-European relations，Blair said, as an important member in EU, the UK maintains a good partnership with China, so it will help to promote the overall development of Sino-EU relations.  

In the international arena, Blair said, the two countries should further enhance the cooperation in many areas, such as combating terrorism and climate change, and so on.  

He stressed China's global role, saying: ""How China develops its role in the world has massive implications for everyone today.  There is no big global problem that can be sorted without China."" Blair said, the international community expects China to play an increasingly large role.

188625661189259_1015646351820515,"Commentary: The Prospect of Chinese Economy Is Still Bright

China-U.S. economic and trade deals account for over two thirds on the list of all 49 deals President Xi Jinping sealed during his U.S. State Visit. Among them are joint-ventured company to build a 370-kilometer high-speed rail line linking Southern California to Las Vegas, collaboration between Microsoft and Xiaomi to provide ""cloud service"" for customers, construction of a manufacturing base in Massachusetts with $60 million investments from CRRC Co., and so on. As two giant economies, China and the U.S. are tightly connected to each other. The trade and economy on high levels are bringing along unlimited business opportunities.  

There have been doubts about whether Chinese economy would have a so-called ""hard-landing"", or whether the fluctuation in Chinese stock market would influence the direction of China's reform. ""China's economy will stay on a steady course with fairly fast growth"", said President Xi in Seattle. ""Opportunities facing the two countries require a deepened China-U.S. trade cooperation."" Echoing all these statements made by President Xi in the State Visit, the achievements made during the past week have sent a clear signal: China will stay on its reform track despite the fluctuations in the market. The Chinese economy has been brought into a new status and will keep the accelerating rate as it steps into a higher level. The future prospect is still bright. 

Let the statistics say. Despite the complexity and volatilities of world economy, Chinese economy maintains a 7 percent growth rate in the first half of this year, which is one of the highest in the world. 

In the first six months of this year, 7.18 million new jobs have been created in cities and towns, achieving 71.8 percent of the annual goal. The average income rate has grown by 7.6 percent year on year. The two core indices of employment and income have shown the steady growth of Chinese economy. 

In the past 8 months, China attracts $85.3 billion of foreign direct investment, seeing a 9 percent increase year on year. This indicates that foreign investors still hold firm confidence in Chinese economy. On the other hand, China has invested in 4862 companies across 150 countries and regions. These overseas investments accumulate to 473.43 billion Chinese Yuan, with an 18.2 percent increase from last year. 

The potential of Chinese market is huge with the new industrialization and advancing IT application, urbanization and agricultural modernization. Chinese people are becoming more willing to spend what they have earned through hard work. The middle-class is rising up in China. All of these are the basic facts about Chinese economy.

Time will tell. People know Chinese economy well would see that the current problems are just temporary in economic transformations. The key to solving these questions is reform and opening-up. The upcoming new round of reform is unprecedentedly comprehensive. The 3rd Plenary Session of 18th CPC Central Committee has set guidance for continuing policy reforms. Over 330 points to reform have been raised. The 80 major reform tasks have been mostly finished in 2014. About 70 reform proposals have been raised in the first six months of this year, of which the effects will gradually unveil. 
We all know it well that the most imperative problem to solve for China is to the imbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable problems emerged in the development. To evaluate the quality and rewards in Chinese economic growth, strong incentives are needed. 

To reform means to change, and changes are often enshrouded with uncertainty. Worries over uncertainty keep Chinese people vigilant in its economic development. 

China is trying hard to keep the macro economy stable through practical actions. To tackle the abnormal fluctuations in the stock market, Chinese government curbed the spread of panic and thus avoided a systemic risk. China has also finalized the RMB exchange rate quotation mechanism. 

Short-term currency fluctuations might occur, but there is no basis for any continued depreciation. Increasing the intensity of market-determined exchange rate is part of an established market-oriented reform. This has nothing to do with a so-called ""currency war"". The speculations of stimulating exports for any so-called ""quick fix"" are ludicrous. 

To drive this train named Chinese economy, we do not need to press the accelerator, or to pull the break. Chinese economy will be escalating in a steady way. No nation is isolated in globalization. Win-win, instead zero-sum game, is the right way for economic development. 
""The interests of China and the United States are deeply interconnected, and we have greater responsibilities for world peace and human progress,"" said President Xi at the joint press conference with President Obama in Washington, D.C. 

President Xi's statement reveals the logic behind the global economic growth. China has a huge economic potential, with leeway and internal strength coming at the same time. China is thus fully able to maintain a high level of long-term economic growth, and to provide a vast market and a solid support for the world economy. An open China will continue to draw strength from the developing world, and the development of China will eventually benefit the world. #XiUSAVisit #XiJinping

188625661189259_1013099405408543,"Obama and Xi Must Do More Than Agree to Disagree: Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter

I have been fascinated with China since my first visit to Qingdao in 1949, just a short time before the Peoples' Republic was founded on October 1, my 25th birthday.
I was governor of Georgia when President Nixon made his historic visit to China in 1972, and was disappointed when no additional moves were made to establish diplomatic relations between our two countries. I set this as a high priority when I became president, and initiated high-level negotiations with Chinese leaders. These efforts became successful when Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping and I announced on December 15, 1978 that full mutual recognition would take place at the beginning of the next year. He announced three days later that dramatic reforms would take place in his country, and that it would be ""opened up."" Few people anticipated how these two decisions would so drastically affect the global community.
Since leaving office, I have made regular visits to China, and have been welcomed by its top political leaders, those in the private sector, and by private citizens in many communities. The Carter Center has been asked by the government to perform important duties, including the implementation and assessment of fully democratic elections in China's 600,000 villages, which has included almost two-thirds of the population. We now concentrate on working to reduce misperceptions held by one nation about the other by convening annual forums on improving relations and finding ways for the U.S. and China to wage peace and sustain development in other countries, especially in Africa.
During my four visits with President Xi Jinping in recent years, he has stressed, like Deng Xiaoping before him, the need for our political leaders to respect each other and to cooperate when possible, in spite of the dramatic differences in our history, culture, and political systems. It has always been clear that in both countries there are potential political leaders who, for their own benefit, have blamed the other country for domestic problems and tried to exacerbate the inherent differences that always exist.
Like the United States, China is facing many serious domestic challenges. China is struggling to improve the quality of life for the citizens who live further from its East coast, and to shift from a relatively burgeoning economy based on exports to one that is accommodating increasing dependence on domestic consumers. Unlike in the past, its political and economic impact is felt in almost every corner of the globe.
China has remained at peace with its neighbors and others for the past 35 years, but its expansion of influence has brought it into contention, especially relative to its southern and eastern seas.
Although many of my successors as president have made negative comments about relations with China during their campaigns, almost all of these have been moderated when they were elected to our nation's top office. I am sure the same situation has existed in China.
The first official state visit for President Xi Jinping to the United States will offer him and President Obama a chance to explore how our two great nations can deal with each other peacefully, as equals, and with mutual respect.
The Chinese must understand that America would like to see a peaceful, prosperous, and free China and that we do not wish to undermine the rise of China. Similarly, Americans need to understand that China differs from the Soviet Union that we faced in the Cold War. China needs to be encouraged to participate in and defend the international order governed by international laws and norms.
While the current challenges that threaten to derail the U.S.-China relationship are great, I am sure that Deng Xiaoping would agree with me that none of these challenges are more daunting than the ones we worked together to conquer.
Finding ways toward peace and sustained development at home and abroad are at the core of the missions of both President Obama and President Xi. With many conflicts raging and the global economy still fragile, now is the time for each nation to defend a global order conducive to peace and development.
The two presidents must use their meeting later this month to do more than simply agree to disagree on many issues. They can forge a consensus on how to build trust through U.S.-China collaboration that acts to solve our common global challenges. Our joint commitment to take the lead on pressing environmental challenges would set an example that few other nations could not follow. #XiJinping #XiUSAVisit

Scientists from the University of Cambridge have developed a mother robot that independently builds its own baby robots and then tests their performances to inform the future design.

The mother robot first glues one to five modules together to make a child robot and put a slightly-different motor inside each cube. Then it tests how far each cube moves from a starting point in a certain amount of time, with the best individual's traits carried over into the next generation.

The lead researcher Dr Fumiya Iida said their experiments bring about interesting results.

""The mother robot can actually build hundreds of child robots and see the performance of these child robots and, if their performance is good, keep their design for the next generation. And if bad, just let it go. And just repeating this iterative design improvement processes, the mother robot can actually gradually improve the performance of the child robot."" http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0906/c202936-8946123.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/1001798923205258/?type=3,2015-09-06 00:00:01,4986,24,112,4986,0,0,0,0,0

However, several Japanese media have a wrong understanding of the aim of the parade, saying that the parade aimed to show the muscle of the Chinese army and contain Japan. Such statements are narrow-minded and a distortion of facts. China doesn't need to conduct a grand parade just to cope with the problems of Sino-Japanese relations. Besides, China never shows off its military strength, and it always keeps a low profile.

It's unnecessary for Japanese media to ""over-interpret"" the aim of the parade. In fact, the aim is very clear: to commemorate history, cherish the memory of fallen revolutionary heroes, uphold peace and usher in the future.

Sources close to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday that the Japanese leader's statement on Friday will include key words such as ""apology"", and observers said Abe is possibly doing so because of pressures both internally and externally.

The cost of a single J-10 is estimated at $40 million, making the value of the deal around $1 billion. But Iran will not pay a dollar for the transaction. Instead, they will grant Beijing a 20-year exploitation right to the Azadegan oilfield.

On the other hand, the prospect of a US interest rate rise and the ongoing turmoil in the eurozone have put governments and investors on edge. Slower growth and recent market volatility in some of Asia's leading economies, including the People's Republic of China, have raised the question whether Asia will remain the engine of global growth.

Before raising the alarm bells, some perspective is in order. In a supplement to the Asian Development Outlook released this month, we project developing Asia's growth will moderate slightly. Growth in 2015 will be 6.1%, a downward adjustment by 0.2 percentage points from our projection in March.

Cao Shihong and Ma Xuemei gave birth to a pair of twin sisters in August of 2009. However, the fates of the twins are very different, New Express Daily reported.

Elder girl Chuting is a healthy child, but her little sister Yuyiwas diagnosed with severe thalassemia at the age of 2.

Yuyi needs a blood transfusion every twenty days. She also needs to have injections five times a week for excretion of iron.

6 -year-old Chuting wants to save her little sister by giving her hematopoietic stem cells. "" I am not afraid of pain, I just want my little sister to get better "" she says.

Fortunately, the two sisters'stem cell matches. Since Yuyi was diagnosed with thalassemia, Ma Xuemei, their mother quit her job and took full-time care of the sick girl.

The father is the only bread earner of the family, who works hard every day to bring 3,000 yuan home monthly. The money barely covers blood transfusions fees and their daily life.

The family is not giving up. They borrowed 200,000 yuan from their relatives and friends; currently, the family still needs another 100,000 yuan for transplant surgery to save the little girl. http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0731/c98649-8929236.html",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/978322055552945/?type=3,2015-07-30 20:47:01,19831,107,149,19831,0,0,0,0,0

Although China is growing at a slower pace, the volume of money generated is actually higher because China's gross domestic product (GDP) is much larger than it was decades ago, he told the workshop held at the headquarters of Fundacao Getulio Vargas, one of the most renowned college education institutions and a famous think tank for public policies in Brazil.

China will send 500 million tourists abroad over the next five years, is expected to purchase 10 trillion U.S. dollars worth of goods from other nations, and invest 500 billion dollars abroad, Yang said.

Yang also stressed that China has been carrying out reforms in various areas, such as environment, fiscal and economic systems, and governance, to make the country more efficient.

China has strong economic fundamentals, such as its savings rate which is among the highest in the world, and an increasing per capita income, he added.

Yang praised Brazil, which he is visiting for the first time, saying some aspects of the Brazilian culture, such as soccer and music, are well appreciated in China.

Brazil, as a strategic partner of China with increasingly close relations with China, is expected to benefit from China's growth, he said.

China and Brazil are co-members of many forums, such as BRICS and G20, and the two countries have also seen frequent exchanges of visits by their leaders, Yang said.

Brazil's tourist spots are favored by many Chinese citizens, and Chinese companies operating in Brazil generate various jobs in the country, Yang said.

Cooperation between China and Brazil, he said, will be good to both countries and the world, and the two countries should join hands in their pursuit of growth and development.

Among the wounded, 65 are in serious condition, but have all been sent to local hospitals to receive treatment. The explosion happened near a massive refinery plant in the city's Huangdao district late Friday morning. The blast sent thick black smoke billowing into the sky and could be seen for kilometers.

Local authorities said that around 3am, an oil pipeline ruptured causing a leak. Initial investigation results suggest the repair process led to a fire, which eventually caused the explosion at around 10am. The 176-kilometer-long pipeline is owned by Sinopec, China's largest oil refiner, and was put into operation this August.

Beijing Symphony Orchestra has embarked its world tour in October this year, giving performances in Mexico and the US. On October 17, the orchestra made its first appearance in Carnegie Hall, New York. 

Led by Tan Linhua, President and Principal Conductor of the Orchestra, the group aimed to share with the audience works of Western classical and Chinese contemporary symphonic music. The evening began with Lotus Overture and the Chinese flute concerto, Chou Kong Shan (Sorrowful Desolate Mountain) by a Chinese composer called Guo Wenjing. 

The orchestra particularly amazed audience with the second piece, in which Bamboo Flute soloist Tang Jun Qiao played the instrument brilliantly, a showcase of Chinese instruments to Westerners. 

Having given many performances in Europe, Mr. Tan saw the similarity between the audience in two continents, he told People's Daily Online. ""I have been touring in Europe a lot; I think the reaction of the audience here is similar. They are picky, because they have a lot of good experiences with wonderful orchestras here,"" he said. 

Mr. Tan observed that in comparison to the Mexican audience whom they had met in their tour, Chinese audience tends to be relatively conservative, while the former group showed great enthusiasm. 

Overall, Mr. Tan said he's very satisfied with the success the orchestra had of the night in New York. The orchestra ended the concert with a total of five encores, with one of them as the famous Chinese music Jasmine.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/photos/a.191212920930533.63965.188625661189259/620926857959135/?type=3,2013-10-18 18:00:01,93,0,2,93,0,0,0,0,0

In New York City, haggard women can often be seen begging for money with a baby. And most of the time, the toddler is sleeping. Have you ever wondered why?

It is been widely known that these beggars are controlled by a highly structuralized organization. But what mysterious is the slumbering kids in their arms. One day, a reporter saw a beggar with an infant sitting near a subway entrance. The reporter approached her and asked what happened to the baby, but the woman just waved him away. The reporter stayed there and watched them for the whole day, but the baby never woke up, nor did it move. Later that evening, a vehicle came and drove the woman and the baby away. The baby was still in coma. 

The next day, the reporter saw the same beggar sitting on the same spot as yesterday, only that she was holding another baby. Again, it looked as if it was sleeping. The reporter asked what happened to the baby yesterday, and why this baby was sleeping. The woman just kept silence. Sensing that there was something wrong, the reporter alerted the police. But by the time the police arrived, both the woman and the baby were gone.

A drug addict later told the reporter that the people behind this operation feed the babies heroin and vodka every day before they were brought to streets. This is to prevent them from crying and making noises when the adults are begging for money. The drug addict also said that toddlers under age 3 appear to be particularly vulnerable to such strong substances; many of them died few hours after they are fed. And the beggar still needs to hold the body in her arms as if it's sleeping for the whole day.

The people behind this operation are awfully cruel and cold-blooded. They exploit our compassions and brutally use babies as their money maker.

If you happen to see beggars like this on the street, don't give them money, because your money will only encourage the organization's growth, which will in turn kill more infants.",,status,,2013-03-26 15:25:34,3,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0

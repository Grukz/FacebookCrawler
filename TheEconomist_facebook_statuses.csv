FOR drone strikes: Armed drones do not undermine the rules of war and remain conventional weapons, with humans subject to the conventional tests that their action be discriminate and proportionate.

AGAINST drone strikes: Drones are an invasion of privacy as they enable people's activities to be monitored continuously when they are outdoors, even when they are on their own private property.

AGAINST: Rich-country governments can use drones to get rid of their enemies without any risk to themselves. That is immoral, and likely to undermine self-restraint.

AGAINST drone strikes: Drones are used to assassinate people, such as Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric killed in Yemen. That's not war, that's extra-judicial execution.

FOR censorship: False rumours can spread like wildfire and sow panic. Tweets about gunmen attacking schools in Mexico allegedly led to 26 car crashes.

AGAINST censorship: Rescue services increasingly rely on social networks for real-time information during emergencies, such as the Japan tsunami in 2011. Any restrictions could cost lives.

AGAINST censorship: Social media have created an upheaval in the way we communicate, but so did the telephone in its day, and email too. The idea of censorship is just a knee-jerk reaction to sudden change.

FOR censorship: Social media don't just let two people communicate; they make everyone a potential broadcaster, without any of the usual codes of ethics or professional standards. That's too much power in people's hands.

AGAINST: Social media allow people who might never otherwise meet to connect with each other. That gives them unparalleled opportunities to build both personal and professional contacts, which censorship would limit.

The heir to the British throne keeps doing things right. Eleven months ago, he married the best of all possible princesses. This week, she gave him the heir to the heirdom, and he carried the baby out of St Mary's hospital 37 hours after his wife had gone in. What Queen Victoria did for chloroform, the Princess of Wales has done for short stays in the maternity wards. 

The happiest stories are often the shortest ones. But this one will run on for years. The baby in question will probably still be head of state in the year 2050.

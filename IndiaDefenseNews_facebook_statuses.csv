In an exclusive interview to Defence Aviation Post General Rawat said, ""I want to reach out to the people of Kashmir, particularly to the parents of those who have taken to insurgency and tell them that it is doing no good to the people of South Kashmir or Kashmir as such.""

""To live in a Utopian world and say that there is going to be azadi and in that they are going to join Pakistan which will take over Kashmir, I think such people are living in a euphoria and a fool's world.""

Sending out a strong message, Gen Rawat said, ""Let it be clear to all. 

The Indian Army and the Indian establishments are strong enough to control the situation.""

These are the first official comments made by Gen Rawat following repeated attempts to disrupt normalcy in the valley particularly in South Kashmir.

Gen Rawat also made it very clear that while the Army will be able to bring things under control but ""it is going to come at some cost and that cost is being borne by the local population.""

Stating that ever since 1990, enough has happened to Kashmir, Gen Rawat said, ""We don't want this anymore….One generation has been lost and has suffered and today they are living in this kind of world. But why should the next generation go through it.""

""I had always believed and said that the next generation should not live through the sounds of gunfire and the smell of explosives. In the ultimate analysis, however, it is the young boys (Kashmiri's) who are suffering,"" said the Army Chief.

Gen Rawat said ""the idea is to bring peace and whatever is happening in Kashmir, I would like to reach out to all those people who have picked up arms to say that it is in their interest that they come forward and handover their weapons….We will accept surrenders.""

In his last word of caution, Gen Rawat added that the losers otherwise will be the people of Kashmir. ""This is the truth, which the earlier they understand the better it is,"" he said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1737022859942493/?type=3,2017-02-25 10:24:16,1723,28,102,1674,42,1,0,5,1

India today successfully test-fired its interceptor missile off the Odisha coast, achieving a significant milestone in the direction of developing a two-layered Ballistic Missile Defence system.

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully tested an exo-atmospheric missile interception from the Abdul Kalam Island (Wheeler Island) at about 7.45 am, as part of the ballistic missile defence programme.

This ""PDV mission is for engaging the targets in the exo-atmosphere region at an altitude of 100 km of earth's atmosphere"", said a DRDO official.

""Both, the PDV interceptor and the two stage target missile, were successfully engaged,"" he said.

The target was developed for mimicking a hostile ballistic missile approaching from more than 2,000 km away was launched from a ship anchored in the Bay of Bengal.

In an automated operation, radar based detection and tracking system detected and tracked the enemy's ballistic missile at a height of 100km with a direct hit by an interceptor missile, said a top DRDO official.

India has built a double-layered BMD system capable of tracking and destroying hostile missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere. The success of the AAD test will boost India strengthen its position in the exclusive club of US, Russia and Israel.

The first phase BMD system capable of killing enemy missiles fired from 2,000 km away is expected to be inducted in the armed forces soon. Development is on for the second phase anti-ballistic missile defence system, capable of destroying enemy missiles fired from 5,000 km away.

Developed by DRDO, the 7.5-metre tall interceptor is a single stage solid rocket propelled guided missile equipped with an inertial navigation system and an electro-mechanical activator totally under command by the data uplinked from the ground-based radar.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today hinted that India may have successfully developed a 'THAAD-type anti-missile defense system.

Speaking at an election rally at Budaun in Uttar Pradesh today, PM Modi congratulated Indian scientists for developing one of the best missile defence systems at a time when a number of countries, including Pakistan, are busy developing missiles.

PM Modi said that the new system has been successfully developed by Indian scientists and it can destroy any incoming missile at the height of 150 kilometres.

''I want to congratulate Indian scientists,'' he said,

Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is one of the recent addition to the US' anti-ballistic missile arsenal. It has been designed to hit missiles as they dive towards the earth, not when they go up. THAAD can engage with incoming missiles at the maximum altitude of 93 miles above the surface of the Earth.

It seems Indian scientists have also developed a similar anti-missile system, Modi said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1729927390652040/?type=3,2017-02-11 10:37:08,2368,33,133,2304,50,13,1,0,0

The Air Force got Rs 33,555.62 crores under capital head for acquiring Rafale jets besides other ongoing deals like payment for C-17 transport planes.  The 36 Rafale jet deal inked last year is worth over 7.87 billion Euros and India has already paid the first tranche of Rs 10,000 crore. 

An amount of Rs 86,488.01 crore has been earmarked as capital outlay to sustain the ongoing modernisation and acquisition plans of the armed forces.  The revenue budget was also increased to Rs 1,72,773.89 crores to meet the operational costs including fuel consumption, training and other necessary expenditure including salaries. The figure stood at Rs 1,49,051.34 crores last fiscal.  Rs 6,886 crore from last fiscal's capital outlay of Rs 78,586.68 crores remained unspent. 

The Finance Minister hiked the capital outlay by more than ten per cent for 2017-18 to enable the armed forces to upgrade and procure various weapon platforms including submarines, artillery guns, tanks and fighter jets besides other critical projects like ongoing raising of the Mountain Strike Corps to face any challenge from China in the likelihood of war in the mountains in the east and west.

Indian soldier Chandu Chavan, who was recently released by Pakistan after he had strayed into that country in September last year, has said he was brutally tortured and regularly injected with drugs during his four-month captivity.

Chavan (22) revealed this to his family members when they met him after his release at a military hospital in Amritsar on Sunday. His brother Bhushan, who is also an army jawan posted at Jamnagar in Gujarat, his grandfather Dhondhu and sister's husband Chetan Patil met him at the hospital.

Speaking to TOI over the phone, Bhushan said, ""Chandu told us that he was beaten and tortured severely by the Pakistani soldiers during his captivity. They used to inject some drugs into his body regularly. They were quite persistent while trying to get details about his reason for crossing the Line of Control (LoC). Besides, they were trying to get information about the creation of the Indian Army's base along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir."" Bhushan said his brother has multiple injuries on his body, especially on the fingers of his right hand. ""He also has minor injuries on his face and is struggling to walk.

Among the 22 soldiers who were honoured on Republic Day for their roles in the surgical strikes against Pakistan, the top award of the Kirti Chakra, the second-highest peacetime decoration, was conferred upon Major Rohit Suri, who killed four people (terrorists and possibly their Pakistani Army handlers, according to sources) in close combat.

The army today said that the Major was ""the mission leader"" of a team assigned to destroy terrorist staging areas across the Line of Control in Kashmir, and that he blueprinted the top-secret operation after a detailed reconnaissance and analysis of data available on the shortlisted targets in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.

""Major Suri along with his buddy closed in and neutralized two sentries in the open,"" the army said. The Major, who was the commander of a strike team leading the operations from the front, went on to eliminate two other enemies as well.

The surgical strikes were conducted by India on September 29 in retaliation for the deadly attack, weeks earlier, on the Uri army base in Kashmir, where 19 military personnel were killed.

Major Suri's Kirti Chakra was earned by ""warrior ethos, uncanny intelligence gathering skills, devotion beyond the call of duty,"" said the army.

Details of the surgical strikes have so far been kept totally classified. How many soldiers took part has not been publicly shared. A combination of ground forces and para commandos were involved. Army sources said that the soldiers trekked starting at midnight upto two kilometres into Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. They returned before dawn, after killing dozens of terrorists who were planning strikes in major Indian metros.

Now, army sources, offering some information, said that after the troops ""infiltrated"" the areas they were to target, meeting or rendezvous points were established where they were to regroup after the operation was completed. ""Diversionary tactics"" or faking activity in an area to mislead opponents were likely used, they said. After a ""commando base"" was established, the soldiers broke into pre-assigned groups. One isolated and blocked potential escape points for targets, while also cutting off any routes that could have been used for reinforcements for the terrorists. The other group established a ""fire base"" from where rocket-propelled grenades, assault rifles and mortars and missiles could be used. Typically, this sort of group destroys the target after the assault party or first group has gone in, provides backup for the first group, extricates soldiers who need help or may be cornered, and can turn into an alternate assault group, if that becomes necessary.

Major Suri was leading an assault party that silently took out enemy sentries and then launched the full-blown assault on the terrorist target. These soldiers took out terrorists and Pak Army regular handlers. A total of 10 people were killed by Major Suri's team, said sources. After that, he directed the fire base to destroy the terrorist launch pad. Members of his team then met at the ""rendezvous points"" and returned home.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1724103951234384/?type=3,2017-01-30 11:02:27,2117,50,75,2021,67,19,0,10,0

1532031947108253_1723603627951083,"New policy to change the way India prepares for war

The Ministry of Defence has okayed a policy to maintain total military readiness for a minimum of 10 days, indicating the possibility that future conflicts could be short, swift and sudden.

A month ago, on December 30, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, after consulting the armed forces, okayed a policy that says forces should be fully stocked up to last a minimum 10-day intense conflict.
The Vice-Chiefs of the three services have been given adequate fiscal powers to maintain this level of readiness, which has opened up the long held back slow-moving procurements. This includes weapons, ammunition, missiles (launched from land, air or sea) and ensuring all radars are functional. In military parlance, this is called the Minimum Accepted Risk Level (MARL).

As per the operational doctrine, India is required to maintain a war wastage reserve (WWR) of 40 days of 'intense war' and is militarily called the '40-I' level. The '40-I' targets shall be on track as usual but within that, the 10-day intense war benchmarking will be the new normal. It does not mean reducing higher stock levels of most of the other ammunition types, sources said.

The reality is that a '40-I' level is very expensive to maintain. Ammunition being an expendable commodity with a fixed shelf life, maintaining stocks at a full-fledged war requirement level at all times was not a wise move, a senior functionary explained. Wisdom, it was added, lies in maintaining 'optimal' stocks as per security contingencies and having the capacity to ramp up production.

The Army Vice-Chief would have the authority to spend up to Rs 200 crore for ordnance stores (ammunition) in consultation with the internal financial auditor. The Navy Vice-Chief can authorise expenses up to Rs 80 crore to repair ships and submarines. The CAG had in 2015 pointed out the low levels of WWR.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1723603627951083/?type=3,2017-01-29 09:41:55,1099,9,31,1065,21,13,0,0,0

1532031947108253_1722489448062501,"In 2002, India's Fighter Jets Hit Pakistan In A Surgical Strike You've Never Been Told About

It was about 2 am on 31 July, 2002. Flight Lieutenant Rajiv Mishra, a 29-year-old fighter pilot, was woken up at his living quarters at the Ambala Air Force Station. Leave for Srinagar immediately with laser designation equipment, he was told. A transport aircraft was ready and waiting at the base.

He didn't know it then, but he had been drafted for one of the most sensitive missions carried out by the Indian Air Force, the details of which had never been revealed to the outside world, until now.

Mishra flew the Jaguar fighter jet of the Indian Air Force. But that night he had not been woken up to fly. The IAF had recently acquired laser guidance systems from Israel. The technology helped fighter pilots to hit targets accurately once the target has been designated on the system. Mishra was regarded a wizard with the new technology.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

On board the transporter, Mishra and his two colleagues were briefed by the members of the IAF Strike Cell, the elite frontline strike unit of the force, comprising the most skilled fighter pilots and the most lethal aircraft. The mission was stunning — they had to ""light up"" Pakistan positions along the Line of Control — the de facto border. 'Light up' is military talk for designating a target on the laser guidance system. They grasped the implication immediately: Indian fighter jets would lock on and hit the Pakistani positions, something the IAF has rarely done during peace time.

It was a sensitive moment in the fraught India-Pakistan ties. Militants had stormed the Indian Parliament just seven months ago, in December 2001, triggering a massive military mobilization and standoff on both sides of the border and along the Line of Control. India called it Operation Parakram.

BJP's Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister and George Fernandes the defence minister. Between May and June 2002, tensions between India and Pakistan were at its heights, following the Kaluchak massacre in May and a failed mediation effort by Russian president Vladimir Putin.

India's defence apparatus suspected a Kargil-like troop build up situation near a border post in the Kel area in the Kupwara sector. Pakistani troops were raining shells on Indian positions from there. There was a need for strong retaliation.

The initial plan was to send in the India Army to attack the Pakistani positions. But the plan was changed after quick consultation with the then Army Chief, General Sundararajan Padmanabhan. Instead of a ground assault, it was decided to soften Pakistani positions using the IAF before the Special Forces went in.

""Typical cold start doctrine in the Air Force terminology was put in practice. The details of this should remain cold. No one should talk about it. What it was intended for was successful,"" then Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Srinivasapuram Krishnaswamy, told HuffPost India.

This account has been pieced together by speaking with multiple people directly involved with the operation. All of them agreed to speak, following months of persuasion, on the condition of anonymity. The IAF declined to comment, as did Flt Lt Mishra, who is now a retired officer and works as a commercial pilot. Typical for a special operation, this mission carried no name.

""Light It Up""

In the tense summer of 2002, the task of carrying out the strikes fell on the Western Air Command. Fighter aircraft including the French-made Mirage 2000, British-made Jaguar fighters and the Russian MiG-21 were moved to forward bases. While the mission was planned to take off from Srinagar, all forward air bases on the West Border were put on alert to be ready for a potential Pakistan retaliation.

That is when Flt Lt Mishra and two colleagues were tasked with ""lighting up"" the target. Today this can be done using different and more advanced technology. In 2002, it required someone operating from the line of sight of a target to designate it on the laser guidance system. That was going to be the job of the three-men team led by Flt Lt Mishra.

The Half Hour Wait

On the night of 31, senior officials met for the last time at Srinagar go over the details. New Delhi was informed after all ends were tied up. The team was told to wait. Nearly half hour later, the message came back--it was green.

On first light, the team was air lifted from the Srinagar airport on 1 August. Doors of the single-engine Cheetah helicopter had been removed. They would soon find out why.

As the helicopter neared the LoC, they could hear the blasts from the incessant shelling underway. They flew low, close to the ground. When they neared a BSF post just on the LoC, the three men jumped. Their equipment was dropped from the helicopter, and was grabbed by two BSF soldiers. They immediately had to duck into a foxhole. Shells landed on the post even as the Cheetah swiftly moved away.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The IAF fighters had to climb three mountains before they could get close enough to the targets to designate them. They were operating at an altitude of 16,000 feet, with rarefied air, making breathing difficult.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Missing Camouflage

The Pakistani positions were on an incline and covered with heavy foliage; it was impossible to light up the targets from a distance. They had to go closer. This eventuality had not been accounted for. This meant the IAF men didn't have any camouflage on them. If they walked from the BSF post further, they would be artillery fodder in minutes, because the helicopter movement would have alerted the Pakistani posts.

Time was ticking away — the operations could commence only after the targets had been well identified. They managed to source two camouflage jackets from the BSF post but the three men decided to march on anyway. On the way, they found trees splattered with blood. The night before, the Indian Army had foiled an infiltration bid. The bloodstains on the trees were that of the infiltrating terrorists.

The IAF team had to climb three mountains before they could get close enough to the targets to designate them. They were operating at an altitude of 16,000 feet, with rarefied air, making breathing difficult. Finally after much effort they could close enough to identify and designate the targets on the laser guidance system. Once the job was done, they fell back to a post that was jointly manned by the BSF and the Indian Army.

The Gathering Force

As Ft Lt Mishra and his two colleagues waited in a darkened bunker, Indian Army's Special Forces started moving into the post. Pakistani guns were in full flow. The only lantern in the bunker had been covered with black paper and put underneath a cot. Even a flicker of light would attract shells. Nonetheless, a Major of the Artillery Unit was calculating the Pakistani gun positions and relaying it back.

2 August 2002

As Ft Lt Mishra, his colleagues and the Special Forces waited, a bit of bad news came in--fighter jets weren't being able to take-off because of bad weather. As Pakistan continued to pound Indian posts, everyone dug in. The final assault was pushed back twice. Finally, at 1:30 pm on 2 August, the code came through. The fighters had taken off and the assault had begun.

Mirage-2000 fighters dipped over the horizon, locked on the laser beams and bombed the Pakistani bunkers in the Kel area in Kupwara sector. Due to the sensitive nature of the operation, we are withholding the number of aircraft used in operation and the exact location where the strike took place. The Pakistani bunkers were reduced to rubble. The casualties are unknown.

Shocked by the surprise air raid, the Pakistanis were quick to take counter-measures to confuse the second wave of fighter jets. Left with no option, The IAF team would break radio silence and communicate to the incoming fighters. They directed them correctly. Pakistan would open up its heavy artillery guns--this time to target the Army-BSF post on the LoC where they had taken refuge.

Ft Lt Mishra and his team would soon begin their long trek back to safety as the Indian Army's Special Forces moved in to eliminate any remaining Pakistani soldiers. By evening the Pakistani guns had fallen silent.

Pakistan never retaliated to the 2002 air strikes. The Vajpayee-led NDA government at the time was happy to keep the strikes under wraps. That the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army were deployed to destroy Pakistan's military capabilities remained known all these years to just a handful of people in the political and civilian leadership, apart from those involved in the operation.

Flt Lt Mishra retired from the IAF as a Wing Commander.

Tucked away in the remote hills of south Kashmir, it is jubilation all around at the Rashtriya Rifles unit as three of its personnel have been awarded Sena Medal for having gunned down dreaded militant commander Burhan Wani whose killing plunged the valley into a welter of violence that lasted for months. 

As details of the July 8 operation last year emerge, it transpires that young Major Sandeep Kumar, who led the crack team following ""actionable"" intelligence input that Sartaj Aziz and two other militants were hiding in a house in Bumdoora village, showed nerves of steel and exemplary restraint in the face of extreme provocation in neutralising them.

The village, 18 km southeast of Anantnag, was cordoned off but the news of Army's presence got leaked, making their task all the more daunting.

It was a long wait for Major Kumar, Captain Manik Sharma and Naik Arvind Singh Chauhan before they could lead their team in storming the house where the militants were holed up.

Protesting crowds began swelling by the minute, shouting slogans and pelting the Army contingent with stones.

Leading the assault team, Captain Sharma and two others even made an attempt to enter the house as Major Kumar stood behind them, ready to provide cover fire. However, they had to retreat amid heavy stone-pelting by the villagers.

""We were counting every minute and even planning to throw a cordon around the house as dusk approached fast and with it the milling, restive crowd carrying stones,"" recalled a police officer who was in touch with the Army contingent from the district headquarters.
Major Kumar and his team made another attempt to storm the house and the militants opened a burst of gunfire.

Aziz made an unsuccessful attempt to escape, but was shot dead.
Time was running fast and two more militants, who were believed to be inside, were to be accounted for.

As violent protests grew more and more intense, Major Kumar sent for the local 'Imam' whose services were to be used to calm the villagers.

With light fading away fast, there were no signs of villagers' aggression or numbers diminishing.

The valiant Major and his men then decided to storm the house but came under a hail of fire from two militants who attempted to escape.

Militant Pervaiz Ahmad Lashkari was seen firing while shielding a man and pushing him towards a nearby apple orchard. Lashkari was gunned down in retaliatory fire by the crack team, which also challenged the lone surviving militant. He, too, was soon sprawled on the floor, dead.

It was later discovered that the last militant killed was Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, the poster boy of resurgent militancy in the Kashmir valley who carried a bounty of Rs 10 lakh on his head.

A day later, the Kashmir valley was gripped by turmoil which lasted months and left a trail of destruction, claiming scores of lives and maiming many more.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1721993751445404/?type=3,2017-01-26 08:24:22,3309,54,115,3195,91,20,3,0,0

The purchases amount to more than $3 billion, persons close to the development said, asking not to be named. Deliveries have begun even as new orders are still being placed.

The shopping from Russia and Israel is ongoing even as deliveries have begun.

Top sources in the government confirmed that two separate teams of an ""empowered committee"" led by senior officials were rushed to Russia and Israel towards the close of 2016 to make these ""off-the-shelf purchases""—a procedure of buying resorted to only when there is an emergency. Empowered committees can take on-the-spot decisions to buy and negotiate prices, cutting down lengthy negotiation processes.

From Russia, India has bought a few thousand anti-tank guided missiles, several T-90 tank engines and critical tank components. The Russia-made T-90 is the Indian Army's mainstay battle tank. The Russia list also includes multi-barrel rocket launchers that operate with the artillery against advancing columns and soft skinned targets, and large quantity of various kinds of ammunition.

Last week, the power of the social media struck the Indian Army with a sort of vengeance. Starting with the 'watery dal' episode, video after video appeared of jawans accusing their officers of all kinds of dishonest and belittling behaviour. Media channels jumped in with enthusiasm as they brought in retired jawans to spew venom against a retired Chief of Army Staff. Having recently hung up my uniform, I watched bewildered as media discussions made it known to us, that as officers we had not understood how Dal, Chai, Sahayaks and boot polishing were critical elements of the military character.
What about what I have seen and experienced in my 40 years of service? The ethos where officers and men share everything together? The captain who lives, sleeps and eats with his soldiers. He leads patrols and ambushes and dies at their head. He is the first person to step into the dark corridor of the EDI Pampore building, and die in a burst of terrorist fire. Undeterred, the second young officer does the same, and dies.
The commanding officer of a Rashtriya Rifles unit, Colonel Santosh Yashwant Mahadik, is killed while leading his men in an operation in North Kashmir. His wife Swati Mahadik decides to continue his legacy. Nine years overage, she seeks exemption, leaves her young children behind and joins as a cadet in OTA.
Nobody has seen more sacrifices than we have. A JCO and soldier rush into a volley of AK 47 bullets to rescue an injured comrade. The soldier is martyred and the JCO is today in R&R Hospital, paralysed below the waist. These are stories which define our character.
We have great and motivated soldiers because we genuinely care for them. Their food, comfort and welfare is our primary concern. Army life is very, very tough. In Kargil, a soldier walks up to his 19,000 feet-high post in November, gets snowed under, and comes down only in the month of May next year. In these six months he battles the most treacherous of conditions – 40 feet snow, -40 degree temperature – and the huge sense of isolation. We make sure that he remains motivated and comes down in good shape because he is the most valuable asset of our Army and we need him.
Military virtues and values are an indispensable part of our lives because without them, the Army will be unable to function. General John Hackett, in his book The Profession of Arms, has put it very appropriately that military virtues ""include such qualities as courage, fortitude and loyalty. What is important about such qualities… is that they acquire in the military context, in addition to their moral significance, a functional significance as well... Thus while you may indeed hope to meet these virtues in every walk of life… in the profession of arms they are functionally indispensable. The program, the group organizations, the whole pattern of life of the professional man-at-arms is designed in a deliberate effort to foster them, not just because they are morally desirable in themselves, but because they are essential to military efficiency.""
The media story, after having made its TRPs, will disappear into a cloud of Jallikattu. Let it not scar our character. There is no real need for senior leadership to personally monitor routine administrative issues. It will only encourage more Tej Bahadur Yadavs. I am not suggesting that there are no problem areas, but let these be handled at the appropriate level of leadership. Our young officers have done us proud in looking after the needs of our soldiers. Let us also assure the citizens of the country that the organisation is stronger than a few individuals. Have faith in it.

1532031947108253_1716025675375545,"Delay in wing deployment caused Nirbhay missile's failure.

The malfunctioning of the mechanism that deploys the wing causing a slight 'pause' during the process, appears to have resulted in the missile developing a very high roll-rate, which led to the Inertial Navigation System (INS) losing its frame of reference. This caused the missile to veer away from its intended flight path, leading to a situation which called for aborting the mission from safety considerations.
Sources within the DRDO, who reviewed the video footage of the missile's failed flight, confirmed that the wing is normally deployed in less than 500 milliseconds (0.5 sec.) after booster burn-out and separation of the booster section from the main missile.
""In the previous missions, we have been achieving the wing deployment in around 300-350 milli-seconds. This time the wing seems to have got stuck at 60 degrees position for about 1.5 seconds causing the damage. This is what we have assessed so far. The missile appears to have developed the high roll rate due to the partially deployed wing"", an official said.
During the vertical launch of the missile the booster fires for about 10 seconds, resulting in the missile gaining height and acceleration. It is in this phase that the Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system rotates the missile from vertical to horizontal attitude. On burn-out of the booster, the booster section is detached from the main missile by activation of pyro-bolts. Small thrusters ensure that the detached section separates safely from the main missile.
The Onboard Computer (OBC), which manages all these critical events, initiates the wing deployment process after separation of the booster section. After wing deployment, the cruise phase engine is started, which takes about six seconds to develop the operational speed (RPM) and thrust required to sustain the flight of the missile.
""At this point the control system puts the missile through a constant altitude phase for a short duration before initiating the pre-programmed way-point navigation phase of the mission,"" says the official.
One Perfect Mission And Three Misses So Far:
During the first launch of Nirbhay, the output from one of the sensors of the INS froze for a short duration. Though a redundant sensor was available, the navigation system lost its reference and the missile deviated from its intended flight path. After about 15 minutes of flight from 'range safety considerations,' the mission had to be aborted by destroying the missile.
The second launch of the missile was a success and the missile traveled for about 72 minutes covering around 1,050 km, meeting all mission objectives.
The third mission again failed owing to a malfunction of the control system. Incidentally, it is understood from reliable sources that the particular system had indicated a problem during the pre-launch checks, during the countdown. The launch was delayed by a few hours, and the system was cleared when it was seen to be working after some investigation.
""The missile went through the launch phase, but the control system failed during the flight. This probably points to avoidable haste in clearing the system and inadequate implementation of quality standards and procedures,"" says the official. He said the DRDO is working on a digital controller for the actuator to replace the control box which caused the failure.
During the fourth recent flight, the wing appears to have rubbed against a supporting bush and was held in that position for a short duration of time, which caused a pause in the deployment process. ""The video from the 4th flight and the telemetry data clearly show the pause,"" says the official.
Sources say there could be flaws in the details of design implementation. With most of the components being 'fabricated' in small numbers, rather than being 'manufactured' in larger quantities, there are quality concerns as well.
""The chaltha-hain attitude of those at the assembly lines after some initial success, is also a cause of worry,"" says the official.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1716025675375545/?type=3,2017-01-14 11:18:06,1565,18,68,1512,23,5,0,25,0

After inviting global manufacturers to supply night sights for LMGs and driver's night sight with fusion technology for T-90 tanks, the Indian Army is now beefing up the night fighting capabilities of its foot soldiers.
The army will place request for information (RFI) for the purchase of 15,000 night vision devices (NVDs) for rocket launchers, 5,000 NVDs for medium machine guns and more than 125,000 for other small handheld arms.
Beginning this month, the Indian Army has already invited global bids for NVDs for long range LMGs and Uncooled Thermal Imager based Driver's Night Sight with fusion technology for the Russian-origin T-90 tanks. The Army requires the range of detection of a human target at minimum 1000 meters.
The 1,000-meters rang is crucial in the mountainous Himalayan region where life of soldiers posted within visual range remains at stake especially on the border with Pakistan.

The Army is moving a classified proposal worth around Rs 300 crore to buy new assault rifles, sniper rifles, general purpose machine guns and light weight rocket launchers and night vision devices at a key Defence Ministry meeting planned next week.

""The old units like the 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 21 Para (SF) have adequate rifles and equipment for performing their tasks but the new raisings such as the 11 and 12 Para (SF) are facing shortages of assault rifles and other equipment. The older units had to dig deep into their reserve equipment to help the new ones,"" as per sources.

The Army has plans of buying around 10,000 free-fall parachutes, 1100 personal automatic rifles, 30-each sniper rifles, and automatic General Purpose Machine Guns, 24 lightweight rocket launchers, 20 shotguns and 500 pistols.

""The GPMGs are a must and its requirement was deeply felt in both the surgical strikes in Myanmar and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir for effect.""

The Special Forces are also keen on getting new assault rifles as the Israeli Tavors are good but the firepower of the 5.56mm bullets is not that effective and in Indian conditions with the hardcore terrorists operating here, bullets which can cause fatal hits are required. 

The rocket launchers sought by the Special Forces are light weight and will be easier to carry inside enemy territory, in case of future strikes against terrorist launchpads. The troops are at present using the Carl Gustaf rocket launchers which were procured long time back by the Army. The Automatic grenade launchers are also required by the Special Forces for taking down a group of terrorists or their hideouts during operations by the forces.
The Special Forces presently have an outdated version of this equipment which is quite heavy.

After the September 28 surgical strikes, the defence Ministry has given a go ahead to the three services with a purse of Rs2,000 crore to buy the equipment and weapon systems which are short in their inventory.

IndianArmy is full of stories of heroism and valor. One such story is that of ""Badluram"" of the Assam Regiment; an Infantry regiment of the Indian army.  ""Badluram ka badan Zamin ke neeche hai….aur humko uska ration milta hai…"" (Badluram's body is buried but we draw his ration) goes the regimental song. The legend of the song is based on a true story. Badluram was a soldier who died in the World War II. His Quarter Master was apparently 'smart'  and continued to draw rations on the jawan's name.The surplus ration that collected in the name of Badluram over the months proved to be a godsend when the regiment was surrounded by the Japanese and cut off from supplies. The regiment survived the siege thanks to Badluram's ration and averted a possibly disastrous fate that could have resulted in many deaths goes the story.Every passing out ceremony of young recruits at  Shillong features a rousing, inspiring rendition of Badluram ka Badan; a thoroughly enjoyable and morale uplifting performance. Watch a more informal rendition of song below with a great deal of clapping, whistling and foot stomping enjoyment.","ASSAM REGIMENT AND THE LEGEND OF "" BADLURAM KA BADAN""",video,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/videos/1691630707815042/,2016-11-25 10:41:32,1463,43,460,1356,71,36,0,0,0

1532031947108253_1673390499639063,"Don't forget the heroes of Rezang La #IndianArmy

On November 18, exactly forty-seven years ago in 1962, 114 brave men of the 13th Kumaon Regiment's Charlie company made the supreme sacrifice fighting the invading Chinese at Rezang La pass at 16000 feet near Chushul. This epic battle called the 'last stand' when every soldier fought to his last breath was led by the legendary Major Shaitan Singh Bhati (IC 7990) of Jodhpur Rajasthan, who was later awarded the Param Veer Chakra, India's highest gallantry award for conspicuous bravery or self sacrifice in the face of the enemy.

Charlie Company of 13 Kumaon was tasked with the defence of Rezang La, situated on the South East approach to the valley, town and airfield of Chushul in Ladakh. The Company area was defended by three platoon positions but the surrounding terrain isolated it from the rest of the Regiment. Their defensive positions were 'crested' for Indian artillery, meaning, thereby that these troops could not hope for artillery fire support if and when needed as the artillery was behind a hill feature and could not train its guns on the target. The Chinese suffered no such disadvantage and brought on heavy artillery fire on the 13 Kumaon's Charlie Company.

""It was a cold winter morning at 16000 feet with icy winds howling through Rezang La … biting and benumbing."" The expected Chinese attack came through a 'Nullah', a dry river bed, but was repulsed with heavy machine gun fire by the brave Ahirs of Charlie Company. The enemy regrouped and attacked again and again with ever more reinforcements and finally managed to overrun the position. 109 of the 123 Jawans (soldiers) were killed. Of the 14 survivors, nine were seriously wounded. Almost everyone had fought to the last round and killed many more enemy soldiers. One estimate of Chinese casualties is close to 1700 killed and wounded.

Unmindful of own safety, Major Shaitan Singh, the Company Commander, went from post to post raising the morale of his men and continued to fight even after being seriously wounded. ""While he was being evacuated by two of his comrades, the Chinese brought heavy machine gun fire on them. Major Shaitan Singh sensed danger to their lives and ordered them to leave him to his fate."" They placed him behind a boulder on the slopes of a hill, where he breathed his last and this is where he was found some days after the battle.

Maj. Gen. Ian Cardozo, himself a Vir Chakra winner, writes in his Param Vir Chakra, Our heroes in Battle, that ""When Rezang La was later revisited dead Jawans were found in the trenches still holding on to their weapons ... every single man of this company was found dead in his trench with several bullet or splinter wounds. The 2-inch mortar man died with a bomb still in his hand. The medical orderly had a syringe and bandage in his hands when the Chinese bullet hit him... Of the thousand mortar bombs with the defenders all but seven had been fired and the rest were ready to be fired when the (mortar) section was overrun"".

Major Shaitan Singh was the second winner of the Param Veer Chakra; the first being Major Som Nath Sharma who had died on November 3, 1947 defending Srinagar airport when Pakistan invaded Jammu & Kashmir in October 1947. Both Singh and Sharma belonged to the Kumaon Regiment.

Other heroes defending Rezang La who were awarded Veer Chakras were Naik Hukum Chand (posthumous), Naik Gulab Singh Yadav, Lance Naik Ram Singh (posthumous), Subedar Ram Kumar and Subedar Ram Chander. All hailed from the Revari district of Haryana where in Gudiani village stands a memorial for these brave sons of India.

Two of the most celebrated soldiers of the Kumaon Regiment, General K.S. Thimayya and General T.N. Raina who served as Chiefs of the Indian Army, have lauded this singular achievement. Thimayya noted: ""I had said many years ago that the Army must have an Ahir Regiment. The supreme sacrifice of the Charlie Company has fulfilled my expectations. I hope a suitable memorial will be built in Ahirwal in their memory so that the generations to come may seek inspiration from the immense courage and valour of their forefathers."" For his part, observed: ""You rarely come across such example in the annals of world military history when braving such heavy odds, the men fought till the last bullet and the last man .Certainly the Battle of Rezang La is such a shining example.""

1532031947108253_1640269929617787,"MHA Advisory: We must honour our Tricolour so please avoid plastic made National Flag, display paper flags, dispose with dignity:

Ahead of the Independence Day, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an Advisory to the Chief Secretaries / Administrators of all State Governments / UT Administrations, Secretaries of all Ministries / Departments of Govt. of India to ensure strict compliance of the provisions contained in the 'Flag Code of India. 2002' and 'The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971'. The Advisory directs that mass awareness programmes be carried out in this regard and also give wide publicity through advertisements in the electronic and print media.

The Advisory states that on important national, cultural and sports events, Flags made of paper only are used by public in terms of the provisions of the 'Flag Code of India, 2002' and such paper Flags are not discarded or thrown on the ground after the event. Such Flags are to be disposed of, in private, consistent with the dignity of the Flag. Wide publicity, for not using the National Flag made of plastic, should be made along with its advertisement in the electronic and print media.

Further, it has been brought to notice of the MHA that on important events the National Flags made of plastic are also being used in place of paper Flags. Since plastic flags are not biodegradable like paper flags, these do not get decomposed for a long time and ensuring appropriate disposal of National Flags made of plastic commensurate with dignity of the flag, is a practical problem. It may also be noted that as per Section 2 of 'The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971'- Whoever in any public place or in any other place within public view bums, mutilates, defaces, defiles, disfigures, destroys, tramples upon or otherwise shows disrespect to or brings into contempt (whether by words, either spoken or written, or by acts) the Indian National Flag or any part thereof, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine, or with both.

The Advisory reiterates that the National Flag represents the hopes and aspirations of the people of our country and hence should occupy a position of honour. There is universal affection and respect for, and loyalty to, the National Flag. Yet, a perceptible lack of awareness is often noticed amongst people as well as organizations/agencies of the Government in regard to laws, practices and conventions that apply to display of the National Flag. A copy each of 'The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971' and 'Flag Code of India, 2002' which governs display of National Flag, are available on the links below for strict compliance of the provisions contained in the Act and the Flag Code (copy also available on this Ministry's website www.mha.nic.in).

Lt Gen KJ Singh returned 'home' to the unit where he was commissioned and spent his final day in uniform with the vintage war machine, the classic T-55 tank, marked as ZX 1685.
Relinquishing his appointment as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Chandimandir-based Western Command, Lt Gen KJ Singh bade a befitting 'farewell to arms' by returning to his first love — 63 Cavalry Garages. He was received by Col Manbir Singh Hundal (retd), who was the very person to receive him when he joined the regiment at Ambala back in 1977.
Reminiscing the golden days of his service, he said that the Army is one of the noblest professions and should attract the best talent in the nation.
""I feel happy that I put more than 39 years in the service of my nation. My association with the Army began way back when I joined Sainik School in 1966 in the aftermath of the 1965 war. I feel people should support their Army in all respects."" He also mounted the ZX 1685, the very battle tank that he maintained with elan as its driver as part of the battle crew.
He had taken charge of the Western Command on August 1, 2014 and was instrumental in giving an impetus to the operational preparedness with new concepts to ensure a decisive victory. He steered the establishment of senior veterans home in Panchkula and Youth outreach programme to motivate youth to join the Army, something, he says, he would continue to do.
""I feel honoured to have been offered the Maharaja Ranjit Singh Chair by Panjab University. I will ensure that I keep myself engaged in inspiring youngsters to join the Indian armed forces,"" he said. He has served in counter-insurgency areas and also had a stint with the UN in Angola for which he was awarded Force Commanders Citation for Bravery followed by COAS commendation card. Accompanied by his wife Anita Singh and other family members, he said that he planned to settle down in Chandigarh.
Popularly known as 'Soldiers' General"", he would always be available for his officers and soldiers, said his wife. ""He is a soldier and will always be one.

Taking on Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for describing Kashmir as 'unfinished agenda' of the United Nations, Minister of State in Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Jitendra Singh on Thursday said India's only unfinished agenda with Islamabad is to retrieve the part of Jammu and Kashmir, which continues to be illegally occupied even after 68 years of partition.
Stating that India's position has always been very consistent and clear, Singh said: ""As far as India is concerned, with regard to Jammu and Kashmir the only unfinished agenda with Pakistan is as to how to retrieve the part of Jammu and Kashmir which continues to remain under illegally occupation of Pakistan even after 68 years of partition and independence.""
""And that is also the position stated in the unanimously passed resolution of the Parliament in 1994,"" he told ANI.
Singh's remark came as the Pakistan Prime Minister has vowed to raise this issue at every international platform and provide all sort of support to the Kashmiris.

Former chairman of India's Joint Intelligence Committee and ex-deputy national security advisor Dr SD Pradhan has made a sensational revelation regarding the killing of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden by the US Navy SEALs.

Speaking exclusively to IBNKhabar, Pradhan said the US and India exchange intelligence at times.

While the US has shared information with India regarding Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence's nefarious plans many times, New Delhi has also exchanged intelligence on terrorists with Washington.

In 2006-07, two important meetings took place in Pakistan. The meetings were attended by the then al Qaeda No 2 Al Zawahiri and bin Laden's confidante Mullah Omar. After the meetings, both the men used to travel to Rawalpindi and vanish in thin air.

The Indian security officials had then suspected that bin Laden's hideout could be near Rawalpindi. ""We shared the information with the US and there is a big possibility that they worked on the lead and carried out the raid to kill the former boss of al Qaeda,"" said Pradhan.

The ex-Intelligence officer further revealed that the US knows about Pakistan's dubious role in the fight against terror, but due to the strategic interest in Afghanistan, it doesn't take any action.

The US had alerted Indian security agencies about 2007 Samjhauta Express blast, he said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1633382040306576/?type=3,2016-07-29 00:49:11,25,1,4,25,0,0,0,0,0

According to a report prepared by Financial Express , after Lockheed Martin failed to create Indian interest in their legacy F-16 fighter jets , is currently preparing to offer its latest 5th generation F-35A to Indian Air force to meet its requirements for 90 combat fighter jets above 36 Rafale fighter jets currently been negotiated with France . The report also mentions that India has officially turned down "" Make in India "" F-16 offer from Lockheed Martin and is currently going through proposals submitted by Swedish SAAB for their Gripen E and American Boeing's F-18s combat fighter jets with Transfer of Technology to be made in India . F-35A reported per unit cost is 98$ million with additional funds required for weapons ,spares and training support . Defence analyst close to idrw.org do not believe Lockheed Martin will offer Transfer of Technology (TOT) nor will agree to Make it in India , most likely it will offer to establish local supply chain in India for its maintenance and components but it is unlikely to see any interest in India's Defence ministry . India is already negotiating with Russia for the development of 5t generation FGFA based on Sukhoi's T-50 design and has committed to contribute 4 $ Billion each in its development with committed orders for 114 units of this Indo-Russia developed 5th generation Heavy Class fighter which will be slotted above current Air superiority fighter jets like Sukhoi-30 MKI . India also plans to kickstart its own 5th generation multirole fighter jet programme AMCA by the end of this year for which Defence ministry and various Aerospace developmental and production agencies in India are waiting for official clearance to the project from the government with project budget allocation, timelines and collaborations to be cleared soon .

#MustWatch
IndianArmy is full of stories of heroism and valor. One such story is that of ""Badluram"" of the Assam Regiment; an Infantry regiment of the Indian army.  ""Badluram ka badan Zamin ke neeche hai….aur humko uska ration milta hai…"" (Badluram's body is buried but we draw his ration) goes the regimental song. The legend of the song is based on a true story. Badluram was a soldier who died in the World War II. His Quarter Master was apparently 'smart'  and continued to draw rations on the jawan's name.The surplus ration that collected in the name of Badluram over the months proved to be a godsend when the regiment was surrounded by the Japanese and cut off from supplies. The regiment survived the siege thanks to Badluram's ration and averted a possibly disastrous fate that could have resulted in many deaths goes the story.Every passing out ceremony of young recruits at  Shillong features a rousing, inspiring rendition of Badluram ka Badan; a thoroughly enjoyable and morale uplifting performance.

1532031947108253_1627665484211565,"India is pushing for a final discount of nearly 1,50,000 Euros in the much-anticipated Rafale fighter jet deal with France even after successfully bringing down the price by nearly two billion Euros. The French side, however, is adamant on the price it had offered way back in April which comes to about 7.89 billion Euros for the 36 fighter jets in fly away conditions, defence sources said. The price was brought down from nearly 10 billion Euros, as sought initially, due to various reasons, including the discount offered by the French government and reworking of some of the criteria.
The Indian side is now directly negotiating with the French Embassy here rather than the negotiating team, which used to fly down from Paris, as talks are more focussed on price rather than other areas.
""There is a limit till which France can really come down to,"" a defence source said, adding that the deal is finally set to be inked. Defence minister Manohar Parrikar has made it clear that he will bargain for discount to get the best deal for the aircraft which will come as a boost to the depleting strength of the Indian Air Force.
The deal will be signed once the file moves from the defence ministry to the finance and then to the cabinet committee on security.
The deal is unlikely to face bureaucratic delay as the government is keen on getting the fighter jets for IAF. The deal comes with the clause of delivering 50 per cent offsets, creating business worth at least 3 billion Euros for smaller Indian companies and creating thousands of new jobs in India through the offsets.
The toughest phase in the negotiations that began in July 2015 - three months after Prime Minister Modi announced in Paris India's plan to purchase 36 Rafale jets - was to get France to agree to 50 per cent offsets in the deal. Initially, Dassault Aviation, the maker of the combat planes, was willing to agree to reinvest only 30 per cent of the value of its contract in Indian entities to meet the offset obligations. The French side finally agreed to invest 50 per cent of the value following a phone conversation between Modi and French President Francois Hollande late last year. France has offered to help India revive the unsuccessful Kaveri engine project for indigenous Tejas aircraft and in a host of other high-end collaboration as part of the offsets in the deal.
The French side has made a 30 per cent offset commitment for military aerospace research and development programmes and the rest 20 per cent for making components of Rafales here. The offsets will be carried out by French companies Safran, Thales, MBDA and Dassault, all part of the Rafale project.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1627665484211565/?type=3,2016-07-16 00:52:22,12,0,2,11,0,1,0,0,0

Reports that at least two of the Dhaka attackers were following Wahabi tele-evangelist Zakir Naik wasn't a bolt from the blue. That his quasi scientific sermons, laced with a heavy dose of Quranic verses, followed by his understanding of them, is leading to people taking up violence does not come as a surprise either. Years ago he was banned from visiting the United Kingdom and subsequently from Canada. Even in Malaysian states, his talks have been cancelled for fearthat they could instigate inter-racial tensions.
A petition on Change.org, which demands that Naik's Islamic Research Foundation be declared as a terrorist organisation lists other instances including how CDs of his speeches were recovered from the operatives of the Indian Mujahideen, or even how investigations in the 26/11 Mumbai attack have found Islamic Research Foundation(IRF)[ organisation of Dr. Zakir Naik ] contacts during the David Headley's Mumbai days.
Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju had on Wednesday told reporters in Delhi that, ""Zakir Naik's speech is a matter of concern for us. Our agencies are working on this. But as a minister, I will not comment what action will be taken.""

1532031947108253_1619136055064508,"India is Larger Than the NSG
By RSN Singh
It is unfortunate that a segment of the media as well as some political commentators, and 'experts', have issued comments on the NSG issue, unsavory to India's interest. In effect they seek to bloat China's ego and put down India. To cite some of these disparaging comments and headlines:-
The pro-China constituency in India survives in many manifestations, in parliament, academia, think-tanks and universities. It is for this reason that China's anti-India posturing at the NSG did not evoke the expected anger.
No entry in NSG: India blames one country(China) others said no too
India's NSG bid runs into a great wall.
Opposition parties slam Modi over India not getting NSG membership.
Modi failed on foreign policy.
Modi's effort to get entry into NSG failed.
Rival Party takes a dig, calls NSG bid a failed diplomacy.
What can be inferred from these comments and headlines is the subterranean import that behemoths China and dwarfs India. It is not a new phenomenon. This pro-China lobby, and communists have always been dwarfing India vis-à-vis China even when China was an impoverished, brutalized and underdeveloped country under Mao for at least four decades. This constituency, it may be recalled, had made arrangements to welcome the Chinese into India's eastern hinterland during the 1962 war. Despite such blatant subversion these elements flourished with their politics. VK Krishna Menon, one of the key culprits responsible for India's humiliation in 1962 war hardly suffered any ignominy. He was elected to the Lok Sabha with the help of the communists in 1969 and then in 1971 from Midnapore (West Bengal) and Trivandrum (Kerala) respectively. The pro-China constituency in India survives in many manifestations, in parliament, academia, think-tanks and universities. It is for this reason that China's anti-India posturing at the NSG did not evoke the expected anger.
Those blaming the Indian establishment for India's unsuccessful bid to enter the NSG are victims of selective amnesia. In the '50s and '60s, we abandoned Tibet and Taiwan, thus forgoing the most important strategic leverages. During the same period, we surrendered our chances to be the permanent member of the UN Security Council. Also, we spurned the American offer to conduct nuclear tests before 'communist' China did. One of the most respected former diplomats of India, an octogenarian, Mr MK Rasgotra, during the recent launch of his book 'A Life in Diplomacy' said that if Nehru had accepted the offer, not only would have India tested the nuclear device first in Asia, before China, but it also would have deterred China from launching its war of 1962 and even imparted a note of caution to (Pakistan's) Field Marshal Ayub Khan's plans for war in 1965.[1]
Let it not be lost out on anyone that China is inimical to India…It is also true that Pakistan's nuclear programme is as good as a part of China's program. Together Pakistan and China present a two-front situation for India.
The pro-China lobby in India exulting at India's failed effort to enter the NSG must realize that most unbiased and patriotic Indians never viewed the opportunity or occasion as one of 'do or die'. The NSG waiver of 2008 takes care of India's critical interests. If there was some optimism about sitting on the high-table of NSG, it was tempered with caution. None had lost the sense of reality and proportion. China, Pakistan and their patrons in India may exult temporarily, but they need to realize that they may have won this small battle, but have played into a process that will enable India to win the war, in short-term or at worst, mid-term.
Let it not be lost out on anyone that China is inimical to India. It is a geostrategic truism that both Pakistan and China are nuclear capable states. It is also true that Pakistan's nuclear programme is as good as a part of China's program. Together Pakistan and China present a two-front situation for India. There is every reason for China not to allow the capping of Pakistan's nuclear programme by subjecting its 'client state' to any kind of inspection regime. The manipulations of the NSG therefore enable China to perpetuate its nuclear hegemony in Asia through rogue states like Pakistan and North Korea. China's acquiescence to India's entry would have fed into Pakistan's growing insecurity of its own making. This reality was very much factored in when India made its bid.
Nevertheless there was hope and not without reason. The sanguinity was based on the premise that in diplomacy and strategic interlocution, States respond depending on geopolitical imperatives, national interests, leverages and on quid-pro-quo. Blackmail is also very much on the realm of alternatives. Let us not forget that in the year 2008, China did come around to support the one time waiver that allowed nuclear commerce between NSG members and India. The then US President George Bush personally took up the matter with the then Chinese President Hu Jintao and the latter relented because of pressing congruency of economics and strategic imperatives between US and China. Geopolitics by nature is fluid. Powers do exert to achieve 'dominance', they try and avoid any serious 'clash' or in 'locking horns' with inimical powers to avoid unforeseen setbacks. China is no difference as far as this prudence goes. Therefore, the window of opportunity is never closed. It is this window that we were trying to prise open. The result of Indian exertions has only been delayed.
Unfortunately, US support to India at the NSG is seen by China as means to broaden and sharpen India's nuclear teeth.
The evolving geopolitics in Asia has engendered some drastic re-configurations – Afghanistan, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and South China Sea being the catalysts. Strategically, it would not be wrong to infer that the geopolitical developments have generated a new 'great game' between the US and China in Asia and the Asia Pacific Region. The Indian strategic thrust through Chabhar port in Iran into Afghanistan and Central Asia is being construed by China and Pakistan as a strategic challenge to the CPEC. Increasingly, the geopolitical narrative is acquiring the sobriquet of 'Chabhar versus Gwadar'. Various writings in the Pakistani media betray a sense of siege a consequence of the Chabhar project. The Chinese view it as an extension of the US sponsored 'Pivot of Asia' project and a threat to its outreach into the Persian Gulf as well as the 'one belt one road' enterprise. Unfortunately, US support to India at the NSG is seen by China as means to broaden and sharpen India's nuclear teeth.In response China's territorial embrace of Pakistan through the CPEC is likely to be strengthened by a bolstered nuclear partnership.
It was therefore a nervous China that India had to deal with in the run-up to NSG meet at Seoul.
India's bid was not without positive outcomes and long-term benefits. The media in India made a sterling contribution by discussing the issue thread bare. It was able to highlight internationally the 'nuclear delinquency' of proliferator Pakistan and its patron proliferator China. The global attention was drawn to the conflation of Pakistan's nuclear weapons to proxy war. The world was warned about the jihadi component of Pakistan's nuclear programme, raising undying concerns about the security of country's nuclear arsenal. Apart from jihadi organizations, the military, which is in sole charge of Pakistan's nuclear programme is also not trusted. It was this jihadi component that compelled the military to prevent Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from attending the recently held Nuclear Security Summit in the US. The world was warned about the insecurity of Pakistan's arsenal of 120-130 nuclear bombs/warheads, which is growing with the illegal facilitation of China.
Our aggressive bid and emerging geopolitical circumstances in Asia and the Asia Pacific Region will in effect either alter the character of the NSG or cause the redundancy of the grouping.
In the process the NSG, as an institution, has taken severe beating on its image and credibility. Questions are being asked as to how a group formed to regulate nuclear commerce could permit the main proliferators, i.e. China and Pakistan to thwart the membership of a responsible nuclear state like India with impeachable record of non-proliferation. To that extent, China and its client Pakistan have been isolated. Some countries, who switched support to China, have done so because of the economic leverages that the latter has created in the recent past and which evidently China has employed to undertake some blatant arm twisting.
Our aggressive bid has generated new dynamics in the current 'world nuclear order'. Our aggressive bid and emerging geopolitical circumstances in Asia and the Asia Pacific Region will in effect either alter the character of the NSG or cause the redundancy of the grouping. After all, the world nuclear order right from the inception has been riddled with hypocrisies and exceptions.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1619136055064508/?type=3,2016-06-26 04:34:32,6,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0

Final agreement on developing the FGFA between India & Russia is likely to be formalized in the coming days.
India and Russia are set to embark on an ambitious mission to co-develop one of the most advanced Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA).
Indian Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has confirmed that the final agreement on developing the FGFA between India & Russia will be formalized in the coming days.
In an interview with The Tribune newspaper, Parrikar said, ""The Design and Development contract for the fifth generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) with Russia will be signed soon. It will take 8-10 years (for the project to be completed).""
With an approximate cost of $4 billion, the two countries will be working on a FGFA prototype. During the negotiations held in December last year, India and Russia agreed to lower the cost of the project by 40% from the earlier estimate of $5.5 billion.
The Indian Defense Minister also mentioned that three squadrons of Sukhoi Su-30MKI will reach India very soon which will keep the Indian Air Force fully operational. Currently the Indian Air Force has 33 squadrons of fighter jets against an actual need for 42.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1607032422941538/?type=3,2016-05-29 01:35:59,5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0

The MiG-25 broke the sound barrier while flying at an altitude of around 65,000 feet (20,000 m), otherwise the mission would have remained covert, at least to the general public. The Pakistani Government contended that the breaking of the sound barrier was a deliberate attempt to make the point that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had no aircraft in its inventory that could come close to the MiG-25's cruising altitude (up to 74,000 feet (23,000 m))

As the alarms bell rang through the PAF high command over the incursion by an Indian aircraft over their sovereign territory. Radar intercepts confirmed the bogey was making a wide arc in Pakistani airspace as the onboard A-70M camera took photos of Pakistani military and industrial installations including the capital.

The PAF found itself helpless as the Indian MiG-25RBs code named Garuda were untouchable by their interceptors. The Trisonics of the Indian Air force flew too high and too fast for the enemy to do anything about as the photo recce missions continued to cause the PAF sleepless nights.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IndiaDefenseNews/photos/a.1588780734766707.1073741828.1532031947108253/1605967499714697/?type=3,2016-05-26 10:14:19,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0

42739463017_10156010981528018,"From our sports writer Paul Klauda on Sid's return:

On a day when snow snarled the commute and many Minnesotans heeded advice to stay off the roads, almost 97-year-old Sid -- barely three weeks after breaking his hip in a fall -- roared back into the office. 

With a walker. And a personal care provider. And a column to write for Thursday. 

""You have 18,000 bylines in the Star Tribune and we think you need a few more,"" the sports editor told him before a gathering of sports staffers outside his office. ""We're all glad to have you back."" 

Somewhat at a loss for how to mark the occasion, we got him balloons and a cake. There's no script for a comeback like this. Breaking a hip at Sid's age can often start a spiral of other maladies. 

Not so with Sid. Heck, last Friday he got himself to the press conference to announce new Gophers football coach P.J. Fleck. Seated in the front row, he got up afterward and greeted Fleck, as he has every Gopher coach for the last 70 years. 

His caregiver was with him then, too. She's no slouch. After Sid supposedly ragged on her driving (probably, one editor said, for obeying red lights), she pulled over and told Sidney in no uncertain terms that she's cared for people a lot more important than him. Not one of them, she said, had died because of her driving. 

Sid was quiet after that. Some sports department wags figured he was trying to figure out who could be a bigger deal than he was. 

""There's a couple rooms you can go in,"" he told her as he got into his office and seemed concerned about what she would do while he worked. ""You got something to read or something?"" 

Then Sid sat down with his assistant, he dictated his column, and all seemed normal again in the sports department. 

""I really appreciate it,"" Sid had said a few minutes earlier, after getting a round of applause from all of us. ""All you guys have been great to me, and for an old man who can barely make it."" 

""You will,"" someone called out. Sid: ""We'll see what happens.""

42739463017_10153197548968018,"Many of you were moved by the story of Jason, who has brain cancer and has been tending the memorial of slain Mendota Heights police officer Scott Patrick. Our Paul Klauda has this update:

Jason is now providing light to others.

When I met him last week, he was tending to candles at the memorial site where Mendota Heights police officer Scott Patrick was killed. I went back Thursday evening, mostly to convey the magnitude of reaction to a post I did after that visit.

Hundreds of thousands of people saw his story after the Star Tribune, my employer, reposted the picture on its Facebook page. Thousands of ""likes"" and more than 180 comments were left, all of them lauding Jason's simple act of tending to the memorial. 

It was Patrick who had spent 30 minutes talking with Jason last December after giving him a speeding ticket. Jason said he had just left the hospital after learning some bad news related to his cancer.

As the days have taken their toll on the memorial's flowers and candles, Jason's daily visits have turned him into a gardener -- weeding out dead flowers, caring for new ones, seeing to small flags rimming the boulevard site. He leaves the candles, or what's left of them, to evening visitors to light in the darkness.

The light provided by Jason comes when one woman stops by and, after asking ""Are you Jason?"" tells him he's ""the guardian angel"" of the community.  It comes when one of officer Patrick's family members walks up, shakes his hand and spends several minutes talking like neighbors.

And it comes when this woman introduces herself and her son, who also has a brain tumor. They trade details, hopes and tears for several minutes.

""You are an inspiration,"" she tells Jason over and over.

Jason looks at her son, a big teenager who works at a fast-food outlet, smiles and calls him the inspiration.

""It's not about me,"" Jason told me more than once since last week.

""I just want to build community,"" he said, ""with whatever time I have left.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/startribune/photos/a.349517858017.199941.42739463017/10153197548968018/?type=3,2014-08-15 09:37:52,1007,44,127,1007,0,0,0,0,0

Our Paul Klauda asked him why. 

His story: Officer Patrick stopped him for speeding last December as Jason, who has brain cancer, left the hospital. He got a ticket, but also a 30-minute conversation that, in the wake of the officer's death, made him value the preciousness of life just a little bit more. 

Jason plans to be there on Wednesday, tending to the candles when the massive  funeral procession bearing Patrick's flag-draped casket rolls by, escorted by hundreds of police cars. 

Jason said doctors told him he wouldn't live this long. He says he thankful for the chance to help others with whatever time he has left.

Uve Hamilton of St. Paul was visiting her daughter, who lives near Lake Harriet in Minneapolis, when she decided to take a walk along the lake in blizzard-like conditions. At one point Hamilton thought she'd dropped her camera because the blowing snow and wind was so intense she couldn't tell if the camera was still strapped around her coat. Nice day for a walk, though.

Dayton's budget overhaul has taken blistering criticism from lawyers, public relations firms, accountants and IT firms that would have to charge sales tax on their fees if the budget is approved. But the plan would lower state sales tax from 6.875 percent to 5.5 percent on some services and help remedy a patchwork system that favors some businesses over others, often for no apparent reason.

For example, Minnesota sales tax applies to pet grooming but not barber shops, dry cleaners but not coin-operated laundromats, and calls to 1-900 numbers but not dating services. Super Bowl tickets are exempt, but not hockey sticks.

Minnehaha Falls was little more than a drip Thursday. Step into the creek these days and you won't even get your feet wet. With little rain, flow dwindled in late summer, and the dam that lets water from Lake Minnetonka into the creek was closed Aug. 20.

The only source of water for the creek has been rain water that runs off streets or through the ground, and since Aug. 1, Twin Cities rainfall has been about one-fourth normal. The phenomenon is not uncommon. The dam was closed for most of the summer in 2009, and for the entire summer of 2000, when the creek also reverted to a gravel bed.

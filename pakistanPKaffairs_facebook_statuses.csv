Quaid-e-azam did warn Sikh leaders of their unpredictable future in a Hindu majority India.
Sikh leaders got fooled and their demand of a separate Sikh country Khalistan was diminished to just the demand of a Sikh majority province.
Sikh were also poisoned with hate against Muslims, so much so that from August 1947 partition to March 1948 ,the Sikh displaced almost 95% of Muslim Punjabi living among them.
Sikh also went on the rampage and attacked migrating Muslims who inevitably had to pass through Sikh majority areas to enter newly created Pakistan.
The Sikh attacks killed 10,00,000 Muslims, mostly Punjabi Muslims. The killings happened at astonishing intensity so much so that 3 Muslims were killed every minute in the 7 months when British army conducted the survey before leaving in March 1948. Killings and migration continued after that, but no detailed records are available after March 1948.
Sikh didn't get their separate province even after partition and had to struggle another 20 years .
The 1965 war of Pakistan and India prompted Indian government to win support of Sikhs and finally Sikh got a Sikh majority province Indian Punjab which had remained part of another Indian state since 1947.

276691342443057_1120278511417665,"Muslims Were Banned From the Americas as Early as the 16th Century

Long before today's anxiety about terror attacks, Spain and England feared that enslaved Africans would be more susceptible to revolt if they were Muslim

On Christmas Day, 1522, 20 enslaved Muslim Africans used machetes to attack their Christian masters on the island of Hispaniola, then governed by the son of Christopher Columbus. The assailants, condemned to the grinding toil of a Caribbean sugar plantation, killed several Spanish and freed a dozen enslaved Native Americans in what was the first recorded slave revolt in the New World.

The uprising was quickly suppressed, but it prompted the newly crowned Charles V of Spain to exclude from the Americas ""slaves suspected of Islamic leanings."" He blamed the revolt on their radical ideology rather than the harsh realities of living a life of slavery.

By the time of the Hispaniola revolt, Spanish authorities had already forbidden travel by any infidel, whether Muslim, Jewish, or Protestant, to its New World colonies, which at the time included the land that is now the United States. They subjected any potential emigrant with a suspicious background to intense vetting. A person had to prove not just that they were Christian, but that there was no Muslim or Jewish blood among their ancestors. Exceptions were granted solely by the king. Catholic Europe was locked in a fierce struggle with the Ottoman Empire, and Muslims were uniformly labeled as possible security risks. After the uprising, the ban applied even to those enslaved in the New World, writes historian Sylviane Diouf in a study of the African diaspora.

""The decree had little effect,"" adds historian Toby Green in Inquisition: The Reign of Fear. Bribes and forged papers could get Jews to the New World with its greater opportunities. Slave traders largely ignored the order because West Africa Muslims often were more literate and skilled in trades, and therefore more valuable, than their non-Muslim counterparts. Ottoman and North Africans captives from the Mediterranean region, usually called Turks and Moors, respectively, were needed to row Caribbean galleys or perform menial duties for their Spanish overlords in towns and on plantations.

In the strategic port of Cartagena, in what is now Colombia, an estimated half of the city's slave population were transported there illegally and many were Muslim. In 1586, the English privateer Sir Francis Drake besieged and captured the town, instructing his men to treat Frenchmen, Turks, and black Africans with respect. A Spanish source tells us ""especially Moors deserted to the Englishman, as did the blacks of the city."" Presumably they were promised their freedom, although Drake was a notorious slave trader. A Spanish prisoner later related that 300 Indians—mostly women—as well as 200 Africans, Turks, and Moors who were servants or slaves boarded the English fleet. 

En route to the English colony on Roanoke Island, Drake and his fleet raided the small Spanish settlement of St. Augustine, on Florida's Atlantic Coast, and stripped it of its doors, locks and other valuable hardware. With the pirated slaves and stolen goods aboard, Drake intended to bolster Roanoke, situated on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and the first English effort at settling the New World. ""All the Negroes, male and female, the enemy had with him, and certain other equipment which had taken…were to be left at the fort and settlement which they say exists on the coast,"" a Spanish report states.

Drake sought to help his friend, Sir Walter Raleigh, who had settled Roanoke the year prior with more than 100 men and the goal of establishing a base for privateering and extracting the wealth that made Spain the richest and most powerful nation on Earth. Among them was a German metallurgist named Joachim Gans, the first Jewish-born person known to have set foot on American soil. Jews were forbidden to live or even visit England then—the ban lasted from 1290 to 1657—but Raleigh needed scientific expertise that could not be found among the Englishmen of his day. He won for Gans today's equivalent of an H-1B visa so that the accomplished scientist could travel to Roanoke and report on any valuable metals found there. Gans built a workshop there and conducted extensive experiments.

Shortly after Drake's fleet arrived off the Carolina coast, a fierce hurricane pummeled the island and scattered the ships. The English colonists abruptly chose to abandon their battered fort and return home with the fleet. Had the weather been more fortunate, the fragile settlement on Roanoke might have emerged as a remarkably mixed community of Christian, Jewish and Muslim Europeans and Africans, as well as Indians from both South and North America. The Drake fleet returned safely to England, and Elizabeth I returned 100 Ottoman slaves to Istanbul in a bid to win favor with the anti-Spanish sultan.

The fate of the Moors, Africans and the Indians, however, remains an enduring mystery. There is no record of them reaching England. ""Drake thought he was going to find a flourishing colony on Roanoke, so he brought a labor supply,"" says New York University historian Karen Kupperman. She and other historians believe that many of the men and women captured in Cartagena were put ashore after the storm.

Drake was always eager to make a profit from human or material cargo, and not inclined to liberate a valuable commodity, but there was little market in England for enslaved persons. To make room for the Roanoke colonists, he may well have dumped the remaining men and women on the Carolina coast and sailed away. Some of the refugees may have drowned in the hurricane.

Less than a year later, a second wave of English settlers sailed to Roanoke—the famous Lost Colonists--but they made no mention of meeting hundreds of refugees. The Cartagena captives might have scattered among the local Native American population to avoid detection by the slave raiders who prowled the North American coast in the 16th century. The new colonists were themselves abandoned in the New World and never heard from again—including Virginia Dare, the first English child born in America.

The Jamestown settlement that followed adopted a policy similar to that of the Spanish with regards to Muslims. Christian baptism was a requirement for entering the country, even for enslaved Africans, who first arrived in Virginia in 1619. In 1682, the Virginia colony went a step further, ordering that all ""Negroes, Moors, mulattoes or Indians who and whose parentage and native countries are not Christian"" automatically be deemed slaves.

Of course, suppressing ""Islamic leanings"" did little to halt slave insurrections in either Spanish or British America. Escaped slaves in Panama in the 16th century founded their own communities and fought a long guerilla war against Spain. The Haitian slave revolt at the turn of the 19th century was instigated by and for Christianized Africans, although whites depicted those seeking their freedom as irreligious savages. Nat Turner's rebellion in Virginia in 1831 stemmed in part from his visions of Christ granting him authority to battle evil.

The real threat to peace and security, of course, was the system of slavery itself and a Christianity that countenanced it. The problem wasn't the faith of the immigrants, but the injustice that they encountered on their arrival in a new land.

شامی وفد کے سربراہ، اقوام متحدہ میں شام کے سفیر بشار جعفری نے کہا کہ آستان کی ملاقات کی اولین مثبت نتیجہ یہ ہے کہ تمام فریقین نے حتمی اعلامیہ پر اتفاق کر لیا۔ موصوف کے مطابق تمام اختلافات کو تو فورا"" ختم نہیں کیا جا سکتا تاہم جنگ بندی کی نگرانی بحران کو حل کئے جانے کے لیے زمین ہموار کر سکتی ہے۔

شام کی مسلح حزب اختلاف کے وفد کی قیادت کرنے والے، جیش الاسلام کے سیاسی رہنما محمد علوش نے اپنی طرف سے کہا کہ شام میں امن کی بحالی کے عمل میں روس کا کردار بڑھتا جا رہا ہے، انہوں نے اس توقع کا اظہار کیا کہ روس آئندہ بھی شام میں اصل سیاسی عمل کی حمایت کرتے ہوئے مثبت کردارا ادا کرتا رہے گا۔

آستانا کی ملاقات میں روس کے وفد کے سربراہ الیکساندر لاورینتئیو نے اعلان کیا کہ شام میں جنگ بندی کی نگرانی کرنے کی خاطر روس، ایران اور ترکی کی طرف سے تشکیل دیا جانے والا گروپ ماہ فروری کے شروع میں اپنا کام شروع کرے گا۔

روس کی پارلمینٹ کے ایوان بالا کی کمیٹی برائے امور خارجہ کے سربراہ کونستانتین کوساچوو نے آستانا کے مذاکرات کو سراہتے ہوئے کہا: بہت اہم بات یہ ہے کہ دمشق انتظامیہ اور مسلح حزب اختلاف کے نمائندوں کو ایک مذاکراتی میز پر لایا جا سکا ہے بلکہ ایران اور ترکی نے پرامن عمل کے ضامنوں کے طور پر ملاقات میں بڑھ چڑھ کر حصہ لیا۔

موصوف کے مطابق حتمی اعلامیہ میں مسئلہ شام کے حل کے اصولوں کا تذکرہ ہے جن میں شام کی خودمختاری اور علاقائی وحدت کا احترام، بحران کو فوجی طریقے سے حل کئے جانے کو ناممکن قرار دیا جانا اور جنگ بندی کی نگرانی کی خاطر سہ فریقی میکانیزم کا قیام شامل ہے۔

کوساچوو نے زور دے کر کہا کہ یہ ایک بڑی کامیابی ہے جس کا سہرا بڑی حد تک روس کے سفارت کاروں کے سر ہے۔

شامی حکام اور حزب اختلاف کے درمیان مذکرات کا اگلا دور آٹھ فروری کو متوقع ہے، یہ ملاقات اقوام متحدہ کے جھنڈے تلے منظم کی جائے گی۔

276691342443057_1095812823864234,"Pakistan's history of Rocket flying.

Pakistan entered the Space Age, ahead of all Islamic countries, in fact, all developing countries, on 7th June 1962 with a bang, when its first two-stage rocket named REHBAR -1 rose up into the night sky over the Baluchistan Coast, rising to a height of 80 miles, releasing an orange trail of sodium vapour lit up by the rays of the setting sun which could be seen from Karachi and hundreds of miles along the coast of Pakistan. The following is a personal perspective written by Tariq Mustafa,  who led the team which established Pakistan's first rocket range at Sonmiani in Baluchistan in 1962, followed by the subsequent construction of Suparco's Rocket Plant for the indigenous manufacture of such rockets and their propellants in 1967.

SUPARCO - The formative years (1961 - 1967)

 In Mid september 1961 I was posted at the US Atomic Energy Commission Laboratories at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as a US AID fellow from Pakistan, when I received a call from Washington, DC. The person at the other end identified himself as none other than Prof Abdus Salam. He said, ""Look Tariq it might come as a surprise but you have to reach Washington earliest and join me tomorrow morning in an important meeting."" He made it clear that he did not care how I got there, whether by running or hitchhiking, but I better get there soon. So the next morning at 10 am I joined Prof Salam and found ourselves going into the spanking new Headquarters of NASA, the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Agency of America.

Our meeting was with a dynamic young Director of International Relations, Mr. Arnold Frutkin, who came straight to the point after welcoming us and told Professor Abdus Salam that luckily you are accompanying President Ayub Khan who was on an official visit to the USA. And President Kennedy of US had, a short time before, announced that he was committing the US to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth before the decade of the 60s was out. NASA was directed to complete this program and they had already started in real earnest. Mr Frutkin explained that this was a program that would encompass the whole earth because their rockets would have to be placed in Earth's orbit before being propelled towards the moon and this required knowledge of the properties of Earth's upper atmosphere, particularly the wind speeds and directions at the higher levels. He explained that NASA scientists had found that the area around the Indian Ocean was a black hole of data since practically no data was available on the upper atmosphere in this entire region. This was crucial for NASA's program. The British in India had done a good job of collecting meteorological data on the surface up to around 100 feet and the weather balloons could go up to 30,000 ft. or so, but very little was known above that height. Thus NASA had invited selected countries of the region to set up rocket ranges and carry out scientific experiments. The US would supply free launching equipment and rockets in lieu of sharing of raw data obtained from the experiments. He wanted to know if Pakistan would be interested.

Prof Salam looked at me and said in Punjabi, his favourite language, ""Tariq ki khyal ai?"" ('Tariq, what do you think?') I replied to him in Urdu: ""Yeh to jee hamara khwaab pura ho jai ga."" ('This will amount to our dream coming true.') Mr Frutkin who was watching intently, caught on to it at once and said, ""From his face it appears the young man is quite keen, am I right?"" Prof Salam nodded and Frutkin said that in that case we need not lose any time. He suggested that one of NASA's airplane shuttles was leaving Washington National Airport at 1 pm for NASA's Wallops Island Range, which is about 150 miles southeast of DC on the Atlantic coast. I will arrange for the young man to be put on that flight and send instructions to keep the Rocket Range open. He will be shown around the site and the launch equipment, rockets and whatever else needed for the experimentation. The young man can then return tomorrow morning, catch the plane which leaves Wallops Island at 8 AM and he should be back in Washington around this time tomorrow when we can resume our discussions in light of the report which we expect the young man to write overnight and bring along.

This episode exemplifies the hectic speed which NASA's dynamic young Director had set for this program. It was in keeping with NASA's style of the day and was needed to fulfill the target laid for his people by President Kennedy. It is a source of great satisfaction, nay pride, that Pakistan not only kept this momentum, but in fact managed to pleasantly surprise the US by completing the project in 9 months by launching the rocket-borne Sodium Trail experiments in June' 62 from Sonmiani.

Next morning I was back in Washington. I met Prof Salam and together we went over to NASA to meet Mr Frutkin with a positive report from our side. He clearly had received favorable signals from NASA at Wallops Island. Based on that he seemed convinced that Pakistan would be able to cope with such a demanding task.

Later Prof Salam told me that the three-section report covering the design and construction of the range, procurement and installation of equipment and the training of personnel was presented to President Ayub, who seemed quite pleased with what he saw. He was happy that such a report could be produced by Pakistan in such a hurry and he directed that work on the project should be started immediately.

How could Prof Salam trust a young man of 27 years with such a demanding task? I had first met Prof Salam in UK in 1957 after graduating in Mechanical Engineering with first class honors from London University. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) had been formed around 1956. Abdus Salam, then a professor at Cambridge and an honorary Member of the PAEC, was in London to hire competent Pakistani scientists and engineers for the PAEC. The interview board consisted of Pakistan's High Commissioner, Prof Salam, and a British professor who had just been given charge of the newly formed Nuclear Engineering Department at the Imperial College, London. Out of the 17 shortlisted candidates I was the only one selected. Thus started my long and fond association over decades with Prof Salam and we became good friends. His family visited us in Paris in 1966 when I was working there on our next project. 

Dr Ishrat Hussain Usmani, an ICS officer first appointed member and later the Chairman of PAEC, and Prof Salam developed a very good working relationship, so much so that many started calling them the Usmani-Salam brethren. They decided to develop group leaders by sending PAEC staff on long courses; I was one of the lucky ones sent on a 2 years hands-on training to the USAEC Laboratories at Oakridge, Tennessee. It was during these few years from 1957-60 that I often had occasion to meet Prof Salam and my respect for him kept on increasing and we developed a very good relationship which I believe led Prof Abdus Salam to have the confidence that I could handle this exacting project.

The next challenge was to hurriedly form the team, and we put together a small but versatile one which included Salim Mehmud, a specialist in electronics and instrumentation who also happened to be in Oakridge. We were later joined by the other two members, Sikandar Zaman and A.Z. Farooqi from Pakistan, along with Mr Rehmatullah, a deputy Director at the Meteorological department. Our team was assembled at Wallops within weeks and started their work in earnest, which was no mean achievement. It was duly noted by the Americans that the Pakistanis meant business.

The six months between September 1961 and March 1962 were spent with feverish work at both ends, at Wallops Island in Virginia, where our team was undergoing intensive training; and in Karachi, where plans were developed for the design and layout of the Rocket Range and its infrastructure and buildings.

Interestingly the selection of Sonmiani as the location was made by President Ayub himself. That range was close to Karachi, about 40-50 miles, but otherwise it met all the other requirements for that kind of rocket range. The Military Engineering Service (MES) was assigned to urgently start construction work on the rocket range. I moved a number of times between Washington and Karachi to dovetail the work at both ends. The NASA people told us that the launcher and the rockets were based on the Nike Ajax anti aircraft weapons system, which had been declared surplus and its components were lying in some US depots in storage all over the US and that we were allowed to take the Nike Booster Rocket from that system along with some of the control instrumentation. Concerning the scientific experiment to be carried by the rocket as its payload, it was mutually decided that the first experiment would be the Sodium Vapour Trail experiment, which was to be procured from Pakistan's own funds.

The Project proposal was taken by Dr Usmani personally to President Ayub; and this was approved without going through the normal channels of examinations by the Ministries and their Financial Advisors. That was called for because of the urgency involved: the whole idea was that the rocket range should be ready and the experiments conducted before the onset of the next monsoon season, expected to begin around early June 1962, according to the best estimates of the Meteorological Department.

It hardly gave us 9 months to establish the rocket range, train the people, purchase the equipment, ship it across to Karachi, install the equipment, commission and try it out. But I am happy to state that it was done well within the assigned time period and we could meet the tight schedule.

India started their project for the Thumba Range a few months after us but they could not launch the rocket before 1963. That was a year after Pakistan because they followed normal bureaucratic procedures.

By March of 1962, our work in the US had finished. The team members moved to Sonmiani, the equipment had been shipped, the delicate and sensitive equipment interestingly had been packed in the boot of my Rambler car which was again shipped by sea and work started in real earnest at Sonmiani Army ranges.

The notable thing about this effort was that we did not follow the usual office timings. The team worked day and night as required. It was a highly motivated team, time was very short, the job had to be done, the target being early June, and such things were being done in Pakistan for the first time.

On that fateful evening of June 7 1962, when Rehbar-I majestically rose into the night sky of Karachi, both Prof Salam and Dr Usmani were besides themselves with joy and hugged the team members. The next day I received a handwritten note from Prof Salam in which he reiterated his pride in our achievement and stated: ""You have brought back memories of the glories of our early Islamic ancestors and their notable scientific achievements."" That day sticks out vividly for all the team members.

The US of the early sixties was still reeling from the unbelievable shock received from the ""Beep Beep"" of the Soviet Sputnik followed closely by the fantastic feat of Yuri Gagarin's launch into Earth's orbit. America however was quick to recover. President Kennedy marshaled his forces and challenged the Soviets to a ""Race to the Moon"".

Personally speaking I found the Americans of 60-62 very open, welcoming and generous. It was a forward-looking society, confident of its capabilities to lead the world, despite the Soviet challenge in space and the later economic one from Germany and Japan. There were no gun-toting guards in NASA headquarters in the sixties. 

In the years that followed, Pakistan continued to carry out rocket borne Upper Atmospheric studies with the help of NASA, adding other types of experiments based on exploding grenades and tracking of radar reflective aluminum chaff through the Judidart experiment in support of the Indian Ocean Programme, in which Salim Mehmud played the leading role. Tracking radar technology again was a first for Pakistan.

This led to a decision to acquire the technology of indigenous manufacture of such rockets and their propellants. The Americans declined to help Pakistan in this area, questioning the need for local production of rockets, when NASA was willing to supply them free of cost. We explored the possibilities of procuring technology from Japan or France, both of whom turned out to be quite willing, in fact eager, to do so. A contract was finally placed with Sud-Aviation (it subsequently became Aerospatiale) of France for their Centaure/Dragon rockets and with the French ""Service des Poudres"" for their PVC type of rocket propellants. The French space research agency CNES was also very supportive. The team was augmented with Nasim Bhatti to oversee the plant and Hafiz Bhandari for the propellants. French language knowledge had to be acquired and personnel trained in prestigious French specialized institutions.

A rocket manufacturing plant was established near Mauripur, Karachi, using the services of Societe ENSA as consultants. This project was duly completed in 1967 within 3 years and within the projected cost of $3 million. (A Turkish group that visited the plant felt that they would estimate its cost at US$10 million.) This culminated in the first Pakistani-built rocket named the REHNUMA, with the subsequent addition of the much larger SHAHPAR series, launched from Sonmiani from 1967 onwards on a regular basis.",Photos from Pakistan Affairs's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/pakistanPKaffairs/photos/a.292029334242591.63714.276691342443057/1095806853864831/?type=3,2017-01-14 21:38:15,786,16,126,749,31,5,1,0,0

276691342443057_1093318480780335,"A factual Comparison between India's Brahmos Missile and Pakistan's Babur and Raad Cruise Missiles.

(A Re-post)

You may have seen #Indian netizens bragging endlessly about their private corporate co-production missile Brahmos. 
The missile is a Russian company NPO and Indian private venture joint production. It is a rearranged P-800 from Russia. The P-800 in use with Russia has a range of 600 Km, but due to international regulations a country cannot export missiles of over 300 km range and cannot export nuclear missile of any range. Russians had to limit the Brahmos range to 295 Kilometers. All versions of Brahmos in use with India won't go beyond 295 kilometers. But there is a problem with this stated range. 
The missile can only travel the full 295 kilometer if flying at 14 Kilometer altitude. Lower the flight altitude, lower the range. At low altitude the missile has lowest range of only 120 kilometers. That's because the missile is a supersonic missile and on paper being supersonic looks good but high speed has it's demerits. Once anything crosses the speed of sound it creates a shock wave or wall of compressed air in front of it which it has to keep pushing to move forward. That's because air simply can't get out of the way fast enough to make way for the missile , and accumulates. Higher the speed above sound and denser the wall of compressed air and more energy needed to push it. At higher altitudes air is thin and this effect is less pronounced. At lower altitude air is dense and the problem is magnified. That's why reduction in Brahmos range with reduced altitude .
For a missile flying that high to increase range, the stealth is compromised and enemy sees it from far away. 
So in Brahmos case two main requirements for a cruise missile, range and stealth are compromised because it's supersonic. Other problem is invulnerability. Brahmos cannot make tight turns and cannot go round the mountains and buildings same as subsonic cruise missiles do to avoid detection and increase accuracy. It's just too fast to do that and can only make gentle adjustments to it's flight path. 
No wonder most advanced armies prefer using a subsonic cruise missile, such as European Storm shadow, American Tomahawk and Pakistani Babur and Raad.
The other problem is cost and weight to range ratio. Brahmos being supersonic has to endure high levels of stress and heat due to air friction .Also the engine used to obtain supersonic speeds is called Ramjet engine, and it is, not fuel efficient. So the missile also carries far more fuel than a Subsonic missile.
For that reason it needs to be made of better and expensive alloys ,increasing cost and weight. 
At 3 million a piece and weighing 3 tons for ground and naval version, the missile goes only 295 km, or less than half as far as Pakistan's babur. 
Babur cruise missile only costs a few hundred thousand a piece and goes more than twice the range of Brahmos, while weighing less than half at 1.4 tons. 
The bulky missile also cannot carry much explosives and only has a warhead of 250 Kg compared to Babur's 350 Kg. 
It is argued that the missile compensates for carrying less explosives by kinetic energy of impact which is very high and can cause substantial damage. 
But we did calculate kinetic energy of impact for Pakistan airforce's anti ship missile CM-400AKG and it was 200Kg equivalent of explosives when the CM-400AKG impacts target at Mach 5.
Brahmos impact speed is about half that. 
Stipulating by theses known parameters Brahmos will have total destructive power of 250kg warhead and another 100 kg equivalent of warhead power, making its impact and warhead explosion equivalent of 350 kg of chemical explosives. That's same as Babur albeit at much lower costs. 
Every missile needs a launcher and so does Brahmos. It wasn't difficult or expensive to fit a few trucks with Brahmos land version tubular launchers, the problem arises when India wanted to introduce sea and air versions of Brahmos. The missile was just too big in length and breadth to be able to be fitted on any Indian naval platform without major modifications to the ship or submarine. A total of 13 Indian Navy ships have been fitted with Brahmos Ship to Ship and Ship to shore missiles. But the problem of range remains as it is. To fire the missile in sea skimming mode or a Combination of High altitude and low altitude flight the Indian Navy ships will have to come within less than 200 Kilometers of enemy Ships or coast. That will be well within range of Pakistan Navy's C-802 Missiles. The Brahmos will also lose stealth as mentioned earlier and very much likely to become a target of Pakistan Navy's 5000 Rounds per minute CIWS automated guns.
However it can be argued that anti ship capability is the only viable characteristic of Brahmos. Pakistan is using much cheaper options such as C-802 and now home made Zarb Missile.
About Submarine Launch of Barhmos. A submerged pontoon test fire of the missile was conducted in 2013 and hailed successful. But the missile needs special Launch tubes or Vertical Launch system VLS, as the missile is too wide for Submarine Torpedo tubes.These special wide vertical tubes will have to be retro fitted on existing Indian submarines. that is an extremely expensive undertaking and the time frame needed to do the job is many months taking the submarine out of service. No such attempts have been made and no Indian submarine is even undergoing any conversion for Brahmos launch.
On the other hand Pakistan built Babur Cruise missiles keeping in view Submarine design and dimensions. A standard Submarine Torpedo tube is 533 Millimeters in diameter. Babur Cruise missile was kept narrow at 520 Millimeter diameter,so that it could be fitted in an existing Pakistani submarine Torpedo tube without any significant and expensive modification to the submarine. The capability was first demonstrated on 09th of January 2017 when an unspecified submarine launched a Babur cruise missile from Torpedo tube. The only modification required to the submarine was to the software of fire control system.
About Air launch Brahmos. The Private firm Brahmos corporation did modify the missile for air launch. Reducing the weight from 3 Tons to 2.5 Tons and developing a special rail to be fitted to Indian jets.
Trouble was that Indian air force had no jets capable of lifting an 8 meter long 25000 Kilo missile. The largest Indian airforce jet the SU-30MKI simply doesn't have enough structural strength to hang 2.5 tons on a single hard point.
The solution was to modify the jets specially for Carrying Brahmos. Again an expensive undertaking. But Indian Government did agree to pay for the project. A total of 40 IAF SU-30 had to be structurally strengthened for carrying a single the missile under the belly . Additional metal frames had to be welded to the jet to increase strength,making it heavy and effecting overall performance,reducing range. So far only one such jet has been handed over to IAF and completing modification on 39 more will take many more years.
So in effect so far only one IAF jet can carry and fire a Brahmos. It's another thing that even that hasn't been done yet and the project is still experimental .But IAF jets are not ready as explained above,and no deliveries have been made by Brahmos manufacturer.

On the other hand the whole fleet of Pakistan's Mirage jets can carry and fire one Raad cruise missile from under the belly hard point. Thus making #Pakistan air force Nuclear capable,while no such capability exists among Indian air force.No According to reports India has made arrangements with Russia to increase the range of Brahmos.. For doing that, all existing Brahmos missiles in the Indian arsenal will have to go back to the factory and refitted and reprogrammed. Whenever that happens, the missile will attain a maximum range of what Russian version of P-800 had, a maximum range of 600 kilometre at altitude, decreasing to less than 200 kilometre if the missile is sent on sea skimming or low flying mode.. However work hasn't started on the project yet. #IAF has put a requisition for 200 Air launched versions of #Brahmos. 
On the other hand, being subsonic, both babur and Raad maintain the range in all flight profiles. 700 + km for Babur and 350+ Km for raad. The Pakistani air launched cruise missile Raad also carries much heavier warhead of 450 kg than Brahmo 250 kg

276691342443057_1092194490892734,"Indians Brahmos bluff. 

You may have seen Indian netizens bragging endlessly about their private corporate co-production missile Brahmos. 
The missile is a Russian company NPO and Indian private venture joint production.  It is a rearranged P-800 from Russia. The P-800 in use with Russia has a range of 600 Km,  but due to international regulations a country cannot export missiles of over 300 km range and cannot export nuclear missile of any range. Russians had to limit the Brahmos range to 295 Kilometers. All versions of Brahmos in use with India won't go beyond 295 kilometers. But there is a problem with this stated range. 
The missile can only travel the full 295 kilometer if flying at 14 Kilometer altitude. Lower the flight altitude, lower the range. At low altitude the missile has lowest range of only 120 kilometers. That's because the missile is a supersonic missile and on paper being supersonic looks good but high speed has it's demerits.  Once anything crosses the speed of sound it creates a shock wave or wall of compressed air in front of it which it has to keep pushing to move forward.  That's because air simply can't get out of the way fast enough to make way for the missile , and accumulates. Higher the speed above sound and denser the wall of compressed air and more energy needed to push it. At higher altitudes air is thin and this effect is less pronounced.  At lower altitude air is dense and the problem is magnified.  That's why reduction in Brahmos range with reduced altitude .
For a missile flying that high to increase range, the stealth is compromised and enemy sees it from far away. 
So in Brahmos case two main requirements for a cruise missile, range and stealth are compromised because it's supersonic. Other problem is invulnerability.  Brahmos cannot make tight turns and cannot go round the mountains and buildings same as subsonic cruise missiles do to avoid detection and increase accuracy. It's just too fast to do that and can only make gentle adjustments to it's flight path. 
No wonder most advanced armies prefer using a subsonic cruise missile, such as European Storm shadow,  American Tomahawk and Pakistani Babur and Raad. 

The other problem is cost and weight to range ratio.  Brahmos being supersonic has to endure high levels of stress and heat due to air friction .Also the engine used to obtain supersonic speeds is called Ramjet engine, and it is, not fuel efficient.  So the missile also carries far more fuel than a Subsonic missile.
For that reason it needs to be made of better and expensive alloys ,increasing cost and weight. 
At 3 million a piece and weighing 3 tons for ground and naval version, the missile goes only 295 km, or less than half as far as Pakistan's babur. 
Babur cruise missile only costs a few hundred thousand a piece and goes more than twice the range of Brahmos,  while weighing less than half at 1.4 tons. 
The bulky missile also cannot carry much explosives and only has a warhead of 250 Kg compared to  Babur's 350 Kg. 
It is argued that the missile compensates for carrying less explosives by kinetic energy of impact which is very high and can cause substantial damage. 
But we did calculate kinetic energy of impact for Pakistan airforce's anti ship missile CM-400AKG and it was 200Kg equivalent of explosives when the CM-400AKG impacts target at Mach 5.
Brahmos impact speed is about half that. 
Stipulating by theses known parameters Brahmos will have total destructive power of 250kg warhead and another 100 kg equivalent of warhead power,  making its impact and warhead explosion equivalent of 350 kg of chemical explosives. That's same as Babur albeit at much lower costs. 
Every missile needs a launcher and so does Brahmos. It wasn't difficult or expensive to fit a few trucks with Brahmos land version tubular launchers,  the problem arises when India wanted to introduce sea and air versions of Brahmos. The missile was just too big in length and breadth to be able to be fitted on any Indian naval platform without major modifications to the ship or submarine. A total of 13 Indian Navy ships have been fitted with Brahmos Ship to Ship and Ship to shore missiles. But the problem of range remains as it is. To fire the missile in sea skimming mode or a Combination of High altitude and low altitude flight the Indian Navy ships will have to come within less than 200 Kilometers of enemy Ships or coast. That will be well within range of Pakistan Navy's C-802 Missiles. The Brahmos will also lose stealth as mentioned earlier and very much likely to become a target of Pakistan Navy's 5000 Rounds per minute CIWS automated guns.
However it can be argued that anti ship capability is the only viable characteristic of Brahmos. Pakistan is using much cheaper options such as C-802 and now home made Zarb Missile.
About Submarine Launch of Barhmos. A submerged pontoon test fire of the missile was conducted in 2013 and hailed successful. But the missile needs special Launch tubes or Vertical Launch system VLS, as the missile is too wide for Submarine Torpedo tubes.These special wide vertical tubes will have to be retro fitted on existing Indian submarines. that is an extremely expensive undertaking and the time frame needed to do the job is many months taking the submarine out of service. No such attempts have been made and no Indian submarine is even undergoing any conversion for Brahmos launch.
On the other hand Pakistan built Babur Cruise missiles keeping in view Submarine design and dimensions. A standard Submarine Torpedo tube is 533 Millimeters in diameter. Babur Cruise missile was kept narrow at 520 Millimeter diameter,so that it could be fitted in an existing Pakistani submarine Torpedo tube without any significant and expensive modification to the submarine. The capability was first demonstrated on 09th of January 2017 when an unspecified submarine launched a Babur cruise missile from Torpedo tube. The only modification required to the submarine was to the software of fire control system.
About Air launch Brahmos. The Private firm Brahmos corporation did modify the missile for air launch. Reducing the weight from 3 Tons to 2.5 Tons and developing a special rail to be fitted to Indian jets.
Trouble was that Indian air force had no jets capable of lifting an 8 meter long 25000 Kilo missile. The largest Indian airforce jet the SU-30MKI simply doesn't have enough structural strength to hang 2.5 tons on a single hard point.
The solution was to modify the jets specially for Carrying Brahmos. Again an expensive undertaking. But Indian Government did agree to pay for the project. A total of 40 IAF SU-30 had to be structurally strengthened for carrying a single the missile under the belly . Additional metal frames had to be welded to the jet to increase strength,making it heavy and effecting overall performance,reducing range. So far only one such jet has been handed over to IAF and completing modification on 39 more will take many more years.
So in effect so far only one IAF jet can carry and fire a Brahmos. It's another thing that even that hasn't been done yet and the project is still experimental .
On the other hand the whole fleet of Pakistan's Mirage jets can carry and fire one Raad cruise missile from under the belly hard point. Thus making Pakistan air force Nuclear capable,while no such capability exists among Indian air force.No According to reports India has made arrangements with Russia to increase the range of Brahmos..

With this latest capability Pakistan completed nuclear triad and can launch a nuclear weapon from land air and sea. The five superpowers can do so and now Pakistan becomes the sixth such country in the world. 

India don't have nuclear triad. 
Brahmos isn't nuclear capable as it's a Russia important and Russia is a signatory of MTCR which bars countries from exporting Nuclear capable missiles. Hint is, in the range of Brahmos which is, limited to 300km to comply with MTCR. 
Also no indian jet can currently fire a Brahmos.  It's too heavy at 3 tons. 
Sukhoi SU-30 of IAF had to be specially modified to carry one Brahmos each and so far only one such jet has completed modification.  Even that jet is just an experimental platform and hasn't yet fired a Brahmos,  just flew with it to check stresses on aircraft. 
There is, no other cruise missile in service with Indian armed forces.  So Indian air launched nuclear triad is non existent. 

About sea launch.  Their only one submarine the INS Arihant will be capable of firing nuclear missiles,  but neither the submarine nor the missile are ready yet and going through trials. 
They have only fired K-15 missiles from a sub sea pontoon, not the actual submarine. And none of their submarine carry a cruise missile. Brahmos can only be fired from their surface ships with conventional warhead. Nurbhay is not ready yet and crashed during multiple test flights.

The 15 Cm diameter glass sphere with surrounding magnets and equipment called #GLAST (  Glass Spherical Tokamak)  got Pakistan's name included in the list of countries performing research in Hydrogen Fusion. The little Pakistani reactor was endorsed by #ITER. 
The atomic energy commission of Pakistan said they have built the facility to learn basic concepts about Fusion reaction technology and to train Pakistani scientific staff in that field. 
7 years on in 2015 some money was allocated for building a larger scale metallic Fusion reactor.

276691342443057_1079400015505515,"A slow motion analysis of India's well trumpeted Agni-V launch from a canister reveals something no other deployed road mobile ICBM anywhere else in the world has. 

Every other canister mounted ICBM such as Russian Topol-M use gas generator at the bottom of the tube to generate enough pressure to push the Missile out of the tube and with enough force to toss it a few feet clear of the tube for the main rocket motor to ignite. 
At the same time inertia metres on missile calculate which way the missile is tilting and turn the gimbal mounted rocket nozzle for up righting the missile. All this happens in less than second or two. 
The rocket motor of the missile must be powerful and quick enough to start generating enough thrust to launch the missile straight away soon after clearing the tube, as the momentum provided by the gas generator at the bottom of the tube doesn't catapult the missile, but is barely enough to toss it a few feet clear of the tube. 
If the missile electronics aren't quick enough, or the rocket motor isn't powerful enough, or the gimbal mounted thrust vectoring nozzle isn't mobile enough to correct large tilts which may happen due to gust of winds soon after being tossed out of the tube,  then the missile isn't fit for such launch arrangements. 
India's Agni-V seems to have all the above problems as clearly seen in the video.  The Agni-V is the only Tube/canister launched ICBM which needs a booster. The big chunk that is seen falling off the missile soon after launch. 
The use of this extra appendage increases the overall weight and length of the missile. India's Agni-V is already the heaviest in it's class at 50 tons and then the inclusion of a booster adds a ton or two to the weight. 
With the need of booster,  India's Agni-V shows it's weaknesses.  The missile is just too heavy for the main rocket motor to bear it's weight immediately after being tossed out of canister / tube.  So booster provides additional thrust to create enough upward momentum so that relatively less powerful Agni-V main rocket motor can keep the upward momentum without the missile dropping back on the launcher. 
Also the missile thrust diverting nozzle doesn't seem to be quick enough to be trusted with uprighting the missile in case it's tilted and the missile has to continue upwards before slowly turning towards it's main path.  All other tube launched ICBM can turn immediately after launch. 
The act of mounting Agni-V in a tube/canisters seems beyond missiles capabilities,  but the missile is botched up to somehow work under those conditions. 
India has a history of performing needless and expensive theatrics for the sake of publicity.

پچھلے ہفتے بھارت کے نربھے کروز,میزائیل کی شرمناک ناکامی کے بعد اپنا نام بچانے کی خاطر بھارت نے آج گودام سے نکال کر ایک اگنی پنجم میزائل داغ دیا اور اسے بھارت کی شاندار کامیابی قرار دیا. بھارت یہ بھی دعوا کرتا ہے کہ ان کا اگنی پنجم اپنی طرز کا دنیا کا جدید ترین میزائل ہے جو ایک سے زیادہ ایٹم بم لے جا سکتا ہے. 
لیکن بھارت کا اگنی پنجم پچاس ہزار کلو وزنی ہے اور پانچ ہزار پانچ سو کلومیٹر تک مار کر سکتا ہے,  لیکن اس سے ملتے جلتے وزن کا روسی ٹوپول ایم میزائل سینتالیس ہزار کلو ورن کے ساتھ,  گیارہ ہزار کلومیٹر مار کر سکتا ہے.  چنانچہ بھارتی دعوا غلط ثابت ہوا کہ ان کا اگنی پنجم اپنی طرز کا دنیا کا جدید ترین میزائل ہے .
دراصل اگنی پنجم بھارت کے ایک پرانے میزائل اگنی سوئم میں ایندھن زیادہ ڈال کر بنایا گیا. 
زیادہ ایندھن سے میزائل کی پہنچ زیادہ ہو گئی مگر ایندھن نے میزائل کے اوپر تکونی جگہ میں کافی جگہ گھیر لی. میزائل کے اوپر یہ تکون تمام کا تمام ایٹم بم رکھنے کے لیئے مختص ہوتا ہے. لیکن تصویر میں دیکھا جا سکتا ہے کہ بھارت کے اگنی پنجم پہ کالی تکون کی چھوٹی سی جگہ میں ہی ایٹم بم آ سکتا ہے.  نیچے کی تمام جکہ ایندھن نے گھیر رکھی ہے.

Although Indians make tall claims about Agni-5 being the best in it's category.The 50 Ton missile  is the heaviest in the world for the range it can go. A Russian Missile of similar weight the Topol-M can reach 11000 Kilometers while weighing 47 Tons which is  3 tons less than India's Agni . It's another thing that Agni-5 has half the range at 5500 Km. 
Agni-5 is actually an Agni-3 on which an extra stage has been mounted to increase range. Squeezing in a third stage in the triangular area on top of the missile which was meant for a warhead meant the warhead size  had to be significantly reduced , effecting the blast yield which is now very less for an Agni-5 Warhead. May be in the range of 100-200 Kilotons.
The Black triangle on top of Agni-5 is the little space left for mounting the nuclear weapon and that much space is not enough for MIRV or multiple warheads as claimed by many Indian sources that Agni-5 is MIRV capable while it's clearly not.
Pakistan has also reduced Warhead size on their missiles but maintained the blast yield. In fact Pakistan has demonstrated miniaturizing skills of nuclear weapons in the form of Nasr which carries a nuclear weapon half the size of a football.
India hasn't demonstrated any such skills on any of their missiles. Their shortest range nuclear missile Prithvi still has to carry large one ton nuclear warhead.

Other objectives included increase of GNP by 37%, provide 5.5 million new job opportunities, strengthen balance of payment, develop basic industries, arrest population growth and to provide better health and education facilities. He boosted industrial sector of EP. A newsprint factory at Khulna was opened in 1959. Fertilizer factory was constructed in Fenchuganj in 1960.
By 1970, the Karnaphuli paper mill and Khulna newsprint factory produced paper and newsprint to the tune of 82000 tons. Chittagong Port that had been totally neglected by the British prior to partition was developed into one of the most modern ports of South Asia. Khulna shipyard in 1957 and Chittagong dockyard in 1960 were also developed. Chalna anchorage was developed to handle 23 lakh ton of goods. The budget of EP that stood at Rs. 17 crore in 1948-49 rose to Rs. 40 crore in 1959-60. In 1969-70 it was 169 crore. The 1962 Constitution laid down the share of central revenue for EP as 56% and 46% for West Pakistan.
His third five-year plan (1965-70) aimed at achieving parity in the per capita income of the two wings of Pakistan in the long-term perspective.  His ambitious plan to reduce parity dampened due to the 1965 War when the US stopped economic and military aid to Pakistan. Still, lot of ground was covered and many development works were commissioned. During that period, 27 factories at the cost of Rs. 89 crores were constructed. These included an iron and steel mill at Chittagong in 1967, technical institute at Kaptia and industrial research laboratories at Dacca and Rajshahi. All told EP had one large and seven small steel mills, petroleum refinery, small arms factory, 53 jute mills, 30 tanneries and six oil & gas refineries. As a result, the industrial goods produced in EP increased from 300 to 2000%. Art and silk cloth production shot up from 1.50 lakh sq. yd. in 1965-66 to 68 lakh in 1969-70. Road mileage increased to 1,083 while a vast network of unmetalled roads was developed to connect villages with the main roads. Besides, 11000 bridges and culverts were made.

Rs. 40.02 crore were spent to lay new railway line Narsingdi-Mandiganj sector and to upgrade some narrow gauge railway lines to broad gauge lines. River ports of Dacca, Narayanganj, Chandpur, Barisal and Khulna were made fully functional for river traffic. Rs. 11.5 crores was spent on procurement of inland river transport. Consequent to development of Teista Barrage, Tipper-Chittagong and Dacca-Narayanganj irrigation projects, the irrigation water supply increased by 400%. Energy plants were established at Dacca and Mymensingh. The electric energy increased from 17000 mw to 30,000 mw in 1964-65 and to 83000 in 1969-70. A modern airport at Tejgaon was built. A television station was opened at Dacca and Dacca converted from a district town to a cosmopolitan city throbbing with life.
The exports from EP to West Pakistan worth 4879 crores in 1964-65 were further enhanced by Rs. 76 crores in 1968-70. In terms of unfavorable balance of trade between the two wings in primary commodities, the ratio was narrowed down from 13:1 in 1948-49 to 1.5:1 in 1969-70. In the education sector, one Cadet College, number of schools, colleges and universities were established. Between 1947 and 1971, 67000 schools, 225 colleges and five universities were built. 40% seats were reserved for the Bengalis in the civil service to rectify the disparity. This hpw was over and above the 20% on merit. Subramanian also admits that Bengali representation in all the government posts ascended from 1 in 1947 to 36% in 1968. Their number rose from one in 1947 to 40.9% in 1969. About the disparity in armed forces representation, apart from historical reasons, the Bengalis disinterest and reluctance to serve away from their home province was the major factor in bridging the gap. Opening of Cadet College, lowering of recruitment standards and raising of EBR units were all aimed at reducing the gap.

The developmental expenditure shot up from Rs. 336 crore in the first five-year plan to Rs. 1707 crore in the third five-year plan. Of this, 70% was consumed by public sector.  In the field of foreign exchange loans and grants, Rs. 21.23 crore in the first five-year plan, Rs. 61.05 crore in the second and Rs. 182.49 crore in the third plan was allocated to EP. In the last plan, the share of EP exceeded that of West Pakistan by 11%. The Rupee loans and grants jumped from Rs. 148.70 crore in the first plan to 663.79 crore in the third plan. In case of the western wing, the increase was from Rs. 187.16 crore to Rs. 433.87 crore. 
The investment in private sector in West Pakistan in the third five-year plan was Rs. 1590 crore while in EP it had been increased from Rs. 73 crore to Rs. 544 crore. In order to boost private investment in that wing, far too many concessions were given by the central government in fiscal, monetary and import policies. Differential in rate of import duty on machinery was raised from 28.6% to 40% in favor of EP. To encourage rubber plantation, a concessional tax treatment to profits of rubber estates was accorded. In case of jute industry, duty on home clearance of jute manufacturers was radically reduced. Excise duty on mineral oil for bathing of jute was reduced from 20% to 6.25%. Rate of import duty on aluminum tubing and millboard needed for manufacture of bobbins for jute industry was brought down from 50% to 36%.
Likewise, rate of import duty on nylon yarn required for fishing nets mostly used in EP was reduced from 260% to 50%. Import of phosphate and sulphur used in manufacture of super phosphate fertilizer mostly produced in EP was made free of custom duty and sales tax. Sales taxes on tarpaulins and imported coal extensively used in EP were reduced to 10% and 5% respectively. Rate of import duty on sago seeds, mostly consumed in EP was reduced from 40% to 15%. Steel ingots were exempted from excise duty of Rs. 50 per ton. In order to bring down the cost of production of cement in EP, import duty on clinkers was slashed from 75% to 20%. Duty on dyed umbrella was cut down from 125% to 35% and duty on iron steel castings and forging as well as on electroplated anodes was reduced.",,video,https://www.facebook.com/pakistanPKaffairs/videos/1054534481325402/,2016-12-01 20:46:23,191,15,61,180,8,2,1,0,0

On 11th of November 1970 Bangladesh (Then east Pakistan) was hit by one the deadliest cyclones in recorded human history which had the highest death toll caused by any Cyclone to this date.
The Bhola cyclone made landfall at the exact time of high tides and caused a combined storm surge of up to 6 meter high wall of water.
Most of the infrastructure was obliterated , making rescue efforts very difficult. At the time Pakistan's annual budget was 850 Million Dollars and the financial loss caused by the Bhola Cyclone within 48 hours was estimated to be 86 Million Dollars in 1970s money. That was 10% of the country's budget vanished in just two days of devastation.
Ayub khan had resigned in March 1969 due to pressure from Zulfiqar Bhutto and Sheikh Mujeeb who were both jostling for power. Yehya Khan was the Martial law administrator who was spending most of his time trying to avoid a civil war and rescue missions to Bangladesh were neglected. Situation was also compounded by the fact that the area of devastation was too large an not many roads , Bridges or even boats survived to reach those effected.
India and Sheikh Mujeeb pounced on the opportunity and started their venomous propaganda of neglect by West Pakistan.All India radio would transmit daily propaganda asking Bengali public to look around and just see the conditions they are living in , while portraying West Pakistan as Paris and New York. It was another thing that at the time East Pakistan was hit by the cyclone not the west, so infrastructure was still intact in West Pakistan not East.
 Sheikh Mujeeb ignored the fact that the cyclone was an act of God and not caused by West Pakistan. He ignored the fact that more than 10% of the combined East and West Pakistan's budget has been obliterated in damages caused by the Storm and finding alternate money for rebuilding will take time. He ignored the fact that most of the roads bridges and boats required for rescue missions were lost and Pakistan army was doing what they could with limited resources and zero political backing.
Bengali people bought into his propaganda and within an year , after great violence Bangladesh was a separate country. They were desperate and hungry and would hold on to any hope of salvation. Sheikh Mujeeb posed as their saviour and so did India.
After independence of Bangladesh in which damage caused by Bhola Cyclone was used to win over the people, Sheikh Mujeeb still couldn't fix it and the country faced famine. In 1974 food scarcity in Bangladesh was so bad that from March 1974 to December 1975 about 1.5 Million Bengali died of starvation.  A death toll similar or higher than the Bhola Cyclone which triggered the violent Bangladeshi freedom movement. India did not help the starving Bengalis.
Sheikh Mujeeb was strangely assassinated on Indian Indepence day the 15th of August in 1975,just a few months after the famine.",Why Bengalis hated Pakistan ?

پچھلے دنوں اقوام متحدہ کے خصوصی ماحولیاتی ادارے GCF گرین کلائیمیٹ فنڈ نے جب پاکستان کو سیلاب کی روک تھام کے لیئے 3.5 کروڑ  ڈالر دینے چاہے تو بھارت مخالفت میں کود پڑا. 

پاکستان نے سائنسی اور تکنیکی بنیادوں پہ ایک تفصیلی دستاویز اقوام متحدہ کو پیش کی تھی جس میں یہ کہا گیا تھا کہ پاکستان کے علاقے گلگت بلتستان میں موجود گلیشیئر وں پہ جدید آلات لگا کر ان کے پگھلنے کی رفتار ناپنے سے سیلابی ریلوں کی آمد کی پیشگی اطلاع دی جا سکتی ہے. پاکستان کی جمع شدہ تحقیقاتی رپورٹ میں یہ کہا گیا تھا کہ منصوبہ سے سات لاکھ افراد کو سیلاب سے تحفظ ملے گا.

اس معاملہ پہ رقم کی فراہمی کے لیئے اقوام متحدہ کا اجلاس ہوا تو پاکستان کی تفصیلی اور سائنسی طور پہ صحیح رپورٹ کی تمام ممبر ممالک نے تائید کی اور منصوبہ کے لیئے 3.5 کروڑ ڈالر کی فراہمی حمایت کی.  حسب عادت بھارت میدان میں کود پڑا اور پاکستان کے منصوبے کے خلاف اوٹ پٹانگ بحث شروع کر دی. 
اجلاس میں موجود بھارتی نمائندہ نے کہا کہ پاکستان میں کوئ گلیشیئر نھیں پگھل رہے اور آبادی کو سیلاب سے بھی کوئ خطرہ نھیں. اور اگر پاکستان نے سیلاب سے انتباہ کا نظام نصب کیا تو اس سے بھارت کو خطرہ ہوگا. ایسے جاہلانا اور بیہنگم دلائل سن کر اجلاس میں موجود دوسرے ممالک کے مندوبین سمجھ گئے کہ بھارت کو مسئلہ سیاسی ہے تکنیکی نھیں.  بھارت پاکستان کی ہر سطح پہ مخالفت اپنا فرض سمجھتا ہے اور اجلاس میں بھارت کی عجیب و غریب اور بے تکے اعتراضات کا سیاسی پہلو کے علاوہ نہ سر ہے نہ پاؤں. 
اجلاس سائنسی بنیادوں پہ ماحول کے تحفظ کے لیئے تھا سیاست کے لیئے نھیں. بھارتی نمائندہ جتنا بولتا گیا اتنا ہی باقی ممالک کے نمائندے پاکستان کے ساتھ ہوتے گئے. 
جب بھارتی نے اپنی لمبی چوڑی تقریر ختم کی تو پاکستانی نمائندے کو اس کی خرافات کا جواب دینے کی بھی ضرورت نہ پڑی اور باقی ممالک نے یکزبان ہو کہ پاکستان کی حمایت کر ڈالی.  نہ صرف یہ بلکہ اجلاس کے سربراہ ممالک  نے بھارتی بکواس کو رد کرتے ہوئے اس کے نمائندے پہ بھی دباؤ ڈالا کہ وہ بھی پاکستان کے منصوبہ کے لیئے اقوام متحدہ کی رقم کے اجرا کے لیئے اقوام متحدہ کے ماحویاتی ادارے کے فیصلے کی حمایت کرے.  بھارتی نمائندے کو یہ باور کرا دیا گیا کہ پاکستان نے انتہائ تفصیلی اور پر تحقیق رپورٹ جمع کرائ ہے اور بھارت کی کوئ بھی دلیل اس رپورٹ کے کسی نکتے کو تکنیکی بنیاد پہ در نھیں کر پا رہی.  
مجبوراً بھاتی نے بھی پاکستان کو رقم کی فراہمی کی حمایت کر ڈالی .
اس کے بر عکس اگر پاکستان نے مکمل تحقیق کے ساتھ تفصیلی رپورٹ اقوام متحدہ میں دائر نہ کی ہوتی تو آج پاکستان کو ایک اور سفارتی ہار کا سامنہ کرنا پڑتا.

To compensate for that loss India was asked to make some sort of deal with Lockheed which India had to oblige.

The weapon system carries neutron flux warheads. Instead of blast wave or heat as destructive force, the detonation produces an intense pulse of high energy neutrons. 
The warhead is very small, weighing less than 30 Kg. At the core sits a very small sphere of plutonium surrounded by special isotopes of Hydrogen or Lithium. A ceramic capacitor discharges a very high voltage electric current in a very small area . The sudden electric discharge is well above  thousands of volts and produces an extremely hot electric arc  causing a few hydrogen atoms to collide forcefully enough  to merge and produce limited numbers of high energy neutron. The warhead is designed in a way that this initial small burst of neutrons hits the Plutonium sphere. The plutonium undergoes Fission reaction or breaking of plutonium nuclei,  releasing vast amounts of heat in the form of X-rays. 
This intense burst of X-ray heats up the Hydrogen surrounding the plutonium Core to temperatures or many millions of Centigrades.
The warhead design uses an outer layer made of material which melts under influence of heat and collapses inwards creating a large vapour pressure . The heat and pressure causes Hydrogen nuclei to go through fusion reaction,  creating helium and intense burst of neutrons. 
Those neutrons either kill or disable any living thing in a radius of about 2 kilometre.
Since Plutonium is the only radioactive material in the design and is in small quantity,  there is very little residual radiation after the blast and soon after the blast the area is safe to be used by soldiers.

The plan was to have thousands of Tanks,armored vehicles and artillery cannons lined up along Pakistani border and advance deep inside Pakistani territory behind a concentrated column of Tanks ,cannons and armored vehicles while getting air cover by IAF.
This doctrine would have been very problematic for Pakistan as such an advance by India could effectively cut Pakistan in two or more halves,disrupting or disabling any retaliation by Pakistani armed forces as supply lines would have been scuttled.
Hitting and destroying any armored vehicle is difficult as they are protected by thick platings and other means.
In cold start attack by India , the PAF would have been engaged by IAF preventing them from launching decisive attacks on advancing Indian Armored  columns. The limited strikes by Pakistani ground forces would have been very costly in lives and material as Indian army would have been advancing under cover of heavy shelling by their Cannons.
The situation called for out of he box thinking and Nasr Missile was the result.
The missile s a high energy Neutron  weapon and not a WMD just a ""Disablement weapon"". The blast created by detonation of Nasr's warhead is insignificant as more than 70% of the Missile's nuclear energy is used up in creating a large pulse of fast moving High energy Nuterons. The particle can penetrate through Armored platings and effect the Electronics and Soldier operating the Indian armored vehicles, Disabling the machine and sickening the soldiers due to a sudden high radiation dose.
The weapon used a very small Fission trigger of Plutonium and large part of the neutron pulse comes from a shell of Deuterium / Tritium / Lithium during fusion. This Fission - Fusion design is complicated but leaves very little Nuclear fallout or residual radiation as Plutonium core is too small and disperses over large enough area to make the residual radiation withing bearable limits.

276691342443057_942558035856381,"۔ پاکستان لیزر کے شعبہ میں خاص مہارت رکھتا ہے, 
لیزر کی کئی خاصیتیں عام روشنی میں نہیں ہوتیں.  مثلاً انتہائ باریک شعاع جو لمبے فاصلے طے کرنے کے بعد بھی نہیں بکھرتی. 

اس خاص قسم کی روشنی کے کئ استعمال ہیں.  گرم لیزر سے دھات کاٹنا.  فاصلے ناپنا.  چیزوں کو ٹھنڈا کرنا. طب اور جراحی اس شعاع کے کئی استعمال میں سے چند ہیں, 
لیزر 1960 میں ایجا ہوئ اور صرف نو سال بعد 
پاکستان نے لیزر سے متعلق تحقیق کے میدان  میں 1969 میں قدم  رکھا. 
لاہور کے قریب ایک چھوٹی سی عمارت میں چند پاکستانی سائنسدانوں نے ملک کی پہلی لیزر شعاع پیدا کی. 
اسی زمانے میں اسلام آباد کے قریب ""نیلور"" کے نام سے ایک ایٹمی لیبارٹری بنائ گئ اور ادھر پاکستان کا پہلا ایٹمی ریاکٹر لگایا گیا. اسوقت کی حکومت کی پالیسی تھی کہ پاکستان میں سائنسی تحقیق کی بنیادیں مستحکم کیں جائیں. نیلور میں ایٹمی لیبارٹری کے ساتھ کئ اور لیبارٹریاں لگائ گئیں. انہی لیبارٹریوں میں سے ایک NILOP  کے نام سے قائم کی گئ جس کو لیزر اور روشنی کی سائنس کے تحقیقی آلات سے لیس کیا گیا. لاھور میں جو تحقیق شروع ہوئ تھی وہ یہاں منتقل ہو گئ. 
اسی سال مشرقی پاکستان یا موجودہ بنگلادیش میں بھی ایٹمی لیبارٹری قائم کی گئ تاکہ پاکستان کا وہ حصہ بھی سائنس کے میدان میں فاعل کردار ادا کرے. 
1971 میں بنگلادیش کے قیام کے بعد اُن کی ایٹمی تحقیق بند ہوئ مگر پاکستان نے ایٹم اور لیزر سمیت کئی شعبوں میں کام جاری رکھا. NILOP یا نیشنل انسٹی ٹیوٹ آف لیزر میں خوب تحقیق ہوئ. نئی دریافت شدہ لیزر کی سائنس پہ پاکستانی محققین کے مقالعے دنیا بھر کے سائنسی جرائد میں چھپے. یاد رہے کہ وہ آج کل کا زمانہ نہیں تھا جب ہر کسی کے چابی کے گچھے میں لیزر لٹکی ہوتی ہے- یہ ایک نئ اور نایاب طیز تھی جس پہ بہت کم ممالک تحقیق کر رہے تھے 
پاکستانیوں کی تحقیق کے چرچے ان سائنسدانوں تک گئے جنھوں نے لیزر ایجاد کی تھی اور 1976 میں نوبل انعام یافتہ ڈاکٹر الفریڈ کاسٹلر جو لیزر کے دنیا کے اولین محققین میں سے ایک تھے,وہ بھی پاکستانیوں کے اس شعبہ میں کام سے متاثر ہو کہ پاکستان آئے اور پاکستانی سائنسدانوں اور طلبا کو لیزر کے موجد سے سیکھنے کا موقع ملا . اسوقت لیزر کی تحقیق تھیوریٹیکل یا نظریاتی درجہ کا تھا. اس سارے کام سے پاکستانی سائنسدانوں کو ہر طرح کی لیزر کی خوب سمجھ بوجھ حاصل ہوئ.
دوسری طرف پاکستان کو مسلسل بھارت سے خطرہ رہا اور اپنے بچاؤ کی خاطر پاکستان کو فوجی ایٹمی پروگرام چلانا پڑا. 1976 میں ڈاکٹر عبدالقدیر خان کے زیر سرپرستی کہوٹہ ریسرچ لیبارٹری کا قیام عمل میں آیا. ادھر ڈاکٹر قدیر کی ڈیزائن کردہ centrifuge مشینیں لگائ گئیں جو خام یورانیم میں سے کارآمد یورانیم نکالتی ہیں. یہ مشینیں مختلف اقسام کے یورانیم کو الگ الگ کر کہ ایک قسم کا یورانیم ایٹمی بجلی گھروں کو اور دوسرے قسم کا ایٹم بم کے لیئے فراہم کرتی ہیں.
مگر چونکہ یہ مشینیں فی مشین  انتہائ کم مقدار میں یورانیم نکالتی ہیں اسلیئے کارآمد مقدار میں یورانیم حاصل کرنے کے لیئے ایسی کئ ھزار مشینیں ایک ہی جگہ پہ لگانی پڑتی ہیں. کہوٹہ کی تنصیب کئ ایکڑ رقبہ پہ محیط تھی اور ادھر ہزاروں سینٹری فیوج مشینیں یورانیم کشید کر رہی تھیں. 
مگر چونکہ کہوٹہ سے بھارت کا علاقہ دور نھیں اسلیئے اس انتہائ اہم تنصیب کا دفاع ہمیشہ افواج کے لیئے فکر کا موجب رہا.  اسی دوران 1981 میں اسرائیل نے آپریشن بابل کے نام سے عراقی ایٹمی تنصیبات پہ فضائ حملہ کر کہ انھیں تباہ کر دیا. 
پاکستانی جاسوسی اداروں کو خبر ملی کہ بھارت اب اسرائیل کے ساتھ مل کر پاکستان کی ایٹمی تنصیبات کو تباہ کرنے کا منصوبہ بنا رہا یے اور سر فہرست کہوٹہ ہے.  کیونکہ اگر کہوٹہ تباہ یو گیا تو پاکستان کے فوجی اور سویلین جوھری پروگرام کو یورانیم کی ترسیل بند ہو جائے گی. ایسا ہوا تو بھارت کی افواج کی عددی برتری اور روایتی ہتھیاروں کی برتری کے ساتھ ایٹمی ہتھیاروں کی برتری بھی حاصل ہو جاتی اور پاکستان کا دفاع انتھائ کمزور ہو جاتا. 
کہوٹہ کی تنصیبات اتنی بڑی تھیں کہ انھیں کہیں اور منتقل بھی نھیں کیا جا سکتا تھا. چنانچہ افواج پاکستان کو سرحدوں کا پہرہ کئ گنا بڑھانا پڑا. پاک فضا ئیہ کے جھاز پہلے سے کہیں زیادہ اڑان کرنے لگے تاکہ اگر حملہ ہوا تو فوراً حملہ آور جھازوں کا راستہ روکا جا سکے. 
پاکستان کے فوجی اور دفاعی منصوبہ بندی کرنے والوں کو اس بات کی  ضرورت شدت سے محسوس ہوئ کہ پاکستان کے یورانیم پیدا کرنے والی تنصیبات اگر کسی طرح چھوٹی کر دی جائیں تو مستقبل میں اس قسم کے خطرات کے دوران انھیں چھپانا یا دوسری جگہ منتقل کرنا ممکن ہو. 
پاکستان اٹامک انرجی کمیشن سے رابطہ کیا گیا. اور ان کے ذیلی ادارے NILOP جوکہ 1969 سے لیزر اور دوسرے بصریاتی سائنس پہ تحقیق کر رہے تھے,  انھوں نے کہا کہ ہم ایسا کر سکتے ہیں. 1981 کے بعد  کہوٹہ کے کئی ایکڑ پہ پھیلے سینٹری فیوج پہ مبنی یورانیم کشیدگی کی تنصیبات کو پیداواری صلاحیت کم کیئے بغیر چند کنٹینر وں کے حجم جتنا کرنے کا کام شروع ہوا. 
National institute of Laser optronics 
کے سائنسدانوں نے لیزر کے ذریعے یورانیم کشید کرنے کی خاص تکنیک پہ کام شروع کیا. اس سے پہلے اسی ادارے کے کچھ سائنسدان جو ادھر تحقیقاتی کام کی کمی کی وجہ سے باہر جا چکے تھے, انھیں اس نئے اور بڑے تحقیقاتی کام میں حصہ لینے واپس پاکستان بلایا گیا. اسلاماباد کے قریب موجود اس ادارے کا بجٹ بڑھایا گیا اور اسے وسعت دے کہ یہاں جدید آلات لگائے گئے. 
یورینیم کشیدگی کے نئے طریقہ پہ کام تیزی سے جاری رہا مگر اب پہلے سے زیادہ بڑی اور جدید لیزر لیبارٹری میں نئے اور جدید آلات نے کئی اور طرح کی غیر فوجی نوعیت کی تحقیق بھی ممکن بنائ اور پاکستانی سائنسدانوں کی لیزر کے شعبہ میں مہارت مزید بڑھی.1987 میں دنیا کی سب سے بڑی ایٹمی اور سائنسی لیبارٹری CERN کے سائنسدانوں کا گروہ پاکستان کے عمومی دورہ پہ آیا. انھیں چند پاکستانی جامعات میں لیکچر دے کہ واپس چلے جانا تھا. NILOP کے سائنسدانوں کو ان غیر ملکی مہمانوں کا پتہ چلا تو انھیں اپنی لیبارٹری آنے کی دعوت دی.  جب CERN کے سائنسدان NILOP میں داخل ہوئے تو حیران ہو گئے.  پاکستان جیسے ملک میں اتنی جدید وسیع اور بلند پائے کی لیزر تحقیقاتی ادارے کی موجودگی کا انھیں گمان بھی نہ تھا.  NILOP میں کام کرنے والے انجنیئر,سائنسدان اور ٹکنیشین سے ان کی بات ہوئ تو جیسے ایک کاریگر دوسرے کاریگر کے ہنر کو فوراً جانچ لیتا ہے, CERN کے مہمان پاکستانیوں کے علم اور مہارت سے متاثر ہو کر گئے. 
واپس جا کر انھوں نے دوسرے سائنسدانوں کو اپنے پاکستان کے دورے کے احوال سنائے. CERN نے بھانپ لیا کہ ملک پاکستان کے یہ لوگ بین الاقوامی سائنس کی ترقی میں اہم کردار ادا کر سکتے ہیں. 
1989 میں CERN نے ایک انتہائ پیچیدہ مشین  CMS Compact muon solenoid پہ کام شروع کیا جس میں لیزر کے کئ پرزہ جات لگنے تھے.اس منصوبہ کے لیئے   لیزر کے تمام پرزے بنانے کاکام پاکستان کے ادارے NILOP کو دیا گیا. اور ساتھ ہی NILORE کو CERN میں لیزر کے ذریعے نپائ کر کہ چند انتھائ بڑے سینسر ٹھیک جگہ پہ لگانے کی ذمہ داری بھی سونپی گئی. CMS کا منصوبہ 2007 میں مکمل ہوا اور پاکستانی سائنسدان بھی اس کی تکمیلی مراحل پہ کام کیلیئے CERN میں موجود تھے.  اور یوں ایٹمی اور لیزر سائنس میں پاکستان کی مہارت کا سب کو پتہ چلا.  2007 میں ہی لیزر کے ایک اور اولین موجد اور نوبل انعام یافتہ سائنسدان چارلز ٹاؤنز نے پاکستان اور NILORE کا دورہ کیا. 
دوسری طرف لیزر کے ذریعے ایٹمی ایندھن اور ایٹم بم کے بارود,  یورانیم اور پلوٹویم کی کشید اور افزودگی کے نئے طریقہ پہ تقریباً بیس سال کام جاری رہا . اور 2001 کے قریب پاکستان اس قابل ہوا کہ چند کنٹینروں میں لگے کمپیوٹرائزڈ لیزر آلات سے یورانیم اور پلوٹونیم افزودہ کیا جاتا ہے. اس کام کے لیئے ایک خاص قسم کی لیزر DYE LASER استعمال ہوتی ہے اور سافٹویر بھی پاکستان کا اپنا ہے. اس طریقہ کو Laser isotope separation کہتے ہیں. 
اب پاکستان کی ایٹمی صلاحیت اچانک حملہ کے خطرات سے محفوظ ہیں. 
کسی بھی خطرہ کی صورت میں یا رازداری قائم رکھنے کے لیئے آسانی کے ساتھ ایک جگہ سے دوسری جگہ منتقل کر کہ چھپائے جا سکتے ہیں. 
اور یوں لیزر اب پاکستان کے دفاع میں اہم کردار ادا کر رہی ہے",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/pakistanPKaffairs/photos/a.292029334242591.63714.276691342443057/942558035856381/?type=3,2016-08-04 01:28:15,401,27,101,364,24,13,0,0,0

The 240 Kilometre long Gwadar - Turbat - Hoshab motorway has finally been completed.  The Pakistan army's institution FWO built the motorway in 18 months. 
It may be noted that civilian contractors have abandoned work on the project three times due to workers being killed and kidnapped, machinery stolen and harassment by local tribal leaders. 
The project was initiated 14 years ago but couldn't be completed due to baloch insurgents. 
Eventually Pakistan Army took up the project, brought in the big guns, multiple intelligence based raids arrested  and killed baloch insurgents and ceased weapons and explosives in large quantities.

نسلی اور قبائلی تعصبات کی تاریخ بہت قدیم ہے۔ خالق حقیقی نے نسل انسانی کی افزائش کا سلسلہ ہی کچھ اس طرح رکھا ہے کہ غیر اختیاری طور پر انسان جبلی اور فطری خونی رشتوں میں منسلک ہو تا ہے۔ لیکن اللہ تعالی نے سماجی حیوان کے طور پرمعاشرے میں زندگی گزارنے کے لئے روزاول سے کچھ ایسے اصول بھی عطا کر دیے جو اعزہ و اقارب کو باہم الفت و محبت کا پیکر بناتے ہیں۔ لیکن یہ اصول اس کے ساتھ ساتھ معاشرے میں ایسے فلاحی اور عادلانہ نظام کو بھی ترویج دیتے ہیں جہاں قبائلی اور نسلی تعصبات پروان نہ چڑھ سکیں۔ اور یہ بھی ایک مسلمہ تاریخی حقیقت ہے کہ ان تعصبات کے فروغ میں بنیادی کردار جہالت اور کم علمی کا ہوتا ہے۔ بعثت مصطفویۖ سے قبل کے دور کو کتب تاریخ و سیرت میں ایک جامع لفظ دور جاہلیت سے تعبیر کیا جاتا ہے۔ وہ پورا کا پورا معاشرہ دیگر اعتقادی اور عملی خرابیوں کے ساتھ ساتھ قبائلی اور نسلی تعصبات کی بھینٹ چڑھا ہوا تھا۔ قبیلوں کے سردارقابل احترام مگر انانیت اور نسلی برتری کے خول میں بند تھے۔ اکثر و بیشتر حق و باطل کی تمیز میں رکاٹ بھی ان کی یہی تعصبانہ ذہنیت ہوا کرتی تھی۔ دوسرے قبائل کے ساتھ خاک و خون کا کھیل ایک معمول بن چکا تھا۔ اسی بنا پر چھوٹی چھوٹی باتوں پر جنگ و جدال کا سلسلہ شروع ہو جاتا جو کئی کئی سالوں تک جاری رہتا اور اس میں کئی قیمتی جانیں ضائع ہو جاتیں ۔ شاید اِن اشعار میں ان ہی واقعات کی عکاسی ہے کہ

کبھی پانی پینے پلانے پہ جھگڑا 
کبھی گھوڑا آگے دوڑانے پہ جھگڑا
یونہی ہوتی رہتی تھی تکرار ان میں
 یونہی چلتی رہتی تھی تلوار ان میں

اصلاح معاشرہ کیلئے حضورنبی کریمۖ کے کیے گئے عملی اور دور رس اقدامات میں سے ایک قبائلی اور نسلی تعصبات کا قلع قمع کرنا ہے۔ اللہ تعالی نے سورہ الحجرات کی آیت نمبر تیرہ میں ارشاد فرمایا کہ اے بنی نوع انسان بیشک ہم نے تمہیں ایک مرد اور ایک عورت سے پیدا فرمایا ہے اور تمہاری باہم پہچان اور شناخت کیلئے گروہ اور قبیلے بنا دیے۔ اللہ تعالی کے ہاں تم میں سے وہی قابل احترام ہے جو پرہیزگار اور متقی ہے ۔ بیشک اللہ تعالی جاننے والا اور خبر رکھنے والا ہے ۔ اس آیت کریمہ میں اس بات کو واضح کردیا گیا کہ برادریوں اور قبیلوں میں تقسیم کی حکمت فقط شناخت اور پہچان ہے۔ حقیقی معنوں میں عنداللہ عزت و احترام کا معیار قبیلہ ہے نہ ذات۔ رنگ ہے نہ نسل بلکہ فقط خوف خدا اوراللہ کی ذات سے مضبوط تعلق ہے۔ ایک حدیث مبارکہ میں آپۖ نے فرمایا کہ اللہ تعالی تمہاری صورتوں اور رنگوں کو نہیں بلکہ تمارے دلوں کی کیفیات کو دیکھتا ہے۔ خطبہ حجة الوداع کے موقع پر جب اللہ پاک کی طرف سے تکمیل دین کا مژدہ جانفزا سنایا جارہا تھا تو اس موقع پر حضورۖ نے ارشاد فرمایا کہ کسی عربی کو عجمی یا عجمی کو عربی پر کوئی فوقیت نہیں۔ کسی گورے کو کالے اور کالے کو گورے پر کوئی برتری نہیں ۔یہی وجہ تھی کہ آپ ۖ کے تشکیل کردہ معاشرے میں ایران سے آنے والے حضرت سلمان فارسی، روم سے ہجرت کر کے آنے والے حضرت صعیب رومی اور سرزمین حبشہ سے تعلق رکھنے والے حضرت بلال حبشی ایک اعلی ترین مقام و مرتبہ پاگئے۔ جب حضرت عمر کے دور خلافت میں حضرت بلال کا وصال ہوا تو کم و بیش چھبیس لاکھ مربع میل کے خلیفہ وقت حضرت عمر فرماتے ہیں کہ قد مات سیدنا الیوم آج ہمارا سردار دنیا سے چل بسا۔ ہجرت کے بعد جب ریاست مدینہ کا قیام عمل میں آتا ہے تو وزارت خزانہ کا قلمدان بھی حضرت بلال کے سپرد کیا جاتا ہے جو رنگ کے سیاہ اور آزاد کردہ غلام ہیں۔ اسی طرح مسجد نبوی شریف کے موذن ہونے کی سعادت بھی ان ہی کے حصے میں آتی ہے فتح مکہ کے موقع پر جب حضرت بلال خانہ کعبہ کی چھت پہ چڑھ کے اذان دے رہے تھے تو مکہ کے سردار سٹپٹائے کہ یہ کیا ہو رہا ہے۔ طرح طرح کی بیہودہ باتیں کیں لیکن انہیں معلوم نہ تھا کہ تعلیمات مصطفیۖ نے رنگ و نسل کے امتیازات اور نسلی تعصبات سے انسانیت کو چھٹکارہ دے دیا ہے اور عزت و احترام اور بود و باش کے معیار تبدیل ہو چکے ہیں۔ حقیقت یہی ہے کہ رنگ و نسل اور قبیلہ و ذات تو غیر اختیاری اور فطری طور پر قدرت کی طرف سے عنائت کیے جاتے ہیں۔ جس میں بندے کی خواہش شامل ہوتی ہے نہ مرضی۔ انصاف کا تقاضا بھی یہی ہے کہ اظہار عظمت افراد کی حسن کارکردگی اور اختیاری معاملات میں ہونا چاہیے نہ کہ فقط برادری، رنگ اور نسل کی وجہ سے۔ لیکن بصد افسوس کہنا پڑتا ہے کہ آج ہماری تباہی اور بربادی کے جملہ اسباب میں سے ایک زمانہ جاہلیت کے وہی قبائلی جھگڑے، برادری ازم کی چپقلش اور رنگ و نسل کے امتیازات ہیں ۔ لیکن اسکے ساتھ ساتھ سینے پہ بیج اسلام کا لٹکایا ہواہے جو مصنوعی بھی ہو سکتا ہے اور حقیقی بھی۔

Pakistan does not have spy satellites which can verify if a cruise missile attack has been successful or the missile strayed off target or worse still,  was found out and shot down by enemy air defense. 
To compensate for lack of a surveillance  satellite which can confirm if missile had hit the target or not, a very cost effective and readily available method had been integrated on all Pakistani cruise missiles. 
Basically a civilian satellite phone integrated into missile electronic compartment, which is programmed to send back an ""I am OK"" message. 
If the message Is not received, another cruise missile is launched using a different route.

It was an opportunity ""Out of the blue"" for Pakistan. Despite American demands ,Pakistan kept the missile and it was thoroughly studied. Software was extracted and studied and so was the hardware. At the time Pakistan had already started Cruise missile program and then this happened which propelled Pakistani Cruise missile program years ahead and cut the cost many times. Systems which #Pakistan had to make themselves after much research and expenditure ,simply fell into our laps for reverse engineering.
Pakistan openly said they will study the missile and incorporate any information gained into own cruise missile program.  But American experts said it's not possible to gain any knowledge from a fallen, partially destroyed missile.

Tax revenues is what pays for the cost of any development work in any country.
Unfortunately the tribes stuck to their ancient traditions of not agreeing to any government control and Pakistan army came under constant attacks. Late 1947 decision was taken to withdraw Pakistan army from Tribal areas as it was proving to be a fruitless effort locking up valuable resources which could be used elsewhere.
Tribes were left on their own as that was what they wanted. But while they did not agree on living under the control of a central government like the rest of Pakistan,they couldn't help themselves either and no development work happened in the area. Today in 2015,not much has changed.

The story of most parts of FATA hasn't changed for thousands of years. They want to remain free but wont stop creating problems for everyone around them,in this case growing,manufacturing and smuggling of narcotics. Eventually when those effected,be it Pakistan or a foreign power,takes action,the tribes claim that their lands have been invaded and their freedom compromised and a bloody fight goes on for many years. The ""Foreign invaders"" leave and the tribes get back to their normal business,creating trouble for everyone around them by smuggling drugs,ammunitions and explosives to them.
Now the ""Business"" has gone a step ahead with for sale suicide bombers available in many parts of FATA.
Multiple reports have surfaced where investigation has found out that if you are in contact with the right person,normally a TTP commander,and pay him a few lakh rupees,they will arrange a suicide bomber for you to go destroy a target of your choice.
Not to mention that North Waziristan's capital city the Miranshah Bazar was found full of ""For sale"" Suicide wests,IEDs and military grade explosives which locals made themselves as business venture.

The smart phone runs the software and via that controls the body of the robot. Balance is kept by already fitted Gyroscopes and accelerometers now common in high end smartphones.

C-130 Heavy Bomber

On the night of 11/12 September, the first bombing mission was undertaken by Wing Commander Zahid Butt against the target of Kathua Bridge 16 Kms East of Pathankot. This bridge formed a vital link for the supply line to Indian ground troops. Gauging the dangerous nature of the mission, Chaklala's Station Commander Group Captain Eric Hall also went along on the mission. Flight Lieutenant Rizwan was the navigator. They reached the target safely and during the bombing run, they were attacked by an enemy fighter. Wing Commander Zahid Butt took evasive action only after the bombs had been released. On successful return to the base, they discovered a 1 cm bullet hole in the port wing tip.

After the Kathua bombing raid, the next target for the C-130 bombers was a concentration of enemy tanks and guns, three miles north of Ramgarh in the Sialkot Sector. Two C-130s dropped nine tons of bombs each on the night of 15 September and played a major role in shattering the enemy forces moving up for the battle of Chawinda. On the following night, a single C-130 strike was repeated against Ramgarh destroying enemy tanks and guns as well as ammunition and fuel dumps. 

On the night of 19th September, two successful C-130s sorties were made against Indian Army concentrations in the vicinity of Rurki and Pagowal, and apart from the resulting material damage, the effect on enemy morale was believed to be devastated. 

In the closing stages of the 1965 War, the Indians had amassed their heavy guns close to the BRB canal to concentrate their heavy artillery fire on Lahore. On 21st September a single C-130 dropped ten tons of bombs on the heavy artillery four miles south-east of Jallo. Another C-130 dropped nine tons of bombs on Indian artillery concentration at Valtoha. On 22nd September bad weather hampered PAF strike action against the assembled Indian artillery but the inclement weather did not deter three C-130s taking off that night to find the enemy target and drop their bombs by radar. The target at Atari included an Indian AA Regiment with 72 guns, located in a strip about one mile long running parallel with and close to the BRB canal. The Army was reluctant in giving clearance to the C-130s for fear of breaching the BRB or worse still, the bombs landing on our own troops this side of the canal. Permission was finally granted and the C-130s conducted a highly accurate drop of more than 30 tons of TNT which devastated the Indian artillery. Many independent observers believe this last action by PAF set the Indians clamouring for a ceasefire. Seven officers of the Transport Wing were awarded the Sitara-e-Jurat and 2 JCOSs the Tamgha-e-Jurat.

Some Pakistanis, particularly Pakistani liberals, are also part of this anti-ISI campaign.
To put unrelenting attacks on the ISI in perspective, let's read some excerpts from an interview of ex CIA officer and chief Bin Laden hunter Michael Scheuer on ISI, and watch the following video:

1. ISI is like all other intelligence services--like the Australian service or the American service.

2. ISI works for the interest of their country, not to help other countries.

3. The idea that ISI is a rogue organization is very popular--and even the Pakistanis promote it---but having worked with ISI for the better part of 20 years, I know the ISI is very disciplined and very able intelligence agency.

4. Pakistanis can not leave the area (AfPak) when we (Americans) do. They have to try and stabilize Afghanistan with a favorable Islamic government so they can move their 100,000 troops from their western border to the eastern border with India which---whether we like it or not, they see as a bigger threat.

5. We (US) have created the mess in South Asia and the Pakistanis have to sort it out. Our (US) problems in Afghanistan are of our own making.

6. Al Qaeda has grown from just one platform (Afghanistan in 2001) to six platforms now.

The missile leans at an angle soon after launch and is almost parallel to earth's surface at around 45 seconds after launch.
This indicates something called ""Depressed Trajectory"" or a missile path where the missile simply does not rise too high and maintains a flat path towards target.
Such a trajectory is designed to shorten missile flight time significantly , giving enemy less time to react.

2004 Two chinese engineers were killed by Local Taliban.
2007 work was given to Army for security reasons
2012 construction of main dam was completed,canals were still being built.
2012 , 7 workers were kidnapped,one killed and the rest were kept in captivity for a whole year then released.
2015 Irrigation canals were fully operational.

#zarbeazb
In this video we can see two or one Pakistan Army cobras hunting down terrorists somewhere in Tribal areas. We can also hear Darri language being spoken which is a Tajik/Uzbek language confirming presence of foreign militants in the area.
The eerie thing is terrorists are using a very simple tactic. While the cobra is above them,they are just hiding under a tree and behind walls and apparently the cobra couldn't see them. Then we hear Cobra Gatling gun emptying its bowels on a Building and as soon as the firing stops the terrorists run towards that building just hit knowing that the cobra has fired and wont fire again on the same building.This raises the issue of urgent upgrade of Pakistan's Gunship helicopter fleet with better cameras and optronics.
The other way round is area destruction,or dropping big bombs destroying the whole area,which is done sometimes to avoid similar situations and terrorists getting away.

276691342443057_647732115338976,"If this generation doesn't then I am sure a generation before ours definitely remembers this famous landmark of Pakistan which was called kala chapra (the black hangar).

This hangar was part of a 3-structure complex to house R101 and R102 type airships. The other two structures included a tall mooring mast to dock the airship and in the base of the mast was a hydrogen plant to refuel the airship.

The base of the mast contained buildings followed along the baseline in an octagonal shape. The hydrogen plant had enough gasometers to completely fill the R101 airship with 5.5 million cubic ft of gas.

The construction on this hangar complex started in 1927 and complete in 1929. The size of this hangar was 859ft L x 200ft W x 170ft H. In 1920s Karachi airport area was nothing but a desolate desert. In contrast to that landscape this hangar appeared as such a visual magnanimity that for many years it was used as a visual marker for airplanes attempting VFR (visual) landing in Karachi. Due to the enormosity of this structure to its surroundings, local residents of Karachi started calling this hangar as kala chapra (black hangar) – The word 'chapra' (or 'chappar') has almost become archaic in Urdu used in Pakistan these days. It means a 'shed'. Many current residents of the city who have seen this structure still recall it by its local name 'kala chapra.'The cost of building this hangar complex in 1928 came out to be 93000 British pounds.

So why was this hangar and the adjoining mooring mast complex built in Karachi? It was part of a airship communication scheme of British Government in 1924 to connect far fetched areas of British Empire with a airship service. Big airplanes were not available then and those which were available were noisy, uncomfortable and not suited for long distance travel. The mode of transport which seemed to have best chance then were the airships. These offered quiet and comfortable journey for passengers and could lift heavy cargo too. The Imperial Airship Communications Scheme was thus developed to provide mail and passenger service from Canada at one end of British Empire to Cardington, Englad to Egypt in Africa to Karachi in then India. Another leg was proposed to connect India with Australia later on.

The home base of R101 airships was in Cardington, Bredfordshire England. The mooring mast at Karachi was exactly the same size and style as the one at Cardington (shown below) except for the octagonal building at the base of Karachi mast.

A 777ft long airship called R101 was developed for this service in 1927. The width of R101 airship was 131ft and height was 140ft. Airship mooring masts were erected at St Hubert in Canada, at Ismailia in Egypt and at Karachi which was selected as the terminus in then British India.

The length of the hangar in Karachi was kept 859ft so that it could fit the future R102 model of airships which was going to have a length of 822ft. The hangar however never got chance to host either R101 or R102 airships.

On October 4, 1930 the R101 flew from Cardington, England on its way to Karachi but on its maiden flight it crashed in France. This crash essentially put an end to R101 type airships and Imperial Airship Communication scheme of the British Government. Eventhough the airship program got cancelled, the hangar and mast complex survived for 30 more years.

In 1952, the Government of Pakistan decided to bring down the complex and sell the metal structure for scrap. The structure managed to survive till 1960 when it was finally brought down and steel was sold or used on Railway structures and bridges across Pakistan. This brought an end to the lifecycle of this unique piece of civil engineering in Pakistan.

Location of Black Hangar versus Isphahani Hangar?

One thing I am not sure myself yet is whether the present day wide-body Isphahani Hangar of PIA is located at exactly the same place where once this Black Hangar stood or is it in a different location. I know for sure the general vicinity of both hangars is Karachi Airport but don't know if they shared the exact same spot. Our readers comments and citations are sought here. I'll make the update once we confirm it either way.

Karachi Airport has a railway station on Pakistan's Main Railway track. The station today is simply called 'Airport'. But for few years in the 1920s before Karachi airport was built, this railway station was called 'Airship'.

Video showing formation of an Island as a result of Mud volcano eruption.

On sep 24 2013 a magnitude 7.7 earthquake hit Baluchistan,killing many people. Strange new island appeared of the coast of Gawadar as a result of the earthquake. The island was formed due to a large mud volcano eruption. Mud volcanoes are a blessing,as they are formed as a result of rock grinding due to the tectonic plates sliding past each other. The pulverized rock,mixed with sea water,then goes on to lubricate the sliding tectonic plates,reducing the severity  of earthquakes.
When plates slide past each other,mud is discharged through vents in earth's crust,and they are called mud volcanoes.
Only certain types of rocks are soft enough to be ground,mixed with sea water and then act as lubricants for tectonic activity. If the rock is hard,the plates get stuck,and eventually when they do slide,they slide with immense force and cause much large and violent earthquakes and tsunamis.",MUD VOLCANO,video,https://www.facebook.com/pakistanPKaffairs/videos/516734198438769/,2014-04-09 20:17:45,309,10,346,309,0,0,0,0,0

#Pakistan is one of the few countries in the world where buffalo milk is preferred over cow milk.We are the second largest producer and consumer of Buffalo milk in the world.
Buffalo milk has more nutritional value than cow milk.High in fat (26%) contents and low in cholesterol,it is a source of healthy diet for many Pakistanis.
Special Pakistani breeds like Nili-Ravi and Kundi can produce 15-20 liters of milk a day.

276691342443057_470594743052715,"SHILAJIT OR SALAJIIT
سلاجیت
Picture shows shilajit being dried before sale in  Baltistan.

If you ever been to Northern Pakistan,you may have noticed people selling black or brown lumps of thick resin like mateial.
The vendors will tell you various medicinal advantages of the black matter.

Very little scientific research has ever been done on shilajit.

Similar material of different name is also found in mountains of central Asia and Antarctica.

Salajiit is found oozing out of rocks in Karakoram and Himalayas.

The material has been used in traditional medicines over the centuries.

A closer look at salajiit reveals that it is plant material which somehow got trapped in rock cravasses,remained there long enough to change shape and consistency,and later oozed out when rocks opened up.

The phenomenon can be related to mountain glaciers. Glaciers gather plant material,and often compress this deep inside rocks due to their inherent immense pressure.

When glaciers recede or change direction,the compressed earth slowly bounce back,opening cravasses wide enough to ooze out deposited plant material.

Since glaciers can remain in the same area for hundred of thousands of years,the plant material remains trapped and compressed for same period of time.

Salajiit is different from peate bog or petroleum,although all three are plant material trapped beneath the earth.
Peate bog forms when plants get buried in marshes.For petroleum the same material has to remain burried for millions of years,far below,in the depths of earth.

No two samples of Salajiit are the same.
Some have been found rich in minerals,other samples had glycerols.
For that reason the same medical benefits,if at all,cannot be attributed to Shilajit all over.

Due to the mysterious origin and rarity,ancient herbalists took fancy to the material.
A black paste oozing out of bare rock high in the mountains had mystified people for centuries.
It can be argued that apart from a general dietary supplement,whatever medicinal values have been attributed to Salajiit are a result of ""Placebo effect"".

When Alexander the great invaded the subcontinent,his army was mostly European. His soldiers had never seen monkeys.
When they entered hilly areas of current Pakistan,they saw small men on the trees shadowing them.
The soldiers were petrified by the skills of ""Hairy little people"" jumping from tree top to tree top.
Their commanders ordered the archers to kill the invading "" tree army"".
Many arrows flew,many poor monkey fell dead,and the few survivors were formally captured as ""Prisoners of war"" and presented before commanders for interrogation.
Many hours or days later,the interrogators couldn't understand a word of what the monkeys said in reply to their questions.
Eventually the Alexandrian army realized that these little hairy men are no army with supernatural powers of tree hopping,but these are poor little animals.
With this revelation,the monkeys were set free and the monkey business ended.

As early as over 2000 years ago, the world renowned Silk Road linked the two sides together in a connection. During the 7th century A.D., an eminent Chinese monk in the Tang Dynasty, who travelled westward has mentioned about his fond memory of the land and people in his famous book Records of Western Travels.

Modern age China-Pakistan relations began on 4 January 1950 when Pakistan was among the first countries to recognise the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC). Since then, both countries have placed considerable importance on the maintenance of an extremely close and supportive relationship and have regularly exchanged high-level visits resulting in a variety of agreements.

Cooking is good for the brain. It's now thought that our ancestor, Homo erectus, first used fire to soften meat 1.8million years ago. Because the nutrients in cooked food are more easily absorbed.
Cooking also encouraged us to socialise, which expanded our neural pathways and made our brains grow larger.

PTI activists arrested for manhandling Nato truck drivers
PESHAWAR: Three activists of Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf (PTI) were arrested for their alleged involvement in manhandling truck drivers carrying Nato supplies to Afghanistan near Hayatabad Toll Plaza on Friday.

A private TV channel reported that PTI's District General Secretary Younas Zaheer confirmed the arrest and said the workers were arrested after the party's seventh sit-in in a row blocking Nato supplies in protest against the US drone attacks.

He demanded of police to forthwith release the workers as ""they were protesting against the US drone strikes that killed many innocents and sabotaged the peace process in Pakistan.""

It is pertinent to mention that Provincial Police Chief Nasir Durrani has ordered the police to prevent protesters from stopping trucks.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police also registered cases against 35 PTI activists for manhandling truck drivers. Some 100 PTI protesters reportedly checked shipment documents of trucks, heading to Afghanistan, at the Hayatabad toll booth and also manhandled some drivers.

The cases have been registered against the accused involved in thrashing drivers under Sections 141, 148, 149 and 341 PPC on orders of IG KP at the Pishta Khara Police Station.

    Shahwani said the ban on supplies was causing immense financial losses to oil tanker owners.

    He said the Association was also mulling the idea of organising 'dharnas' (protests) in cities all over Pakistan, or cutting off fuel supplies to Khyber-Pukhtunkhwa in reaction.

    The APOTOA official professed that those engaged in NATO supplies were open to the idea of pursuing alternative sources of income, but the government would have to arrange these for them.

A DARK CHAPTER FROM MUGHAL/COLONIAL ERA HISTORY

THUGS,also known as tuggee refers to the acts of thugs, an organized gang of professional assassins.
They were first mentioned in the Ẓiyāʾ-ud-Dīn Baranī (English: History of Fīrūz Shāh) dated around 1356.
The Thugs would join travelers and gain their confidence. This would allow them to then surprise and strangle their victims by pulling a handkerchief or noose tight around their necks. They would then rob their victims of valuables and bury their bodies. This led them to also be called Phansigar .
In the 1830s they were targeted for eradication by William Bentinck and his chief captain William Henry Sleeman. They were seemingly destroyed by this effort.

In November 2001, the U.S. Navy unveiled a family of three ship designs constituting its Future Surface Combatant Program. Of them, one, the CG(X) air- and ballistic-missile-defense cruiser, was canceled. The second, the small surface combatant later dubbed the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), has been subjected to withering scrutiny—including, on occasion, from your humble scribe. Yet the third, the DD(X) guided-missile destroyer (DDG)—subsequently redesignated —has generated far less heat. To all appearances, the DDG-1000 marks as radical a break as does the LCS from traditional ship designs—maybe more so. Why, then, have the two programs fared so differently in the public eye?

First of all, a straightforward narrative explains the Zumwalts' purposes. For all its bizarre appearance—its low-slung profile, tapering ""tumblehome"" hull, and pyramid-like superstructure misled a friend into pronouncing it a ""cool sub!""—the DDG-1000 remains a familiar ship type, meant to perform a familiar slate of missions. The U.S. Navy has operated DDGs since the advent of shipboard guided missiles in the 1950s. DDGs can be oriented more toward fleet air and ballistic-missile defense, like the workhorse DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class, or more toward shore fire support, like the Zumwalts. These are differences of emphasis, not of kind. Well-defined missions simplify naval officials' messaging and branding efforts.

The trucks will be assembled by a Joint Private Limited Company PAKNOR with brand name of Power Star. Product quality will be ensured by NORINCO, who will train the HR to manufacture and assemble top quality products. The availability of technicians by NORINCO will facilitate production programme in Pakistan. The most significant aspect of the Project would be on transfer of technology basis that will not only bring foreign investment but it will also build capacity of local technicians and create employment opportunities in the industry.

Aiming to dispel rumors of his move to occupy a new, powerful position, the army chief said, ""For quite sometime, my current responsibilities and likely future plans have been debated in the media with all sorts of rumours and speculations doing the rounds. The subject of being entrusted with new duties has also come up in several reports. I am grateful to the political leadership and the nation for reposing their trust in me and Pakistan Army at this important juncture of our national history.

During 1971 Indo-Pak war, the burden of Pakistan Navy's offensive effort hinged on the small but effective submarine force. PN Submarine HANGOR sailed in the early hours of 22 November 1971 to patrol off the Indian Kathiawar coast under the command of Commander Ahmed Tasnim S.J

On 9 Dec, in an effort to locate the evasive enemy, HANGOR extended her patrol northward to investigate some radio transmissions intercepted on her sensors. Two contacts were picked up on passive sonar and were identified as warships. The initial range was 6 to 8 miles. A pursuit of the enemy began but the first attempt to attack these ships failed due to speed disadvantage. The submarine however managed to forecast target ships movement and succeeded in taking up a tactically advantageous position on the path of the patrolling frigates by 1900. At 1957 the submarine fired a down the throat shot with a homing torpedo at the northerly ship from a depth of 40 meters.

When India was partitioned in 1947 about 500,000 people died in communal rioting, mainly along the borders with Pakistan. But a year later another massacre occurred in central India, which until now has remained clouded in secrecy.

In September and October 1948, soon after independence from the British Empire, tens of thousands of people were brutally slaughtered in central India.

Some were lined up and shot by Indian Army soldiers. Yet a government-commissioned report into what happened was never published and few in India know about the massacre. Critics have accused successive Indian governments of an ongoing cover-up.

In some cases the couriers have been directly forced into such trafficking after being abducted and in others family members have been held hostage for coercion to undertake the illegal act. The real drug traffickers, the master-minds, are well-known in Pakistan, and are associated with political parties, and allegedly have a nexus with the Saudi authorities, particularly in Dammam city itself. The drug lords operate openly in the two Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkha (KPK).

Off the record, British officials admit that the process by which he obtained nationality was flawed – a decision in January 1999 to grant him indefinite leave to remain in the UK was made as a result of a ""clerical error"". Despite repeated questions, the Home Office has refused to disclose what that error was.

Most Pakistanis dismiss the idea of a clerical error as risible. They point to a letter No 10 received from Hussain as evidence of how the UK and the MQM have tried to conceal the true nature of their relationship. Written just two weeks after 9/11, in it Hussain says that if the UK wanted hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Karachi denouncing terrorism he could lay that on with just five days' notice. He claimed he could also organise human intelligence on the Taliban and could set up a network of fake aid workers in Afghanistan to back up Western intelligence gathering efforts there.

As water demand exceeds supply in the South Asian country, more and more water is being withdrawn from the nation's reservoirs, leaving them in a critically precarious position. According to the ADB, Pakistan's storage capacity, the amount of water it has on reserve in case of an emergency, is limited to a 30-day supply -- far below the recommended 1,000 days for countries with similar climates.

But in the one decade since the September 2001 attacks and the US led 'war on terror', it has undergone a striking metamorphosis. As Pakistan realises the importance of having a robust maritime force and commits greater resources for its development, the tactics of the PN and its broader strategy in the northern Arabian Sea too have undergone a shift. An enhanced international profile and greater credibility for its role in regional maritime order is gradually resulting in the PN becoming a more confident and assertive player, and a major stakeholder in the regional maritime security regime.

Dr. Ruth Katherina Martha Pfau[1] NQA, HPk, HI (born 1929) is a German[2] nun and a member of the Society of Daughters of the Heart of Mary who has devoted the last 50 years of life to fighting leprosy in Pakistan. In 1996, Pakistan was declared by the World Health Organization to have controlled leprosy, one of the first countries in Asia to achieve this goal

Dr. Pfau was born in Leipzig, Germany in 1929.

In 1960 Ruth decided to dedicate the rest of her life to the people of Pakistan and their battle against Leprosy outbreaks. She came to Karachi and visited a leprosy colony on McLeod Road behind the City Railway Station.

Here she decided that the care of patients would be her life's calling. She started with medical treatment for the Leprosy patients in a hut in this slumquarter.

Dr. Pfau went to the far off areas of Pakistan where there were no medical facilities for leprosy patients. She collected donations in Germany and Pakistan and cooperated with hospitals in Rawalpindi and Karachi.

Ruth Pfau is recognised in Pakistan and abroad as a distinguished human being and has been awarded many prizes and medals. Sister Ruth Pfau was among recipients of civilian awards at President's House on Pakistan Day 23 March 1989. Sister Pfau received the Hilal-i-Pakistan award for her work with leprosy patients. On the occasion of Pakistan Independence Day on 14 August 2010, the President of Pakistan awarded the very high civil award of Nishan-i-Quaid-i-Azam to Dr. Pfau for public service.[9]

The farmers' fields are watered even if electricity remains suspended for days, thanks to the alternative energy solutions. They say they have become an inspiration for residents of nearby villages because of the solar tube-well installed recently.

The tube-well – which cost Rs1.65 million – has been installed by the Rural Community Development Society (RCDS), a non-government organisation, with financial support from the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF). Around Rs320,000 of the total amount was contributed by 10 farming families. Each of the families uses the tube-well to irrigate their land according to a mutually-agreed schedule. The tube-well is operational for around 12 hours a day and irrigates some 40 acres of land.

Other countries listed in the top 10 by the report, which bears the weighty title 'Technically Recoverable Shale Oil and Shale Gas Resources: An Assessment of 137 Shale Formations in 41 Countries Outside the United States' include Russia, Venezuela, Mexico, Indonesia and the United States.

The government needs to develop a plan and strategy with clearly defined objectives to exploit what is an unexpected windfall from out of the blue. Pakistan produced, in 2011, some 63,000 barrels of oil per day on reserves estimated then to be about 300 million barrels. With shale oil included, reserves are up 30 fold. Apply the same production-to-reserve ratio to daily oil output and Pakistan could be producing almost 2 million barrels of oil a day. Imagine what that could do for our country.

LONDON: Britain and America shocked Pakistan and its allies at the 23rd regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council's general debate in Geneva on 7 June when the two countries clearly supported nationalist leader Mehran Marri, Balochistan's representative to the UN, who spoke against the recent elections and alleged that Pakistan was committing rights abuses in Balochistan.

Pakistan is likely to lodge protest with both the countries for taking a hostile position towards Pakistan by intervening on behalf of Mehran Marri who alleged that the recent elections exposed the ""farce that the Pakistani establishment wanted to present as democracy"". The support by the two powerful countries to a Baloch separatist leader will give strength to the view of those who suspect that there are elements within the US and the UK who have sympathies for Baloch nationalist factions for their own regional and strategic objectives.

The coal reserves under the Thar desert lie deep under highly permeable aquifers, almost completely inaccessible with today's technology, and are destined to remain there for the foreseeable future.

Pakistan's greatest energy wealth comes from the sun, much of it absorbed by agricultural crops on some of the most fertile soil in the world. It also has large land areas suitable for solar generation. It has hydro-electric infrastructure that could be used for pumped energy storage, enabling daytime solar-generated electricity to be stored for night-time consumption. Strong and reliable winds along the Arabian Sea coast and over the Himalayas could be used for power generation. How can this vast renewable energy potential be unlocked?

The cost of photovoltaic solar panels has fallen dramatically in the last few years and solar generated electricity has now reached grid parity in many countries. That means the cost of solar electricity is around the same as their grid power prices

He led and took part in the escort operation, which lasted 17 minutes.

Their pride is also shared by the aircraft's Chinese developers.

The increasing numbers of shopping malls popping up all over large cities in Pakistan are creating opportunities not only for large retailers, but also the smaller ones previously involved in doing business in traditional, less profitable ways.

The abundance of centralised shopping areas has led to a change in the social aspect of shopping: shoppers who previously frequented open markets now head to malls for a one-stop shopping experience. Such shopping malls also create a flaming aura of glitz and glamour, attracting wealthy customers like moths and encouraging them to spend from their wealth, helping many businesses grow.

Lahore, the provincial capital of Pakistan's most populous province, has a number of malls that cater to all imaginable clothing needs under one roof, making it easy for customers to find all they require in one place. Whereas people previously headed to unorganised shopping centres and renowned open markets for their clothing needs, such shopping districts rarely housed branded goods, and offered limited choices for customers as far as quality was concerned. The few big names in the clothing industry were considered too posh for the common customer. The shopping mall has changed all that. see more:

The al Qaeda franchise in Pakistan, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), had vowed to target anyone who would participate in the electoral process in Pakistan. Numerous attacks and suicide bombings by the TTP targeted liberal-minded candidates resulting in the pre-poll deaths of over 100 individuals. Despite these overt threats to their security and mercury rising over 35 degrees Celsius, Pakistani voters showed courage and resilience and cast almost 100 million votes (for provincial and National Assemblies) against the al Qaeda's murderous ideology.

The world owes its gratitude to the people of Pakistan who, despite losing over 40,000 lives in the imposed war on terror, continued to fight against religious orthodoxy and violent fanaticism. The results of May 11 elections prove once again that if given the opportunity, Pakistani masses would embrace democracy against the religious orthodoxy.

Nawaz Sharif's PLM-N party, has promised to stop US drone strikes in Pakistan.

The Peshawar high court has delivered a damning verdict on the strikes. Pakistan must now move towards protecting the security of its citizens. Thursday's landmark decision by the Pakistani high court in Peshawar is a remarkable document: Chief Justice Dost Muhammad Khan examines the US use of drones against Pakistan's tribal areas and reaches several conclusions that, while obvious to most sensible observers, seem to have eluded American authorities for several years.

The chief justice's first finding is perhaps the most obvious: ""[Drone strikes] are absolutely illegal and a blatant violation of sovereignty of the state of Pakistan."" The strikes are, he says, international war crimes, given that there is no state of war between the US and its nominal ally, Pakistan.

It does not matter whether General Pervez Musharraf gave the CIA a wink and a nod when he was the country's dictator. ""[T]here is nothing in writing to the effect,"" writes the chief justice. In any event, no government can legitimately authorise the murder of its own citizens – certainly not without a public announcement through the democratic process.

The American use of drones is, in the chief justice's legal opinion, wholly disproportionate under international law. He notes that 9/11 still provides the US administration's pretext for a ""global war on terror"", yet there has been ""not a single … terror incident … anywhere in the USA"" emanating from Pakistan in more than a decade since. How, then, can it be proportionate to kill more than 3,000 Pakistanis, including ""infant babies, pre-teen and teenage children, women and others"".

Nawaz Sharif's PLM-N party, has promised to stop US drone strikes in Pakistan. The court's decision will light a judicial fire under this vow

The death of Sarabjit Singh is a reminder of how India expanded its limited conflict with Pakistan over Kashmir into an all-out animosity.

Executive Summary

This backgrounder offers a clear, concise and uncluttered argument on Indian terrorism against Pakistan since 1950. It is meticulous work that will help researchers in Pakistan, India and the world understand the genesis of Indian animosity toward a neighbor five times smaller that represents no threat to India.


The authors of this document encourage reading the entire dossier to better understand the Executive Summary shown below.


1. Pakistan faced a wave of Indian terrorism in the 1980s and 1990s. The arrest of two spies, Kashmir Singh and Surjeet Singh, and one terrorist-saboteur Sarabjit Singh, came in this period.


2. Way before 9/11 and al-Qaeda, India was the first source of State and Non-State terrorism in the region.


3. Pakistan's dispute with India was limited to Kashmir at the UNSC. Bilateral relations were normal. But India expanded the conflict into other areas in 1950, 1971, 1974 and 2002.

A Secret Deal on Drones, Sealed in Blood ,"" exposes the wanton and deliberate criminality with which the CIA launched its drone murder program in Pakistan in June 2004. Using a missile launched from a Predator drone, the CIA killed Pashtun tribal leader Nek Muhammad—who Pakistan wanted out of the way—and six other people as they were sitting down to dinner, including two children aged 16 and 10.

The episode further exposes Pakistan's ruling establishment, which occasionally denounces the activities of the US military and intelligence agencies in the country, but which in reality is implicated in a long line of backroom conspiracies with the same agencies to murder its own citizens. According to Mazzetti, then-president Pervez Musharraf scoffed at the idea that the public would find out that the CIA was involved. ""In Pakistan, things fall out of the sky all the time,"" Musharraf said.

The C.I.A. had approval from the White House to carry out missile strikes in Pakistan even when the agency's targeters weren't certain about exactly whom they were killing,"" Mazzetti explained. ""Under the rules of so-called 'signature strikes,' decisions about whether to fire missiles from drones could be made based on patterns of activity deemed suspicious.

The latest revelations concerning the CIA's drone murder program in Pakistan confirm the need for the immediate arrest, indictment, and prosecution of all of the top officials in the Bush and Obama administrations on charges of war crimes.

Some called it an artificial creation while others grieved on the vivisection of an ancient land. Yet, no one realized on that fateful night of 14th of August in 1947, that an ancient land has resurrected itself from the ashes of a lost civilization. That night the people of Meluhha came to life again as Pakistan. It was celebrated as an emergence of a new nation on the world map, least realizing that with minor differences in boundaries, the map which housed the people of Meluhha for over 9000 years, simply reclaimed its heritage as Pakistan. Meluhha were the people of Indus Valley Civilization.

The sub-continent has geographically been divided into two major regions since thousands of years; the Indus Valley with its tributaries and the Ganges Valley with its tributaries, separated by the watershed created by Gurdaspur-Kathiawar Salient. The maps of these two regions roughly align with the maps of present day Pakistan and India.

Historically also these two regions have remained separate entities for most part of known history. The only period when these two regions even remained as one political unit in over 9000 years of known history, were during the era of Mauryan, Muslim and British rule. The major historic difference between the two regions was that while the people of Indus Valley created one of the oldest unified civilizations of the world and those of Ganges Valley remained separated and segregated. The Two Nations Theory which became one of the founding principles of creation of Pakistan and partition of British India in 1947, in historical hindsight, helped create status quo ante where history merely repeated itself.

 The changing geo-political dynamics also suggest that access to the foreign defence technologies, particularly in the high end domains, would be either denied or hard to come by in the coming years, said the chief guest.

One critical aspect of the Iran-Pakistan pipeline is the simple fact that it brings together two countries that, if western imperialists were to have their way, would always remain enemies.  Pakistan (a majority Sunni Muslim country) and Iran (a majority Shiite Muslim country), have historically been at odds with one another, choosing rather to align themselves with other Sunni and Shiite countries respectively.  This fundamental conflict has, for more than a century, been at the heart of the imperialist/colonialist strategy. 

Whether British, French, or American, western powers have long dominated the vast energy resources of the Middle East and Central Asia by dividing the Muslim populations along these sectarian lines, exploiting the differences between them in order to prevent independent economic development.  However, the Iran-Pakistan pipeline flies in the face of this ""divide and conquer"" strategy.  Bringing together these two countries through mutually beneficial economic development, the project seems to signal a major change in the Muslim world in the 21st Century.  No longer will the imperialists be able to control the destinies of nations in the region by exploiting their differences.  Rather, it is the imperial powers themselves who will have to reevaluate their strategy and come to terms with a changing world in which their unchallenged hegemony becomes a relic of the past.

Around seventy per cent of politicians, many billionaires, don't pay taxes to discharge their obligations and at the same time ask masses to pay taxes to finance their luxuries, said Dr. Murtaza Mughal, President PEW.

The behaviour of politicians is highly inappropriate which indicates that they take politics as a profitable business and consider country as their landed estate, he added.

He noted that the plunder of national resources and robbing masses has reached to the proportions where the survival of country seems on stake while the ruling as well as opposition parties seem totally unconcerned.

Scientists studying a rare form of glaucoma have discovered why people in the disparate Roma communities are at greater risk of inheriting a condition leading to permanent blindness than other groups in the population. Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a devastating condition affecting 1 in every 1000 Romany people. Researchers at the University of Leeds, looking to uncover the cause, found a single gene mutation repeatedly appearing in affected families. An international collaboration led by Dr Manir Ali of the Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, first identified the 'Jatt' mutation in one of four Pakistani families. Further study amongst Roma populations in Europe showed that the same mutation accounted for nearly half of all cases of PCG in that community. Dr Ali's research also confirms the widely accepted view that the Roma originated from the Jatt clan of Northern India and Pakistan and not from Eastern Europe as previously believed.

And even though my grandparents on the maternal and paternal side obviously cared nothing for sectarian differences (my parents had an arranged marriage), my cousins from my mother's side (we were 10 or 12 at the time I think) would tell me accounts of how the Shia engage in orgies in their Imambargahs, how they spit in the food of their Sunni guests, and all manner of other ludicrous and poisonous nonsense.

My cousins were obviously being fed this poison from other adults or perhaps their peers who themselves were being poisoned by adults they were in contact with, and being exposed to it at a very young age. This is the problem. When children this young are exposed to such poison and their minds warped, whether it be about Hindus, Ahmadis, Shia or Sunni, we are setting the stage for someone down the road to engage in criminal activity against the demonized group.

Again, the issue is not just about poison in society about the Shia, it is about poison being spread about Hindus, Jews, Ahmadi, Shia - any faith. We cannot claim to respect human life and humanity while dehumanizing certain people because of their faith. It is not about Pakistanis 'liking Iran and hating India', it is about Pakistanis respecting and tolerating Hindus, Ahmadis, Jews, Shia and Sunni as equals - people who may follow a different faith but are still entitled to equal status and rights as Pakistanis.

As has been pointed out, the modern nation-states of Pakistan and India were both carved out of what was at the time the British Colony of 'British India'. The entity of 'British India' was itself created through conquest and the purchase of the allegiances, through various means, of the rulers of local States and Kingdoms.

To argue that 'Pakistan was carved out of India' would be to argue that a 'Nation-State' comprised of, roughly, the geographical boundaries of modern day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh existed prior to the British conquest of South Asia, and there is no evidence that this was the case. The argument that 'Pakistan was carved out of India' is a retrospective 'Hindu Nationalist' argument that uses as justification not the presence of a unified political entity, prior to the British invasion, rather argues that the relative religious homogeneity, in the context of the religion of Hinduism and its offshoots, in South Asia indicates 'single nationhood'.

This argument of 'Hindu religious homogeneity in South Asia' as a justification for 'single Nation of India' is just as flawed as the argument by Islamic 'Nationalists' that argue in favor of the 'return of the Caliphate' by stating that the 'Ummah' and 'Islam' are the glue for such a 'unified nation'. ~ Agnostic Muslim",Pakistan: The True Heir Of Indus Valley Civilization – Analysis - Page 20,link,http://www.pakistanaffairs.pk/history-pakistan/10449-pakistan-true-heir-indus-valley-civilization-%96-analysis-20.html,2013-01-07 03:47:35,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0

One speech by Bilawal is all it took for our so called 'liberal elite' to fall head over heels fawning over him - forgotten is the fact that the very same incompetent leaders that have risen to the top as a result of their sycophancy and feudal influence (what was that in Bhutto'e letter to his daughter about ""living in a society where talent is a drawback and suffocating mediocrity an asset..."") will remain in place and indeed be required for Bilawal to take charge of the PPP.

While quoting ZA Bhutto's lament about mediocrity being rewarded over talent in this country forgotten is the fact that in eulogizing Bilawal Saroop Ijaz and many others are in fact doing exactly that which ZA Bhutto warned against - praising mediocrity, sycophancy and personality over demonstrated success and experience (Imran Khan and his lifetime of charitable works across Pakistan).

The Pakistan Navy has test-fired a new land attack missile in the North Arabian Sea off the coast of Pakistan this week.

According to a Navy news release, the test included ""firings of a variety of modern missiles including the maiden Land Attack Missile (LAM)"" and the tests ""demonstrated lethal, precision and efficacy"" of the Navy's weapon systems as well as the ""high state of readiness and professionalism"" of the Navy.

The release also stated the test ""reaffirms credibility of deterrence at sea.""

A Navy spokesman confirmed ""multiple platforms were engaged"" in firing missiles. The firings took place on Dec. 19 and 21.

Though the Navy has a variety of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, the Navy would not confirm the identity of the land-attack missile when asked.

""Coupled with a miniaturized plutonium warhead, a naval version of the several hundred kilometer-range Babur [land attack cruise missile] or a 120-kilometer range C-802 missile can potentially provide Pakistan with a reliable if not an assured second strike capability and will complete the third leg of Pakistan's eventual triad-based credible minimum deterrent — of which the naval leg was missing until now,"" he said.

276691342443057_310938979018293,"What Do We Remain if We Give up Islam - A Reply to @curioususer

    The vision of Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in the 1940s did not constitute a mere power grab at the expense of India's Hindu-dominated Congress party. There was much history and geography behind his drive to create a separate Muslim state anchored in the subcontinent's northwest, abutting southern Central Asia.

    Muslim advent in South Asia began with the concept of al-Hind, the Arabic word for India. Al-Hind invokes the vast tracts of the northern and northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent that came under mainly Turko-Islamic rule in the Middle Ages and were protected from the horse-borne Mongols by lack of sufficient pastureland. To the extent that one area was the ganglion of this Muslim civilization, it was today's modern day Pakistan.

    Rather than a fake modern creation, Pakistan is the very geographical and national embodiment of all the Muslim invasions that have swept down into India throughout its history, even as Pakistan's southwest is the subcontinental region first occupied by Muslim Arabs invading from the Middle East. The Indus, much more than the Ganges, has always had an organic relationship with the Arab, Persian, and Turkic worlds. It is historically and geographically appropriate that the Indus Valley civilization, long ago a satrapy of Achaemenid Persia and the forward bastion of Alexander the Great's Near Eastern empire, was always a separate entity as compared to the rest of India.

    The more one reads this history, the more it becomes apparent that the Indian subcontinent has two principal geographical regions: the Indus Valley with its tributaries, and the Ganges Valley with its tributaries. Aitzaz Ahsan identifies the actual geographical fissure within the subcontinent as the ""Gurdaspur-Kathiawar salient,"" a line running from eastern Punjab southwest to the Arabian Sea in Gujarat. This is the watershed, and it matches up almost perfectly with the Pakistan-India border. Nearly all the Indus tributaries fall to the west of this line, and all the Ganges tributaries fall to the east. Only the Mauryas, Muslims, and British bonded these two regions into single states.

Let us now dissect some long-held myths:

    Myth 1: Pakistan's military eats up the largest chunk of our budget. Not true. The largest chunk goes for servicing domestic debt and the second largest chunk is eaten up by losses at public sector enterprises like the Pepco, PIA, Pakistan Steel and Pakistan Railways.

    The third largest chunk is routinely allocated for the Public Sector Development Programme. In 2012-13, the fourth largest chunk, an amount of Rs545 billion, was allocated for 'defence affairs and services'.

    Myth 2: The military consumes a very high percentage of government expenditures. Not true. In 2012-13, 'Defence Affairs and Services' consumed a meagre 17 percent of all government expenditures. What that means is that a full 83 percent of all government expenditures are non-defence related.

    Myth 3: Over time, our expenditures on the military have been on an increase. Not true. In the 90s, our defence budget used to be 3.6 percent of the GDP. Since then there has been a steady decline. In 2012-13, allocation for defence was under 2.5 percent of the GDP – a 33 percent decline over a decade.

    Myth 4: We spend a very high percentage of our GDP on defence. Not true. There are at least fifty countries that spend a higher percentage of their GDP on defence. They include: India, Egypt, Sri Lanka, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, France, Eritrea, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Liberia, Brunei, Syria, Kuwait, Yemen, Angola, Singapore, Greece, Iran, Bahrain, Djibouti, Morocco, Chile, Lebanon, Russia, Colombia, Zimbabwe, Turkey, Georgia, Guinea-Bissau, Ethiopia, Namibia, Guinea, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Algeria, Serbia and Montenegro, Armenia, Botswana, Ukraine, Uganda, Ecuador, Bulgaria, Lesotho and Sudan.

    Myth 5: The Pakistan Army has received billions of dollars in the form of coalition support funds. Not true. Of the $10 billion that the US claims to have reimbursed to the government of Pakistan, the army has received a total of $1.8 billion (presumably the rest has gone into filling the deficit). Remember; the $1.8 billion is not additional funds for the army but mere reimbursements for expenses already incurred under the 'war on terror'.

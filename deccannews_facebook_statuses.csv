Nation is celebrating birthday of Shaheed Bhagat Singh, the man who sacrificed his life for India's freedom at the age of 23.
Born in a Punjabi Sikh family in 1907 at Banga, Bhagat Singh was among the prominent revolutionaries who shaped the base of a grand national movement. 
Bhagat Singh, an Indian nationalist was considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. 
Singh was born to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati, a patriotic Sikh family, at Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India 
Seeking revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai at the hands of the police, Singh was involved in the assassination of British police officer John Saunders. With Batukeshwar Dutt, he undertook a successful effort to throw two bombs and leaflets inside the Central Legislative Assembly while shouting slogans of Inquilab Zindabad. Subsequently they volunteered to surrender and be arrested. 
Held on this charge, he gained widespread national support when he underwent a 116 day fast in jail, demanding equal rights for British and Indian political prisoners. 
During this time, sufficient evidence was brought against him for a conviction in the Saunders case, after trial by a Special Tribunal and appeal at the Privy Council in England. He was convicted and subsequently hanged for his participation in the murder, aged 23.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/deccannews/photos/a.414024772159.205691.99543192159/10153742198537160/?type=3,2015-09-28 06:12:31,444,5,51,444,0,0,0,0,0

99543192159_10153735840527160,"#DCOPINION: Mystic Mantra: Sacred experience of sacrifice

Id ul-zuha (feast of sacrifice), which marks the end of the Haj, Muslims' annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, is not just a ritual festival. Rather, this three-day-long occasion has a moving spiritual story of sacrifice, submission and supplication to God, evoking deep, humane emotions. It reminds us of our prime task of helping the needy and feeding the hungry. The observance of Id-ul-zuha has been enjoined to inculcate in us the spirit of love, compassion and caring for others.

Going by the Islamic history, this Id is celebrated in remembrance of Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son, Ismail, when God asked him to sacrifice the most precious thing to him. It was none other than his only beloved son whom Allah gifted to him after he spent sleepless nights in constant prayers, asking for a child. However, when Ibrahim had fully prepared to sacrifice his son, God put a sheep in his place. Prophet Ibrahim's infinite devotion and complete submission to the will of God are the core values that Muslims celebrate during Id-ul-zuha.

Thus, they remind themselves of Prophet's willingness to sacrifice anything for the sake of God. Muslims sacrifice the halal animals in remembrance of Ibrahim's devotional sacrifice to God and distribute them to the poor and the less fortunate. However, animal sacrifice is not the core essence of this festival. The holy Quran relays that God does not actually take pleasure in flesh and blood: ""Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you.""

The shrewd businessman brought to cricket administration its first Machiavellian touch. Jagmohan Dalmiya broke the monopoly of the English-Australian axis, seizing the right to host the 1987 World Cup in India and Pakistan. He broke the Doordarshan monopoly holding back Indian cricket, starving it of funds. Along with Punjab's I.S. Bindra, the Cricket Association of Bengal head broke the stranglehold of ""maharajas"" and industrialists who had dominated Indian cricket from colonial times.

Dalmiya ascended to the top in the ICC by garnering the votes of full and associate member countries. He was the principal driving force behind bringing South Africa back into the cricket fold. A stickler for hard work, he aced BCCI activities with a thorough knowledge of regulations, a mastery of its politics and familiarity with the devil in the small print.

The dusty, white fleece covers stretch out over a huge area near the glacier's edge, some in rumpled piles alongside sand, rocks, a few wooden planks and a ladder on its side.

With a red and white Swiss flag providing the only dash of colour, they looks like tents in a vast deserted refugee camp, out of place in the Alpine setting.

But hiding underneath the blankets is a Swiss tourist attraction: a long and winding ice grotto with glistening blue walls and a leaky ceiling that has been carved into the ice here each year since 1870.

""For the past eight years, they have had to cover the ice cave with these blankets to reduce the ice melt,"" said David Volken, a glaciologist working with the Swiss environment ministry, poking at a piece of cloth lying near the path that leads to the cave's opening.

99543192159_10153707336077160,"#DCOPINION: Einstein: The philosopher scientist

By Paulo Coelho

Both the scientist and visionary are the same person. Albert Einstein was able to see way beyond his time and developed a theory that revolutionised the world and the philosophical thought. On the other hand, he was someone who, knowing that the major part of the physical phenomena can be explained, understood that he couldn't comprehend everything.

In today's world, when people have explanations for everything and ridicule any matter that doesn't fit into the small universe they have created, it is worth recalling the words of the greatest and most important scientist of the 20th century. Nothing happens by chance: ""God doesn't throw dice with the Universe.""

Respect toward mystery: ""The most important and most beautiful feeling man can experience is his respect towards mystery; it is the source of all art and science. Those who can't contemplate (the world) with astonishment, have their eyes closed.""

Science and religion: ""I affirm that the cosmic religiosity is the strongest and more powerful among all tools of scientific research. Science without religion is blind. All religions, arts or sciences are fruits from the same tree, whose only aspiration is to turn the life of humans more dignified: that is, allow individuals to rise beyond the simple physical existence and be free.""

About his greatest discovery (using good humour): Sometimes I keep thinking of how I reached the theory of relativity: I think that a normal person never stops thinking in terms of space and time, but as my intellectual development was slow, retarded, I ended up coming to think of time and space only when I was already an adult. How could I explain my theory in a simpler manner? Place your hand on a hot plate for a minute and this will seem to you as an hour. Sit beside a gorgeous lady for an hour and this will seem to you a minute — there you have the theory of relativity.""

Death and the demon (using good humour): ""The most foolish fear of all is the fear of dying, as the dead never face any type of accident. And the worst punishment from the demon was to make us pay a high price for everything good that exists around us: our health is affected, or we torture our soul, or we end up getting fat.""

Finally, a few words on himself: ""It isn't that I am more intelligent or smarter than others, my quality is not abandoning a problem rapidly. When I examine my way of thinking, I reach the conclusion that the gift of imagination always had much more importance to me than the capacity of accumulating information. If I weren't a physic, I would be a musician, because I think like a composer, I look at my life as if it were music. And what regards my personal life, I think that the silent vice is much more interesting than the ostensive virtue.""

Kishwar Desai

Rebekah Brooks is back in the Murdoch fold, as chief executive officer of News UK, (formerly News International). This has to be the greatest story of survival within a highly competitive media, and is a loud anti-establishment gesture of defiance from Rupert Murdoch, who obviously values her work and loyalty, more than the toe curling allegations that followed the phone hacking scandal. Because, thanks to the detailed public inquiry, the closure of the tabloid, News Of The World, and the dreadful allegations about cash-for-stories, there is little we do not know about the red-tressed editor.

We learnt about her private life, about her ""lol"" exchanges with Mr Cameron, about her closeness to Rupert Murdoch. We had guessed she had loads of chutzpah, because she faced all the embarrassment stoically. But that she would quietly head back to the Murdoch empire so soon was not known. Actually she has been cleared of both the charges — of phone hacking and for paying cash for stories. Not so lucky was her colleague, and her alleged one time lover, Andy Coulson, who went onto become Mr Cameron's media adviser.

Found guilty during the inquiry, he spent five months in prison out of a total term of 18. Given her past record, it will be only a matter of time before Ms Brooks pushes this unpleasant period behind her, with much more to prove. Will she try to settle scores with those who belittled her? Only time will tell! Behind those unruly red locks is a lot of determination. Perhaps that's what her boss admires about her — an ability to survive scandals! He has, after all, a similar track record.

The sight of a very young Syrian refugee, Aylan Kurdi, on a beach, has shaken British hearts. Till yesterday, those who were closed to the idea of immigrants coming into the country, are now rapidly changing their minds. Led by an emotional Prime Minister David Cameron, who said that the UK would be willing to take in thousands more refugees from Syria, ordinary British folk are now even ready to open up their homes to these strangers who are fleeing their own. They have offered to keep many of these refugees with them. It is this spontaneous outpouring of sympathy that makes UK unique. People might appear tough, but melt completely if they are needed to be charitable. And it is the same story in much of Europe....

99543192159_10153507397527160,"DC OPINION | India and the yoga jamboree

It is hard to think of any day sought to be commemorated becoming caught up in a web of controversy as the International Day of Yoga, which was internationally marked for the first time last Sunday after Prime Minister Modi called upon the UN to set apart June 21 every year to recall the benefits of the ancient Indian practice.

As an observance, the IDY was a huge success with thousands and the PM himself taking to the yoga mat. But it became clear enough that the hullabaloo was not about yoga, but about Yoga Day, with opponents of the Modi government accusing it of seeking to expropriate the ancient spiritual system as part of the BJP's heritage. Regrettably, that was indeed the message being given out by the party through its spokespersons.

There was also a little ""Hindu"" muscle-flexing in the air by members of the saffron brigade giving the show a soft Hindu communal touch, though people of all religious denominations participated in the yoga event. Hindutva voices ridiculously tried to equate yoga with Indian nationalism, patriotism and Indian citizenship.

A new low was hit when senior BJP and RSS leader Ram Madhav tweeted to suggest that vice-president Hamid Ansari had given the so-called national event the miss. Subsequently, he withdrew the posting with an apology, saying he had not realised that Mr Ansari was indisposed.

This was as gross as it was communal, for the suggestion was that were the V-P not unwell, it was incumbent upon him to make a public show of lending support to the yoga spectacle, for the Sunday show was officially promoted to be nothing but that.

Mr Madhav went to the unfortunate extent of castigating the Rajya Sabha TV channel (since the V-P is the Chairman of the Upper House) for giving short shrift to the yoga jamboree. This was a falsification of facts, as the robust rebuttal of the RSS leader's claim by the channel showed.

Mr Ansari's office also clarified that he was indeed not unwell but had not participated simply because, as per protocol, he takes part in events only when officially invited by a ministry to do so. The massive yoga exercise was administratively handled by the ministry for Ayush.

It was left to the PM himself to strike a non-partisan stance. In a constructive speech, he held that yoga belonged to the whole world. The budget for health and for Ayush has seen a substantial cut. We'll soon know if the official push for yoga is confined to managing an event on a given day.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/deccannews/photos/a.414024772159.205691.99543192159/10153507397527160/?type=3,2015-06-23 05:53:01,189,2,13,189,0,0,0,0,0

99543192159_10153503949282160,"DC OPINION | A long way to go to make our food safe

Multiple cases of high levels of lead and MSG in Maggi noodles has rattled us so much that our nation appears to have woken up to the need for better labelling of foodstuff. It took a major scare that led to the recall of 27,400 tonnes of noodles worth Rs 320 crore to bring us to a point where we will evaluate from scratch the entire process of testing, packaging and labelling of food products that 1.2 billion people consume regularly. There is reason to believe that not only have we in India come to accept some of the world's worst food safety standards, but has also allowed states to have very weak infrastructure. The only positive is that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India is finally looking beyond just more rigorous testing of food.

The FSSAI has ambitious plans to regulate salt, sugar and fat elements in food, force restaurants to list the calorie count of whatever they serve and make the labelling a far more scientific process than now. The FSSAI will also issue guidelines soon on food for schoolchildren. It may take years of back breaking work for panels of doctors, dieticians, nutritionists and representatives of premier food testing institutions to lay out the roadmap for a whole new era of food safety regulations, as well as dietary recommendations, for a population barely aware of what is good for health.

A very significant fact to emerge from the Maggi episode in India as well as the testing by US food authorities of food imports from India, including noodles, is the distinct possibility of excessive levels of lead and pesticides in our food products. The former is probably there in our water while the matter of pesticides can only be tackled by educating millions of farmers, grocers and food processors of the dangers of these deadly chemicals getting into the food chain. A sea change must come about in the very process of crop production if we are to guard the nation from eating its way to ill-health and suffering the resulting damage to the population and the GDP.

Let us not pretend even for a moment that we have a watertight food supply chain, food safety procedures and water treatment processes. Our entire infrastructure must be examined from first principles, on which governments have a moral responsibility as people would like to know where all their taxes are going and whether enough is being pumped into reviewing the most basic resource of life. What is food security really worth if food safety is not guaranteed? Do we need more such branding crises before we act to save ourselves from slow poisoning?

 Suchi Govindarajan 

We at the ministry of unsolicited advice and healthful advertising (MUA-HA) wish you a very Happy International Day of Yoga! We hope you have received at least one or 15 SMS messages this week reminding you to practise yoga. Some of you lucky citizens may have received it daily for the last three days at the auspicious hour of 6 am. You are welcome! We would love to encourage you more often to be early risers. With the right attitude, you too can be punctual, efficient and wise like those of us in government offices.

We took the liberty of sending the messages to everyone in our database, including those on the ""Do Not Disturb (DND)"" register. Dear citizen, this was purely done in your interest, since scientific studies prove that yoga is an antidote against unsolicited spam. With the daily practice of pranayama, you will soon forget your rage at the ineffectiveness of the DND register. Our own government officers have experienced this. One of them said that they used to get very annoyed at SMS ads. ""Friday early morning I used to be getting some nuisance Pest Control ad: '50% off bed-bugs when you book Cockroach Annual Maintenance', like that. But now, when I get such SMS, simply I do Shirshaasana (head-stand) and my anger evaporates through my feet. Plus, I am able to clearly see if at all cockroaches are there hiding under the sofa"".

All are invited to today's yoga demonstrations, regardless of caste, creed, religion, or UK visa status. Some of our Muslim and Christian brethren have been a bit suspicious of our motives. We are very upset and perplexed by this. The way they are going about, it's like we have a history of discriminatory practices or something. Regardless, we have decided to follow the well-trodden path and appease all such minorities. Maybe, after regular yoga, they too will learn to be as open-minded as Hindus.

You may be a little surprised that so many politicians and celebrities have suddenly revealed themselves to be practitioners of yoga. Isn't it amazing? It's like we have even more guru-jis and babas around us now. Now you know where they all get their high principles from. Through sustained practice and penance, they have been able to overcome lowly emotions, and rise high above materialism. This is why you never hear of sex scandals or shady business empires involving yoga gurus. Further, they have been able to awaken their inner divinity and love everyone without prejudice. It is out of this everlasting sea of love and wisdom that they make statements like ""Go jump in the sea if you oppose surya namaskar"" or ""Yoga will cure homosexuality and increase GDP"". Such great role models, all of them.

Although it is firmly rooted in ancient Hindu — sorry, Indian SECULAR — tradition, yoga provides many useful tools for the 21st century politician. For example, asanas like Urdhva Dhanurasana train the body in bending with grace. This is useful for those countless situations when politicians need to bend over backwards, sometimes on humanitarian grounds, to accommodate the rich and the powerful. Asanas that teach the body to contort are useful during news-channel debates. While all others, including the moderator, are shouting at the camera, a yoga-practising politician can simply take some deep breaths and twist the facts.

Finally, since nearly all asanas improve flexibility, politicians can use it to keep their morals agile and flexible to suit any sticky situation. All our political parties, without exception, come from a long tradition of peace and love. Today, they will all come together to promote yoga as the traditional Indian path to world peace. Naysayers may point out that India still ranks in the bottom 25 countries when it comes to peace but we at MUA-HA know that this is not the result of divisive politics or power-play. It is simply because you, dear citizen, aren't doing enough yoga. You are clearly not Indian enough. Hence, our SMS asking you to join us for an hour of simple yoga asanas this morning.

If you don't attend, we will be very upset at your disregard for your health and your nation. More importantly, we may not make it to the Guinness Book of Records. Sure, we may get into the Limca Book, but as you know, that is simply not the same thing as validation from the West. And what could be more Indian than that?

 ""No one knows why the
willow weeps
With its hair dank to the stream
But Bachchoo is glad the
willow keeps
Its secret — unlike
The bore who describes
his dream""
From Moby Dikra (A Parsi Opera)

An article in an English newspaper says that the citizens of Delhi and perhaps other cities will now be paid a rupee every time they volunteer to use a public toilet. The article didn't say how this scheme is to be implemented. As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Gandhian promise to clean up India's streets and unsanitary urban surroundings, the government will, of course, foot the bill.

I suppose, even with the world troubled by terrorism, earthquakes, shady football and cricket deals, corruption, starvation, literary prizes and other disasters, this piece of news attracted the attention of a British editor because in Britain one pays increasing amounts to use public toilets. When I first came to Britain the charge for entrance to a public toilet was famously a penny. An attendant collected the fee and let you in. Over the years, this fee has increased in quantum leaps and now stands at 20 or even 30 pence — which is 20 or 30 rupees!

The entrances to public toilets have been mechanised. You put your money in the slot and the metal barrier opens to let a single person in. The desperate, stingy, bold or impecunious jump over the metal barriers for a free visit, risking arrest and prosecution! When the fee was a penny in the gender-segregated toilets, one would find a very common verse of graffiti scribbled on the walls of the male-toilet booths. It went:

""Here I sit,
Broken-hearted
Paid my penny
And only f____d (a word for passing wind which may not be acceptable in a respectable family newspaper)""

I am intrigued as to how the rupee incentive would be paid for using an Indian toilet. Could one, for instance, go into the same or different toilets in the day a hundred times and garner a hundred rupees? Or do they mark your thumb with indelible ink as they do in election booths to ensure that you don't vote again? But then needing a toilet is not like voting — there's no ban on doing repeatedly. How is toilet-fraud to be avoided?

It must be that the rupee scheme is to apply to towns and cities and not to the rural areas. The government scheme to build public toilets surely starts with the populous cities and then moves to towns and villages. As Mr Modi has noticed, the need for them in the cities is pressing. The old notices which said ""Commit No Nuisance"" were, by and large, ignored as people committed their ""nuisance"" directly under them. Then there was the prohibitive incentive of plastering tiles with religious symbols and pictures of deities to appeal to the fear of divine retribution. This tactic works demonstrably for showers of red paan spittle, but can't be effective against the use of open spaces as toilets.

Talking of which, in Mumbai one night, out for a walk with friends in the tepid summer, we descended from the road to a beach which borders one of the inhabited peninsulas of the north. The moon was bright over the ocean that night and by its light, as we progressed along the beach we could see rows of women squatting at the edge of the waters with brass or other utensils, calling out to each other, talking, laughing and getting on with a mass, ritualised defecation. Modesty and olfactory anxiety made us turn back and get off the beach. These were women, perhaps a hundred of them, from the shanties at the end of the beach. I don't suppose they had a choice of toilets and used the cover of the dark to do their thing where the tides and waves would wash it away.

For the dwellers of Indian shanties the toilets that the government promises will involve a new discipline. For the British public, who have had the facility of pub and public toilets for very many decades, there is no excuse for urinating in the shared hallways of housing estates or in public phone booths. But obviously the London municipal authorities have noted this growing violation and, just as India has ""Commit No Nuisance"" slogans, have plastered posters on phone booths which say ""IS THIS A PUBLIC TOILET? NO!""

The proliferation of McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken fast food outlets has also contributed to free toilet use. These establishments, as restaurants, are legally obliged to provide free toilet facilities to their clients. I have noticed that the workers in these places are much too busy dishing out fried foods to supervise and separate the clients from the people who have dropped in to use the toilet. The other resource is, of course, the five-star hotel. One goes in pretending that you are visiting a guest or have set up a rendezvous in the lobby and then when the receptionists and bouncer are off guard, sneaks off to the perfect facilities.

The present Indian government, through its plans and incentives has openly acknowledged the ""problem"". A few decades ago, V.S. Naipaul wrote An Area of Darkness — his first book on India. He noted with disapproval that Indians used the streets, the railway sidings and very many other places as open toilets. The contention gave rise to deeply nationalistic injury and resulted in published denials, denunciations and even abuse of the writer. The more generous criticism followed the line that he couldn't possibly understand India. The harsher critiques said he was an agent of a neo-imperialism.

The denial on the part of Indians didn't remain absolute. Twenty years after Naipaul's observation, Sulabh toilets began to appear as an Indian initiative to face the issue. Now Mr Modi's government has made ""Swachch Bharat"" a policy aim which should, according to public health officials, go some way towards preserving the health of the nation.

Iconic architect Charles Correa, a true Indian legend who passed away Tuesday night, aged 84, leaves behind magnificent landmarks as a reminder of his extraordinary talent to design public spaces, buildings and a whole new city in Navi Mumbai. Known most for his ""open-to-sky"" concept reflected in many projects he was involved in worldwide, he merely reinforced the thinking that great Indian talent can cross boundaries and leave a mark internationally.

Study and research at the University of Michigan and then at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology may have opened up his mind to heights of creativity, with his fertile imagination allowed free rein. An early success was needed to capture global attention: this came with the Gandhi Memorial in Gujarat, which he designed at the tender age of 28. It is a marvel of understated elegance in keeping with the image of the man who shook the world with the simple principle of non-violence and even simpler ways of life.

Only the best in the field of architecture ever get the chance to design a whole city: Charles Correa's work on Navi Mumbai, the satellite town across the harbour from India's financial and commercial capital, helped him to explore his idea that market forces must be prevented from destroying the soul of cities.

The IMA said that people with rare blood groups can be given blood only from people with the same blood group. In a life threatening situation, such a register will come handy.
The IMA has appealed to all 2.5 lakh member doctors and their patients with rare blood groups, especially of those with the 'Bombay blood group', to enroll on their name, address, email id and mobile numbers. People can also log in and submit their details at the website.
The commonest rare blood group in India is the Bombay blood group. The Bombay phenotype is found almost exclusively in individuals from India, with an incidence of 1 in 10,000. These patients are universal (ABO) donors.

99543192159_10153478032837160,"DC | MYSTIC MANTRA: The power of jyotirlingas

Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev 

Jyotirlinga represents Lord Shiva. It is believed that Lord Shiva manifested himself as a jyotirlinga. There are 12 jyoritlingas — Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleshwar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath Temple at Deoghar in Deoghar District in Jharkhand, Aundha Nagnath at Aundha in Hingoli in Maharashtra, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Ellora near Aurangabad, Maharashtra.

They are located at certain geographically and astronomically significant points. These points are subject to certain forces in the existence. A long time ago, people with a certain level of perception very carefully calibrated these spaces and fixed those points according to the celestial movement. That's the reason why the jyotirlingas are located at those particular points.

Jyotirlingas have tremendous power because they were consecrated and created in a certain way, not just using human capabilities, but the forces of nature.

These temples were consecrated according to the science of energising forms. This is the science of using life energies to enhance human life in a phenomenal way. If you transform mud into food, we call this agriculture; if you make food into flesh and bone, we call this digestion; if you make flesh into mud, we call this cremation. If you can make this flesh or even a stone or an empty space into a divine possibility, that is called consecration.

Unfortunately, we have lost that sense of what consecration really is; all kinds of ridiculous things are happening around it and people have turned it into a business.

While I don't visit temples, I happened to go to the Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain. I could feel the energy reverberating as if the temple was constructed only yesterday. Jyotirlingas are very powerful tools if one knows how to make use of them. If you know how, you can completely reorganise the constitution of your system in the presence of a linga, you can rewire your system completely.

Dr. Radhakrishnan was a strong supporter of education. Instead of celebrating his birthday separately he requested to observe the day as Teachers' Day to give honor to all the teachers in India. This appeal demonstrated his love for the teaching profession and since then 5th September is celebrated as Teachers' Day in India.

Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945), the freedom fighter has inspired many generations. Many scholars think that the death of Subhas Chandra Bose occurred from third-degree burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese plane crashed in Japanese-occupied Formosa (now Taiwan). However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refuse to believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death. Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his death keeping alive various martial myths about Bose. Here are some of the rare pictures.

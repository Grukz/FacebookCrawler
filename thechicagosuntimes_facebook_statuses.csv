47864940833_10153149514505834,"Steinberg: Pope defers to higher power — Donald Trump

What made this episode unique was that it did not stem from a preemptive Trump attack. From his tarring Mexican immigrants as rapists to whack-a-moling war hero John McCain, then POWs in general, then Fox host Megyn Kelly, then mocking a handicapped reporter and suggesting that all Muslims should be barred at the border because, well, they're Muslims, Trump likes to fire first.

Instead, this time it was the pope who, during his trip to Mexico and asked about Trump, unleashed this:

""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian. This is not the gospel.""

Today we proudly introduce the new Chicago Sun-Times which boasts both a new look and expanded news offerings. We have redesigned the newspaper as part of a larger strategy that allows us to strengthen the relationship we have with our readers.
  
Over the past year we asked Chicagoans what they most valued in the Sun-Times and what they wanted more of from their daily reading experience. Today's reimagined newspaper is a reflection of that feedback: more local news, Watchdogs investigations, political coverage, analysis and sports from the best journalists in the city.
  
Readers also told us they want more national and international news on a daily basis.  So we have partnered with the best-read newspaper in the country: USA Today.  We will be providing even more national, international, entertainment, business and national sports news each day.
    
We will continue to curate your daily newsletters with our best digital content under this new and improved brand. In addition, we hope you will take the opportunity to pick up a copy of our print edition and see the changes for yourself.
    
We value your opinion so please e-mail us and tell us what you think at CSTfeedback@suntimes.com.
  
  
Sincerely,

47864940833_10150920875695834,"Here's more on the tragic death of Dr. Donald Liu from reporter Kim Janssen:
He devoted his professional life to saving the lives of thousands of kids.
But one of Chicago's most highly-regarded doctors was off duty and
enjoying a weekend at the beach when he died trying to save the lives
of two children Sunday morning.
Dr. Donald Liu, surgeon-in-chief and professor of surgery and
pediatrics at Comer Children's Hospital, drowned in Lake Michigan in
the effort to save two boys struggling in choppy waters off Lakeside,
Michigan, relatives and colleagues said.
Though the children survived the ordeal and made it safely back to the
beach, the 50-year-old father-of-three was caught in a riptide that
claimed his life around 10 a.m.
   Liu's widow, Dr. Dana Suskind, said they had been spending the
weekend with their children Genevieve, 13, Asher, 10, and Amalie, 7,
at a friend's home in the unincorporated beach community just 10 miles
along the lakefront from the Indiana state line when disaster struck.
  ""He was an amazing man,"" she said. ""We are just all in shock.""
Tributes poured in for Liu Sunday as news of his death spread among
Chicago's medical community.
  ""Don's death personifies a life that was devoted to saving
children,"" the dean of the University of Chicago's Medical School, Dr.
Kenneth S. Polonsky, wrote in an email to colleagues Sunday.
Liu's colleague and close friend Dr. John Cunningham, echoed that
sentiment, describing Liu as ""a phenomenal friend and surgeon.""
""It's meaningful that he was taking care of children when he died,""
Cunningham said.
A second-generation Chinese immigrant whose parents were both doctors,
Liu retained close links to hospitals in China. He joined the
University of Chicago department of surgery as a pediatric surgeon in
2001 and was made chief of pediatric surgery and surgeon-in-chief at
Comer Children's Hospital in 2007.
He was an expert in Hirschsprung's Disease — a congenital gut disorder
— an outstanding surgical oncologist, skilled at removing tumors from
children's chests and abdomens and an accomplished researcher and
teacher who pioneered minimally invasive surgery in children,
colleagues said. Patients across the nation and even overseas would
seek him out, they added.
His many achievements saw him rated one of Chicago's top doctors by
Chicago Magazine earlier this year. He told the magazine, ""Those
children without hope and with diseases that can't be taken care of at
other places — they come here [to Comer]. At the end of the day, the
biggest impact you can make in anything is through kids.""
Polonsky noted that Liu for all his many honors, Liu ""always put his
patients and their families first.""
""Words cannot express the sorrow we are all feeling at this time,""
Polonsky added. ""This is a devastating loss personally and
professionally.""",,status,,2012-08-05 19:26:12,41,24,16,41,0,0,0,0,0

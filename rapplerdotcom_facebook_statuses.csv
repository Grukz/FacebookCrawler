The APSC designed ASEAN to be a rules-based Community of shared norms and values. In addition, it binds the member-states to share in the responsibility for comprehensive security in the realization of a cohesive and stable region in light of the continued dynamism of the world at large.

The ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community gives ASEAN its human face and will work to ensure that it is the people of ASEAN who will benefit from all of these integration initiatives. ASEAN member-states are expected to invest heavily on its people's education, training, science and technology development, job generation, and social protection.

This was the first enrollment, when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
So all went to be enrolled, each to his own town. 
And Joseph too went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David that is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 
to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. 
While they were there, the time came for her to have her child, 
and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
Now there were shepherds in that region living in the fields and keeping the night watch over their flock.
The angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were struck with great fear. 
The angel said to them, ""Do not be afraid; for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. 
For today in the city of David a savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord.
And this will be a sign for you: you will find an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger."" 
And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying: 
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.

Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her. 
When they came on the eighth day to circumcise the child, they were going to call him Zechariah after his father,
but his mother said in reply, ""No. He will be called John."" 
But they answered her, ""There is no one among your relatives who has this name."" 
So they made signs, asking his father what he wished him to be called. 
He asked for a tablet and wrote, ""John is his name,"" and all were amazed. 
Immediately his mouth was opened, his tongue freed, and he spoke blessing God. 
Then fear came upon all their neighbors, and all these matters were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea. 
All who heard these things took them to heart, saying, ""What, then, will this child be?"" For surely the hand of the Lord was with him.

cried out in a loud voice and said, ""Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. 
And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

Have you been attending the Simbang Gabi?

Also known as Misa de Gallo or ""Rooster's Mass"" in Spanish, the Simbang Gabi starts on December 16 and ends on Christmas Eve.

Churches usually celebrate two masses, one at dawn and an anticipated one in the evening. The Advent Wreath by the altar, the Christmas decorations, the lively Christmas songs sung at the end of the mass all make the Simbang Gabi a warm, cozy and memorable affair.

Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, yet unwilling to expose her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly.

Such was his intention when, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, ""Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her.
She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.""

All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:

Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel, which means ""God is with us.""
When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home.

In 2013, a month before Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) struck, the conversation highlighted the use of technology and new media in tackling a key problem: disasters.
Project Agos, a collaborative platform that combines top-down government action with bottom-up civic engagement to help communities learn about climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, was introduced.

Held almost a year after Yolanda devastated most of the Visayas regions, the 2014 Social Good Summit was held in two locations in the Philippines: Manila and Tacloban City, which suffered the most, with more than 6,000 people dead. The Philippine leg tackled the threat of natural disasters and climate change and how a holistic approach – one that involves all sectors of society – is needed to address this.

Rappler, together with the United Nations in the Philippines, will kick off the global Social Good Summit this year through Innovation +SocialGood.

It was a long and rough road to the passage of the RH bill. It's a culmination of the hard work of a battalion of RH advocates - inside and outside Congress - and a President who stepped up to complete the job.

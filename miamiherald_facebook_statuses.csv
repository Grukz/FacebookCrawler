""I see flags from all over here,"" said host Roxanne Vargas.

The 88 contestants showed off their sparkling evening gowns and pink two-piece bathing suits to help the judges select the final 15. There was also a video about the women's time in Doral.

The basketball hoops were up, there were palm trees on either side of the stage and chairs were placed on the court. Hundreds filled the bleachers and floor seats cheering for their countries.

As the women were introduced, the judges and fans learned a bit about them. Some volunteered with homeless shelters. Others are studying to be lawyers and some spoke multiple languages.

At time the cheers drowned out the announcers. Fans from Colombia, Venezuela, Thailand and Mexico held flags and used noise makers.

Florida International University student Karen Rocha, 20, said she was ""proud"" of her school for hosting the pageant.

""This is amazing,"" said Rocha, who was rooting for Colombia. "" This
brings worldwide attention to our school.""

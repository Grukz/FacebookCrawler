618786471475708_943233122364373,"President Obama today at the launch of the My Brother's Keeper Alliance in Bronx, New York:

""Which is why, in addressing the issues in Baltimore or Ferguson or New York, the point I made was that if we're just looking at policing, we're looking at it too narrowly. If we ask the police to simply contain and control problems that we ourselves have been unwilling to invest and solve, that's not fair to the communities, it's not fair to the police. What we gathered here to talk about today is something that goes deeper than policing. It speaks to who we are as a nation, and what we're willing to do to make sure that equality of opportunity is not an empty word.

Across the country and in parts of New York, in parts of New Jersey, in parts of my hometown in Chicago, there are communities that don't have enough jobs, don't have enough investment, don't have enough opportunity. You've got communities with 30, or 40, or 50 percent unemployment. They've been struggling long before the economic crisis in 2007, 2008. Communities without enough role models. Communities where too many men who could otherwise be leaders, who could provide guidance for young people, who could be good fathers and good neighbors and good fellow citizens, are languishing in prison over minor, nonviolent drug offenses.

Now, there's no shortage of people telling you who and what is to blame for the plight of these communities. But I'm not interested in blame. I'm interested in responsibility and I'm interested in results.""",President Obama today at the launch of the My Brother's Keeper...,video,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/videos/943233122364373/,2015-05-04 18:51:01,169,17,28,169,0,0,0,0,0

618786471475708_936582593029426,"How Mississippi Discovered The Drug War's ""Golden Egg""

--- Excerpt Below ---

""I'm fucked, Andy remembered thinking. The agents told him they had photos, and videos too. He wasn't sure how this could've happened. He'd grown up in Oxford, Mississippi, and only bought weed from friends. Yet the agents were telling him they'd caught him making three purchases for a total of 12.3 grams, enough to send him to prison.

""They made it sound really serious,"" said Andy, who, like every defendant in this story, requested anonymity. ""For a little bit of pot, I'd be in there for a long time.""

He first thought about his parents, he said, about how mad they'd get, about how awful it would be to call them asking to bail him out. Then he thought about prison, and it terrified him.

---

FULL NFL STATEMENT:

Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings was advised today that effective tomorrow he is reinstated as an active NFL player and may participate in all scheduled activities with the Vikings.

In a letter from Commissioner Roger Goodell, Peterson was informed that he is expected to fulfill his remaining obligations to the authorities in Minnesota and Texas, as well as the additional commitments Peterson made during his April 7 meeting with the commissioner regarding maintaining an ongoing program of counseling and treatment as recommended by medical advisors.

 Beyond the requirement to comply with his court obligations and plan of counseling, Peterson was reminded that his continuing participation in the NFL depends on his avoidance of any further conduct that violates the Personal Conduct Policy or other NFL policies. Any further violation of the Personal Conduct Policy by Peterson would result in additional discipline, which could include suspension without pay or banishment from the NFL.

Peterson was suspended without pay last November 18 for the remainder of the 2014 NFL season for violating the NFL Personal Conduct Policy in an incident of abusive discipline that he inflicted on his four-year-old son last May. Peterson pled no contest on November 4 in state court in Montgomery County, Texas to reckless assault of the child.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/photos/a.619583664729322.1073741828.618786471475708/934176756603343/?type=3,2015-04-16 13:12:19,22,5,3,22,0,0,0,0,0

""Due to the deteriorating security situation in Yemen, the U.S. Government has temporarily relocated its remaining personnel out of Yemen.  We have informed President Hadi of this step as part of our close coordination with the Yemeni government.  We will continue to engage the Yemeni people and the international community to strongly support Yemen's political transition.  We also continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from Yemen and have capabilities postured in the area to address them.  As we have in the past, we will take action to disrupt continuing, imminent threats to the United States and our citizens.

There is no military solution to Yemen's current crisis.  We urge the immediate cessation of all unilateral and offensive military actions.  We join all of the other members of the Security Council in underscoring that President Hadi is the legitimate authority in Yemen and re-emphasize our support for his efforts to lead Yemen through crisis.  We call upon the Houthis, former President Ali Abdallah Salih, and their allies to stop their violent incitement that threatens President Hadi, Yemeni government officials, and innocent civilians.

We encourage all Yemeni factions to constructively engage in the UN-led political dialogue to achieve an inclusive power sharing agreement.  No unilateral assertion of authority will succeed in Yemen.  We urge a renewed commitment to a peaceful political transition consistent with the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the National Dialogue Conference outcomes, and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.

We are concerned that the well-being of all Yemenis now stands threatened by increasing instability, with extremists trying to capitalize on growing volatility as witnessed in the unconscionable March 20 attacks that killed over 130 Yemeni men, women, and children.  Progress in the political transition process offers Yemen the best hope to address these grave threats.

""It is with deep respect that I express my personal condolences and the sympathies of the American people to the family of King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz and to the people of Saudi Arabia.
 
King Abdullah's life spanned from before the birth of modern Saudi Arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among Arab and Islamic nations.  He took bold steps in advancing the Arab Peace Initiative, an endeavor that will outlive him as an enduring contribution to the search for peace in the region.  At home, King Abdullah's vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world.
 
As our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah's perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship.  As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions.  One of those convictions was his steadfast and passionate belief in the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship as a force for stability and security in the Middle East and beyond.  The closeness and strength of the partnership between our two countries is part of King Abdullah's legacy.
 
May God grant him peace.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/photos/a.619583664729322.1073741828.618786471475708/891913477496338/?type=3,2015-01-22 19:31:46,33,10,26,33,0,0,0,0,0

More:

""Recent terrorist attacks, whether by those affiliated with terrorist entities, copycats, or individual perpetrators, serve as a reminder that U.S. citizens need to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. This replaces the Worldwide Caution dated October 10, 2014.  

The Department of State remains concerned about the continued threat of terrorist attacks, demonstrations, and other violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests overseas. On September 22, 2014, the United States and regional partners commenced military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a designated terrorist organization in Syria and Iraq. In response to the airstrikes, ISIL called on supporters to attack foreigners wherever they are. Authorities believe there is an increased likelihood of reprisal attacks against U.S., Western and coalition partner interests throughout the world, especially in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Kidnappings and hostage events involving U.S. citizens have become increasingly prevalent as ISIL, al Qa`ida and its affiliates have increased attempts to finance their operations through kidnapping for ransom operations. ISIL, al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are particularly effective with kidnapping for ransom and are using ransom money to fund the range of their activities.

--- Full Story Below ---

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The United States on Thursday called upon Saudi Arabia to cancel its plans to publicly whip a human rights blogger, calling the punishment ""inhumane"" and asking the kingdom to review his case.

State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki told the daily press briefing that the U.S. was ""greatly concerned"" by reports that human rights activist Raif Badawi's punishment is set to begin, citing his commitment to freedom of expression and religion.

""The United States government calls on Saudi authorities to cancel this brutal punishment and to review Badawi's case and sentence,"" Psaki said. ""The United States strongly opposes laws ‚Äî including apostasy laws ‚Äî that restrict the exercise of these freedoms and urges all countries to uphold these rights in practice.""

Baddawi was arrested in 2012 for maintaining a blog called ""Free Saudi Liberals,"" a forum for debate and discussion in Saudi Arabia, including ""articles that were critical of senior religious figures such as Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti."" Originally sentenced to face seven years in prison and 600 lashes, a retrial last year actually saw his sentenced increased to 10 years behind bars and 1,000 lashes. Badawi did manage to avoid conviction on a charge of apostasy, which would have carried a death sentence.

The public flogging portion of his punishment is now set to begin tomorrow, with the 50 lashes he'll be dealt repeated weekly for the next 20 weeks.

""It is horrifying to think that such a vicious and cruel punishment should be imposed on someone who is guilty of nothing more than daring to create a public forum for discussion and peacefully exercising the right to freedom of expression,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director, in a statement.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/photos/a.619583664729322.1073741828.618786471475708/884923641528655/?type=3,2015-01-08 16:10:00,137,37,31,137,0,0,0,0,0

--- Full Story Below ---

The Ebola outbreak that plagued several African countries in 2014 is slowing down and even coming to an end in certain nations, but the aftermath of the disease continues to devastate communities, particularly the many children who have been left without parents.

Ebola in Africa has orphaned thousands. Mid-December estimates by UNICEF showed that about 11,000 children had lost parents to Ebola in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia alone, a spokesperson for the organization confirmed to BuzzFeed News.

In one Liberian village, every mother has been reportedly killed by the Ebola virus, The Telegraph reported.

Ebola kills women in far greater numbers, as BuzzFeed News previously reported, largely due to the expectation that mothers and women care for the sick and bury the dead. In August, a Liberian health official estimated that 75% of Ebola deaths were women.

In one Liberian village called Joeblow, a man reportedly carried in Ebola and shortly after transferred it to his wife. Fourteen other mothers in the town took care of the victim and eventually helped bury her. Soon after, they all got Ebola and died. Fifteen children were left motherless, The Telegraph reported.

""It's now a village of no mothers and very confused children with blank looks on their faces,"" said one British aid worker.

""Although it feels like Liberia is coming out of the end of the crisis, it is now dealing with the aftermath, and what it has left behind is huge groups of children who are on their own. ‚Ä¶ When we visited Joeblow, it seemed normal at first ‚Ä¶ But then we realized there were no other women anywhere.""

According to the World Health Organization, 8,235 people have died from Ebola, and more than 20,000 have suffered from the disease. Liberia has been hit the hardest, with 3,496 deaths as of Jan. 6.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/photos/a.619583664729322.1073741828.618786471475708/883086605045692/?type=3,2015-01-06 16:10:47,49,12,19,49,0,0,0,0,0

FULL STATEMENT:

Statement by the President on Hanukkah
 
Over the eight nights of Hanukkah, Jews across America, Israel, and the world will remember an ancient triumph of freedom over oppression, and renew their faith in the possibility of miracles large and small. 
 
Even in the darkest, shortest days of winter, the Festival of Lights brims with possibility and hope.  The courage of the Maccabees reminds us that we too can overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.  The candles of the Menorah remind us that even the smallest light has the power to shine through the darkness.  And the miracle at the heart of Hanukkah ‚Äì the oil that lasted for eight nights instead of only one ‚Äì reminds us that even when the future is uncertain, our best days are yet to come. 
 
May this Hanukkah embolden us to do what is right, shine a light on the miracles we enjoy, and kindle in all of us the desire to share those miracles with others.  From my family to yours, Chag Sameach.

""The President on Tuesday afternoon convened his national security and public health teams to discuss Ebola preparedness at home and the whole-of-government approach to contain the epidemic at its source in West Africa. The President's advisors noted the Department of Health and Human Services-led effort to ensure hospitals and our broader health system are prepared to identify and isolate an Ebola case and, as necessary, stabilize, transport, or treat the patient. The President's team then updated him on the rigorous, multilayered measures in place to screen individuals traveling from the affected West African countries. His advisors also discussed the monitoring requirements to which these individuals are subject upon arrival in the United States. They noted that many states have adopted measures that track closely with the science-based federal guidelines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued last week. On the international front, participants agreed that, despite initial signs of progress in Liberia, we must continue to tackle this challenge aggressively with all of the tools, both civilian and military, at our disposal‚Äîand in close coordination with the selfless health care workers who have admirably chosen to deploy to the frontlines. The President reminded his team that only by containing and ending the epidemic in West Africa will we be able to ensure there are no additional cases domestically.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/photos/a.619583664729322.1073741828.618786471475708/846753455345674/?type=3,2014-11-04 18:46:01,6,1,2,6,0,0,0,0,0

""I am truly overjoyed to hear the news that our Marine Sgt. Tahmooressi is finally coming home to America.

During my last visit with Andrew in a Mexican prison, I told him the next time I saw him would be during his release to America; I am grateful that I will be able to keep that promise and be with him and Mrs. Tahmooressi as he returns to the United States tonight.

Andrew is a brave Marine who served his country with honor, and I have long maintained that he has been held in a Mexican prison for far too long, and needed to be returned to the United States to receive proper treatment for the PTSD that he suffers from as a direct result of his heroic service to our nation.

While I am disappointed that his release did not take place much sooner, I am thankful to Mexican Attorney General Jes√∫s Murillo Karam for displaying compassion for Sergeant Tahmooressi's medical condition.

I want to thank former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson for all his tireless efforts in aiding Andrew's release. Likewise, I want to recognize the support from many of my colleagues, including House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, for all they did to bring our Marine home.

Finally, I want to thank all Americans who have been keeping Andrew in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time for him and his family.  I heard from many of you these past six months and your support was instrumental to his release.

We wish Andrew a safe and happy return to the United States.""

The continued commitment by Israelis, Palestinians, and Jordanians to preserve the historic status quo at this holy site is critical; any decisions or actions to change it would be both provocative and dangerous.  The Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount must be re-opened to Muslim worshipers and I support the long-standing practices regarding non-Muslim visitors to the site, consistent with respect for the status quo arrangements governing religious observance there.

I am in close touch with senior Israeli, Jordanian, and Palestinian leaders to try to deescalate the situation.  I urge the leaders of all three parties to exercise decisive leadership and work cooperatively together to lower tensions and discourage violence, alleviate restrictions on Muslim worshipers, and reinvigorate long-standing coordination mechanisms and relationships that have served over the decades to preserve the historic status quo as it pertains to religious observance and access to the site.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/photos/a.619583664729322.1073741828.618786471475708/843949972292689/?type=3,2014-10-30 17:55:01,6,2,0,6,0,0,0,0,0

""Today, President Obama convened a telephone call with healthcare workers at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas to thank them for their courage and perseverance in dealing with the first cases of Ebola to appear in the United States.  The President conveyed his thoughts and prayers to their two colleagues who were infected with Ebola and wished them a speedy recovery.  He emphasized the importance of integrating lessons learned from Dallas into response plans going forward, and reviewed the additional steps that have been taken to strengthen the Nation's ability to respond quickly and effectively should new Ebola cases emerge.  The President concluded by noting the difficult conditions under which doctors, nurses, lab technicians, and caregivers work on a daily basis in hospitals throughout the country, and praised Texas Presbyterian staff for staying focused on the vital mission of caring for others in times of need regardless of the difficult circumstances.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/photos/a.619583664729322.1073741828.618786471475708/839640646056955/?type=3,2014-10-22 17:44:02,7,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,0

The standard he set ‚Äì a standard for honest, objective, meticulous reporting ‚Äì encouraged so many others to enter the profession.

TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE

September 23, 2014

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)

As I have repeatedly reported to the Congress, U.S. Armed Forces continue to conduct operations in a variety of locations against al-Qa'ida and associated forces. In furtherance of these U.S. counterterrorism efforts, on September 22, 2014, at my direction, U.S. military forces began a series of strikes in Syria against elements of al-Qa'ida known as the Khorasan Group. These strikes are necessary to defend the United States and our partners and allies against the threat posed by these elements.

I have directed these actions, which are in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States, pursuant to my constitutional and statutory authority as Commander in Chief (including the authority to carry out Public Law 107-40) and as Chief Executive, as well as my constitutional and statutory authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States. I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.

Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA

FULL STATEMENT:

Today, we join the European Union in announcing that we will intensify our coordinated sanctions on Russia in response to its illegal actions in Ukraine.  I have said from the very beginning of this crisis that we want to see a negotiated political solution that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Together with G-7 and European partners and our other Allies, we have made clear that we are prepared to impose mounting costs on Russia.  We are implementing these new measures in light of Russia's actions to further destabilize Ukraine over the last month, including through the presence of heavily armed Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. We are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in Minsk, but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that Russia has ceased its efforts to destabilize Ukraine.  

 We will deepen and broaden sanctions in Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors. These measures will increase Russia's political isolation as well as the economic costs to Russia, especially in areas of importance to President Putin and those close to him.  My Administration will outline the specifics of these new sanctions tomorrow. 

 The international community continues to seek a genuine negotiated solution to the crisis in Ukraine.  I encourage President Putin to work with Ukraine and other international partners, within the context of the Minsk agreement and without setting unreasonable conditions, to reach a lasting resolution to the conflict.  As I said last week, if Russia fully implements its commitments, these sanctions can be rolled back.  If, instead, Russia continues its aggressive actions and violations of international law, the costs will continue to rise.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/photos/a.619583664729322.1073741828.618786471475708/817092244978462/?type=3,2014-09-11 11:52:19,22,6,5,22,0,0,0,0,0

More info: http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/08/28/nfl-toughens-its-stance-on-domestic-violence/14746187/

The following letter and accompanying memo, regarding the NFL's new changes to its domestic violence policy, were sent to each of the league's owners today by Commissioner Roger Goodell:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
 
Since becoming Commissioner, my focus has been on ensuring that the NFL is held in the highest regard by our fans, players, business partners, and public authorities.  My commitment has always been to do what is right and to protect the integrity of the game, both now and long into the future.
 
            Recently, we have addressed issues of respect¬≠ ‚Äì respect for co-workers, opponents, fans, game officials, and others.  Whether in the context of workplace conduct, advancing policies of diversity and inclusion, or promoting professionalism in all we do, our mission has been to create and sustain model workplaces filled with people of character.  Although the NFL is celebrated for what happens on the field, we must be equally vigilant in what we do off the field.
 
            At times, however, and despite our best efforts, we fall short of our goals.  We clearly did so in response to a recent incident of domestic violence.  We allowed our standards to fall below where they should be and lost an important opportunity to emphasize our strong stance on a critical issue and the effective programs we have in place.  My disciplinary decision led the public to question our sincerity, our commitment, and whether we understood the toll that domestic violence inflicts on so many families. I take responsibility both for the decision and for ensuring that our actions in the future properly reflect our values.  I didn't get it right.   Simply put, we have to do better.  And we will.
 
            The public response reinforced my belief that the NFL is held to a higher standard, and properly so.  Much of the criticism stemmed from a fundamental recognition that the NFL is a leader, that we do stand for important values, and that we can project those values in ways that have a positive impact beyond professional football.  We embrace this role and the responsibility that comes with it.  We will listen openly, engage our critics constructively, and seek continuous improvement in everything we do.  We will use this opportunity to create a positive outcome by promoting policies of respect for women both within and outside of the workplace.  We will work with nationally recognized experts to ensure that the NFL has a model policy on domestic violence and sexual assault.  We will invest time and resources in training, programs and services that will become part of our culture.  And we will increase the sanctions imposed on NFL personnel who violate our policies.
 
In the past few weeks, I have reviewed all aspects of our Personal Conduct Policy and met with a wide range of experts (several of whom we have been working with for some time), as well as with the NFLPA and many of you. Those discussions will continue.  They have helped us to identify a number of steps that will better communicate our position and strengthen our policies on domestic violence and sexual assault. 
 
These steps are based on a clear, simple principle:  domestic violence and sexual assault are wrong.  They are illegal.  They have no place in the NFL and are unacceptable in any way, under any circumstances.  That has been and remains our policy.
 
Many of you have done excellent work in this field, both personally and through the efforts of concerned players and your community relations and player engagement departments.  Our goals are to prevent violence, impose appropriate discipline, provide professional support resources when appropriate, and publicly embrace a leadership role on this issue. 
 
            Consistent with that view, I have directed the following actions to reinforce and enhance our policies:
 
            First, we will continue our work with leading experts to expand the scope of our education on domestic violence and sexual assault for all NFL personnel ‚Äì players and non-players.  This will include enhanced training for entering players through the Rookie Symposium and Rookie Success Program, as well as new programs designed for veteran players and other NFL personnel. All NFL personnel ‚Äì players and non-players ‚Äì will receive information about available league resources and local support and advocacy groups in their community.
 
            Second, our club Player Engagement Directors, Human Resource Executives, and other appropriate team personnel will undergo comprehensive training to help them understand and identify risk factors associated with domestic violence and sexual assault.  Any person identified as being at risk will be afforded private, confidential assistance.  Persons who decline this assistance will be held accountable for that decision in determining discipline for any subsequent act of domestic violence or sexual assault.  This is a complicated matter and must be approached with care.  We will work with experts to identify strategies based on the most reliable research, recognizing that violence can and does take different forms but generally involves a pattern of coercive behavior. 
 
            Third, we will ensure that the NFL LifeLine and NFL Total Wellness Program are staffed with personnel trained to provide prompt and confidential assistance to anyone at risk of domestic violence or sexual assault ‚Äì whether as a victim or potential aggressor.  Information regarding these resources will be furnished to all NFL personnel and their families.  Our Player Engagement Directors and Human Resource Executives will meet with team spouses and significant others to ensure that they are aware of the resources available to them as NFL family members, including the ability to seek confidential assistance through independent local resources, as well as through the club or the NFL Total Wellness Program.  In this respect, we will utilize our existing, established telephone and on-line programs, and will communicate the full range of available services to all NFL personnel and their families.
           
            Fourth, the outside groups we met with have emphasized that the NFL can play an important role in communities throughout the nation.  Consistent with that advice, we will expand the educational components in our college, high school and youth football programs that address domestic violence and sexual assault. We will seek to create and promote programs that develop the character of the young men who play, coach or manage our game, emphasizing respect for women and appropriate ways to resolve conflicts.  Outreach efforts embodied in these programs will help young people recognize, establish and maintain healthy relationships.  In our earliest contact with young men, we can communicate our expectations, establish NFL standards of conduct, and stress the responsibility that all men have to adhere to those standards.
 
            Fifth, we recognize that domestic violence and sexual assault are broad social issues, affecting millions of people.  We want our public role to be both constructive and effective.  In the coming months, we will explore meaningful ways to incorporate domestic violence and sexual assault awareness and prevention into our public service work.  We will do this with the assistance of responsible outside organizations and the potential participation of current and former players, coaches and families who have been affected and are willing to speak out.  Actions we take in this respect will be sensitive, thoughtful and will recognize the positive role models and high character presented by so many men in the NFL. 
 
            Finally, and consistent with our Personal Conduct Policy, our own response to domestic violence or sexual assault incidents by NFL personnel will include new elements of evaluation, treatment and family support, as well as enhanced discipline.  We will address these issues fairly and thoughtfully, respecting the rights of all involved and giving proper deference to law enforcement and the courts.  If someone is charged with domestic violence or sexual assault, there will be a mandatory evaluation and, where professionally indicated, counseling or other specialized services.  Effective immediately, violations of the Personal Conduct Policy regarding assault, battery, domestic violence or sexual assault that involve physical force will be subject to a suspension without pay of six games for a first offense, with consideration given to mitigating factors, as well as a longer suspension when circumstances warrant.  Among the circumstances that would merit a more severe penalty would be a prior incident before joining the NFL, or violence involving a weapon, choking, repeated striking, or when the act is committed against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child.  A second offense will result in banishment from the NFL; while an individual may petition for reinstatement after one year, there will be no presumption or assurance that the petition will be granted.  These disciplinary standards will apply to all NFL personnel. 
           
            With very few exceptions, NFL personnel conduct themselves in an exemplary way.    But even one case of domestic violence or sexual assault is unacceptable. The reality is that domestic violence and sexual assault are often hidden crimes, ones that are under-reported and under-acknowledged.  The steps we are taking will reinforce our commitment to address this issue constructively.
 
In addition to focusing on domestic violence and sexual assault, we will continue to maintain strong policies regarding weapons offenses.  We are similarly working to strengthen our response to impaired driving.  We have sought ‚Äì unsuccessfully ‚Äì for several years to obtain the NFLPA's agreement to more stringent discipline for DUI, including mandatory deactivation for the game immediately following an arrest and a minimum two-game suspension for a first violation of law.  We will continue to press our position on this issue in the hope of securing the union's agreement.
 
There are three steps that each club should take promptly:  first, post and distribute the attached ""Memorandum to All NFL Personnel"" to every player under contract to your club; second, ensure that your head coach reviews the information in that notice with his staff and with all your players; and third, share this letter and the attached Memorandum with all members of your organization, including your team president, General Manager, Human Resources Executive, Security Director, and Player Engagement Director.
 
            In the coming weeks, we will contact all clubs on further steps to be taken in support of these initiatives.  I am grateful for the thoughtful advice received from so many of you and for the support that I know you will give to this important work.
 
 
MEMORANDUM TO ALL NFL PERSONNEL

 
                Domestic violence and sexual assault are wrong.  They are illegal.  They are never acceptable and have no place in the NFL under any circumstances. 
 
                Our Personal Conduct Policy has long made clear that domestic violence and sexual assault are unacceptable.  We clearly must do a better job of addressing these incidents in the NFL.  And we will.

                Earlier today, I sent NFL owners a letter that identified specific actions we will take to improve our response to domestic violence and sexual assault.  Those actions include the following:

-  All NFL Personnel will participate in new and enhanced educational programs on domestic violence and sexual assault.  We will also increase our outreach to college and youth football programs.

 

-  Families will receive detailed information about available services and resources, both through the club and independent of the club.  These resources and services will be available to employees and their families on a confidential basis.

 

-  Violations of the Personal Conduct Policy regarding assault, battery, domestic violence and sexual assault that involve physical force will be subject to enhanced discipline.  A first offense will be subject to a suspension of six weeks without pay.  Mitigating circumstances will be considered, and more severe discipline will be imposed if there are aggravating circumstances such as the presence or use of a weapon, choking, repeated striking, or when the act is committed against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child.  A second offense will result in banishment from the league; an offender may petition for reinstatement after one year but there is no assurance that the petition will be granted.  These disciplinary consequences apply to all NFL personnel.

                *   *   *   *   *

If you believe that you or someone you know may be at risk of domestic violence or other misconduct, we strongly encourage you to seek assistance through your club's director of player engagement, human resources department, the NFL LifeLine or an independent local domestic violence resource.  Help is available and can prevent potentially tragic incidents.

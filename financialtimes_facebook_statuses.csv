Vladimir Putin will pardon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, finally allowing one of Russia's most famous prisoners to walk free after more than a decade behind bars. Mr Putin said he had come to his decision after receiving a letter from Mr Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, asking for clemency. 

The announcement comes a day after the Russian government granted amnesty to more than a dozen other prisoners whose cases had been criticised in the west as politically motivated. Jailed members of the female punk band Pussy Riot will also be freed, as will Greenpeace protesters who protested on a drilling platform in Russia's Arctic.

In addition, it boosts local consumer spending, which lifts business revenues.

The European Central Bank has fired its magic bullet. By promising ""unlimited"" purchases of sovereign bonds, Mario Draghi, the ECB's president, may have kept his pledge to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro. But in rescuing the currency, Mr Draghi's magic bullet has badly wounded something even more important – democracy in Europe, argues the FT's Gideon Rachman. 

He goes on: ""Since 1945, the central idea of the European project was never again to leave a powerful and aggrieved Germany isolated at the centre of Europe. We are now dangerously close to that point.""

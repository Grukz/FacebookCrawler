Eric Charrette. The mother took the child out of the vehicle, still in its child-restraint seat, and set it on the ground. As she closed the door, she was unaware that the child had gotten out of the seat and crawled in front of the wheel of the SUV. The driver, apparently another family member, drove away, running over the child.

Are you planning to go to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Sunday to view the opening of ""Levitated Mass,"" the exhibit starring a 340-ton boulder from a Jurupa Valley quarry?

I'm going to be there and I'll be looking for Inland residents to interview. 

Museum admission is free to residents of the 73 ZIP codes the giant rock traveled through on its 105-mile journey from the quarry to the museum, where it arrived March 10. Here's a list of the ZIP codes, many of which are in the Inland area: www.lacma.org/sites/default/files/ZipCodeOffer2.pdf 

Please email me at dolson@pe.com if you are planning to be there Sunday -- or even if you may go later in the week (admission is free through July 1).

And if you're someone who still can't understand why so many people are so excited about a big rock, I'd like to hear from you as well.

50855317267_10150725583722268,"The art of managing the elements was almost as important as the ability to drive fast and turn left smoothly yesterday at The Track Formerly Known As California Speedway, according to PE columnist Jim Alexander.

More from Jim: ""Oh, by the way, the official NASCAR attendance estimate -- the organization and its tracks never give precise figures -- was 90,000, which would suggest 75,000 in the grandstand. Not sure I buy that. My eyeball estimate at the start of the race said 60,000 in the grandstand, which seats 92,000 at full capacity but had 14 sections (between 8,000 and 9,000 seats) covered by tarps.

Bottom line: The non-sellout streak for NASCAR Cup races is 16. But let's just say Fontana has plenty of company on the circuit these days when it comes to empty seats.""

The 45-acre Corona Breeding Farm, near Lincoln Avenue and West Rincon Street, is long gone. But more than 50 years later, the 4,400-square-foot Spanish-style ranch house that Arnaz helped design still exists. If all goes as planned, the structure soon could become a meeting and event venue in Eastvale. Come take a peek inside Desi's old pad.

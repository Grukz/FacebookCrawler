They are also offering the lucky winners the chance to come onto the pitch during half time in front of thousands of rugby fans to take part in a once in a lifetime 'Up and Under' catching competition to win TEN tickets to the SSE SWALEC Finals Day on Sunday May 1. 

For a chance to win, help the player catch the ball in the video by hitting pause to stop the ball in the yellow zone. Then get a screen grab and post the proof.

Beware though... it's pretty tricky!

Dan Black gave the £20,000 he raised to Brecon's family to help pay for expensive life-changing treatment for the five-year-old.

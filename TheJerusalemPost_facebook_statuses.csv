The name ""Haggadah"" comes from the concept of Vihigaditah, which appears in the book of Exodus. The verse is usually interpreted as, ""And you shall tell your child.""  
 
The great Jewish, medieval philosopher, Maimonides, famously asks whether one is obliged to read the Haggadah if alone when conducting the Seder.  He answers that the Commandment still prevails in that circumstance. The explicit reason is that there is an inherent value derived from articulating the story, but the implicit rationale for this Maimonidean ruling is that there is a child present even in that scenario.

It follows, therefore, that ""The Jews"" had to get even with the Catholic Church, while at the same time deflecting attention away from Israeli injustices against the Palestinians.

Most fundamentally, US military aid to the Middle East harms Israeli and regional interests by fueling an arms race that threatens to spiral out of control. Recent Israeli-produced estimates reveal that for every dollar in US aid received by Egypt, Israel must spend between $1.60 and $2.10 to maintain its qualitative military edge.Since Israel is usually granted $1.50 for every $1 in aid to Egypt, each American dollar given to Egypt costs Israel between 10 and 64 cents out of its own pocket.

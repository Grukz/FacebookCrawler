The photo should not have been selected as the photo of the day. Because of the timing of the post at 11:30 p.m., very few were involved in its selection. The process of selecting photos for this feature will be changed going forward.
With regards to the image remaining on this post, Facebook does not allow the editing of images after publication of a post. This left us with two options, to delete the post entirely, or provide context as we have in this case. Because of the comments on this post, we felt that removing the post entirely would be less transparent.
Since Officer Jones shot Jerime Mitchell on Nov. 1, The Gazette has extensively covered the case. We are continuing to push for additional records to be released through administrative and legal channels.
The Gazette chose to cover the dodgeball event as a longstanding fundraiser with interaction between the CRPD and area students. We were unaware Jones would be in attendance.

On December 11, 1994, the Gazette reported with the frontpage headline ""What Next for U of I"" the departure of University of Iowa president Hunter R. Rawlings III, who was then announced as Cornell University's 10th president. University of Iowa's future president David Skorton would later leave the University of Iowa to succeed Rawlings. In between Rawlings and Skorton, Mary Sue Coleman served as president before leaving for the University of Michigan in 2002. 

This photo shows Rawlings photographed by a Gazette staff photographer during his tenure at Iowa.

In preparation for the National Railway Historical Society's national convention in Cedar Rapids June 17-25, we're (the Gazette? SourceMedia?) taking a look at the railroads' role in the development of the Cedar Rapids-Iowa City area and Eastern Iowa.
We'd like to hear from local residents old enough to recall traveling by rail to and from Eastern Iowa, who worked for the railroads here, or who recall when Cedar Rapids' Union Station was still in business. We're especially interested if you have old photos or other local souvenirs of the railroad era.
If you or someone in your family are would like to participate, we'd like to hear from you. Call Steve Gravelle at (319)398-5819, or contact him by email at steve.gravelle@sourcemedia.net.",,status,,2012-05-14 13:42:03,7,2,1,7,0,0,0,0,0

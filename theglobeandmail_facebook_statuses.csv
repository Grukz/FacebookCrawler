As rock nuptials go, the marriage of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love was a low-key affair. At the time, Cobain was front man for grunge-rock phenomenon Nirvana, while Love was only slightly less famous as the guitarist/vocalist for the band Hole. Their impromptu ceremony was held on a cliff overlooking a Waikiki beach before eight guests, including Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. The groom wore flannel pyjamas, while the bride wore a lace dress that had previously belonged to actress Frances Farmer. The wedding made headlines worldwide, as did the birth of their only child, Frances Bean, six months later. ""Courtney and Kurt are the nineties, much more talented version of Sid and Nancy,"" said one unnamed music executive in a Vanity Fair profile later that year. Amid rumours of excess and drug addiction, the couple's punkrock romance came to a tragic end two years later when Cobain took his own life.

The first powered aircraft flight in Canada, and indeed in the British Empire, took off from an ice-covered Baddeck Bay, N.S. The Silver Dart looked outwardly similar to the Wright brothers' famed aircraft, which made its historic flight a few years earlier in December, 1903. The Canadian aircraft was built by Alexander Graham Bell (yes, of telephone inventor fame) with John McCurdy at the controls. It's listed as being made from such basic materials as bamboo, steel tubes and rubberized fabric, which gave off a silver sheen that inspired the plane's name. Its first successful flight travelled only about 800 metres with a peak altitude of just nine metres. The original aircraft made the first passenger flight in Canada in August, 1909, but the Silver Dart was damaged beyond repair soon after and never flew again.

Preparation for the purge started even before 3G's Burger King bought Tim's for $12.5-billion in December, 2014.

Before the deal closed, dozens of vice-presidents, directors and other senior staff were called in, one by one, to meet with Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz, who would lead the merged company, RBI.

Each employee had just 15 minutes to justify their corporate existence. Some of the meetings lasted as little as five minutes. Some took buyouts. 

But once the merger was officially sealed on Dec. 12, other, more senior, managers began to disappear.

Then, early on Jan. 27, 2015, RBI executives gathered in a boardroom dubbed the ""command centre."" On a large screen was a detailed schedule that showed — in 20-minute increments — when hundreds of Tim Hortons employees were due to be fired.

Robert Pershing Wadlow came into this world weighing 8.7 pounds, but by his first birthday, he was 3 1/2-feet tall and 45 pounds. Diagnosed with hyperplasia of the pituitary gland, he reached six feet by the age of eight and just kept growing. Although Wadlow accepted the inevitable public attention - even touring with the Ringling Brothers Circus in 1936 - his affliction exacted a terrible physical toll, including a weakened immune system and minimal feeling in his lower extremities. In June, 1940, Wadlow's height was measured as 8 feet 11.1 inches tall. Several days later, he developed an infection from a blister caused by an ankle brace. Despite blood transfusions and emergency surgery, he passed away soon after at the age of 22. Nearly eight decades later, Wadlow remains the tallest person in human recorded history.

War hero, artist, knight, medical pioneer. Frederick Banting accomplished a great deal in his 49-year life, but will forever be associated with the discovery of insulin, for which he shared the Nobel Prize with John Macleod in 1923. However, Banting did not set out to blaze a trail in the field of diabetes research. One night, as he was preparing for a planned lecture at the University of Western Ontario, he happened across a research paper that inspired an epiphany: If he could isolate a secretion from the pancreas believed responsible for controlling blood sugar, he may find the key to controlling diabetes - at that time, an untreatable, fatal disease.
Crude experiments would eventually pay off and Banting became a household name, elevated to legendary status following his death in a Newfoundland plane crash on Feb. 21, 1941.

The sixties had been good to Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, but by 1965, he was ready to put the group's surfing-themed pop origins behind him. Wilson intended for Good Vibrations to appear on their ambitious album Pet Sounds, itself a feat of ""wall of sound"" production techniques. Little did he know when tape first rolled on this day that it would take another seven months and $50,000 in studio costs. Session musicians and bandmates alike marvelled at Wilson's ability to find the perfect instrument for his ideas (here a cello, there a Hammond organ), commit them to tape and then piece together the song from more than 90 hours of recordings. Good Vibrations is often referred to as a ""pocket symphony,"" and it would be the last U.S. No. 1 single Wilson would write.

But neither he nor the company he left in 2013 are quite the same now.

Only Mr. Péladeau knows for sure if he's returning to his old job for the right reasons. 

But he already appears to have identified his first mission: saving Quebecor's media empire.

With a tap of his chisel against a stone wall, archeologist Howard Carter opened a crack just big enough to peek through and, in doing so, unleashed a frenzy of popular interest. This moment had been more than a decade in the making, with Carter's long search for Tutankhamun's tomb having exhausted the patience, if not the pocketbook, of his wealthy sponsor, Lord Carnarvon. Undisturbed for 3,000 years, this was the most intact Egyptian tomb ever found, packed with so many material and intellectual treasures that it required more than 10 years to catalogue them all. Still, the star of the show was undoubtedly the boy king himself, with his story inspiring countless tales, movies, songs, documentaries and museum exhibitions over the ensuing decades. Even today, nearly a century later, King Tut remains known worldwide, with his death mask still a symbol for the entire field of Egyptology.

Whether it's your teddy, bunny or lamb-lamb, stuffed animal toys were birthed from a less cutesy place: politics. Inventor Morris Michtom named his stitched creation after then-U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt and placed the very first ""teddy"" in a store window on this day 114 years ago. The origins story of the toy stems from a legend around one of Roosevelt's hunting trips. It's said the president came upon an injured bear tied to a tree. Some say he shot the bear, while other historical references suggest he set it free. Whatever the truth, the stuffed offspring from that tale became an instant hit; plush toys have become a $1-billion industry in the United States. The teddy bear has since evolved, spawning dozens of colours, sizes and variations from high-end collectibles (think $10,000 Gund bears) to low-end, dollar-store trinkets.

On this day, 5,000 asbestos miners in Quebec's Eastern Townships walked off the job in a fight for better working conditions.
Their demands included a wage of $1 an hour and reducing workers' exposure to the deadly dust. Quebec's then-premier Maurice Duplessis, known for anti-union policies, declared the strike illegal and sent in provincial police.
After several months, at a time when Quebec supplied 85 per cent of the world's asbestos, U.S. employer Johns Manville Co. began to hire replacement workers; violence escalated on both sides of the dispute. The four-month strike is seen as a milestone in Quebec's labour history, demonstrating the clout of the francophone majority in a turning point that some historians say paved the way for the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. It marked, as Pierre Trudeau later wrote, ""a violent announcement that a new era had begun.""

On Feb. 9, 1971, a major earthquake shook Los Angeles, and the next day an even larger one shook the music world with the release of Carole King's second solo album, Tapestry. Recorded in just three weeks, featuring King and her cat Telemachus on the cover and friends Joni Mitchell and James Taylor singing backup, it would win four Grammys, sell 25 million copies and stay on the Billboard charts for five years. As the world hummed You've Got a Friend and I Feel the Earth Move, the album sat at No. 1 for 15 weeks, a record for a female solo artist that stood for two decades. King would later say that the upheaval of the 1970s drew fans to her music: ""People around the world have told me Tapestry helped them reconnect with basic human feelings when they really needed that.""

In the winter of 1996, he was racing indoors to improve his slow starts ahead of the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. At the Reno meet, contesting the unusual indoor distance of 50 metres - 60 metres was standard - Bailey set a world record of 5.56 seconds. ""To be one of the best sprinters ever, that's what I'm working for,"" Bailey said afterward. There was controversy, questions whether he jumped the gun, but the record stood. Six months later, Bailey had sprinted into history. He won Olympic gold in the 100 metres with a world-record time of 9.84 seconds and won a second gold for Canada in the 4x100-metre relay.

Everyone knew the magnitude of this home game against the Detroit Red Wings. Toronto's hold on the final playoff spot was at stake and no Maple Leafs team had ever lost 10 straight games. A scoreless first period provided some hope for coach Punch Imlach's team until the wheels fell off in the second. Detroit's Norm Ullman netted a natural hat trick in less than 3 1/2 minutes and Toronto couldn't recover, losing 5-2. Imlach would be hospitalized a week later for exhaustion. ""Losing 10 games in a row really frazzled him up,"" assistant coach King Clancy said. It may have served as a wake-up call, as Toronto rebounded in time to make the playoffs and win the Stanley Cup that year: an underdog champion and the last Cup winners Toronto has seen.

Feb. 7, 1964: The cultural history of the world changed the moment Pan American Flight 101 touched down at New York's Kennedy Airport at 1:30 on the afternoon of Feb. 7, 1964. Three thousand shrieking teenagers greeted The Beatles' maiden trip to North America, less than 2 1/2 months after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. By then radio stations had been stoking Fab Four furor for weeks, thanks to a pre-recorded Capitol Records interview that let every rock 'n' roll DJ in the country sound like he was interviewing the mopheads in his studio, while I Want to Hold Your Hand sold 2.6 million copies and hit No. 1. Two days later, 73 million people (almost 40 per cent of Americans) witnessed the Liverpool lads' upbeat charms on TV's The Ed Sullivan Show. Music – to say nothing of the country's mood, or what constituted a successful marketing campaign – was never the same again. – Ian Brown

The discovery of gold on John Richardson's farm in 1866 near Madoc, Ont., northwest of Kingston, prompted a gold rush in the region that was in full swing by 1867. In early February, The Globe described several gold finds in the area, one of them on ""Mr. Martin's lot, adjoining Kellar's Bridge, about two miles north of the Richardson mine."" The reporter had seen with his own eyes a sample from another site on the Bobcaygeon road, ""proving beyond a doubt that gold really exists in the townships north of Lindsay."" The story added a note of caution, because ""scarcely a day passes but we hear of some fresh discovery having been made. As a general rule, however, the discoverers are very chary about imparting any particulars, lest they should lose the reward of their skill, labour, and patience."" There wasn't actually much gold though, and within a few years the boom had fizzled.

Among Second World War spies, German physicist Klaus Fuchs was in a class of his own. Fleeing Nazi persecution in the early 1930s, Fuchs settled in Britain, where he picked up his PhD and communist sympathies. With the outbreak of war, he was interned in Britain - and later Sherbrooke, Que. - as an enemy alien. It was after a fellow physicist secured his release to work on Britain's atomic-bomb program that Soviet agents enlisted Fuchs to pass secrets. He continued after being tapped to work on the Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapons. Five years after the war, the FBI discovered he was a spy. On Feb. 3, British authorities arrested him and he served nine years in prison. Nobel-winning nuclear physicist Hans Bethe said: ""Klaus Fuchs is the only physicist I know who really changed history.""

The act is short - just 232 words packed with consequences. In the glow of near-victory by separatists in the 1995 referendum, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien proposed and Parliament passed the Act Respecting Constitutional Amendments. British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario gained a veto over constitutional changes. Atlantic provinces representing a majority of their people could team up for a veto. Saskatchewan and Manitoba were at the mercy of more populous Alberta for the Prairie veto. Few were happy with the result.
The ""desultory package of constitutional leftovers"" described by one Globe and Mail columnist was layered on the Constitution, which required seven provinces representing at least 50 per cent of the population for most changes.
Constitutional reform was already difficult; the new math made it nearly impossible. No politician has dared test either formula with a Constitutional amendment since 1983.

A pioneer in the rationalist school of philosophy, René Descartes is best remembered for his remark Cogito ergo sum: ""I think, therefore I am,"" as well as his groundbreaking work in mathematics. By 1650, Descartes was employed as a tutor by Queen Christina of Sweden. On Feb. 1, he caught a cold, the beginning of an illness that ended with his death 11 days later at the age of 53. The cause of Descartes's death went down in history as pneumonia, but researchers have always wanted more details, with subsequent theories suggesting his demise was because of Stockholm's frigid climate, the strain of his duties and even arsenic poisoning. Through his philosophy, Descartes sought to know the unknowable with logic and reasoning. More than 350 years removed, it's unlikely the exact circumstances of his death will ever be fully known.

Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah had a famously uncertain pathway to fame. He struggled for years to write it, at one point smashing his head on the floor of a hotel room trying to finish it. Cohen was said to have written 80-plus verses. After presenting its accompanying album, Various Positions, to his record company in the mid-1980s, they declined to release the record, forcing Cohen to put it out independently. Its reception was lukewarm.
Then the Velvet Underground's John Cale covered Hallelujah for a compilation record in 1991. When a young songwriter named Jeff Buckley heard Cale's version, he released his own in 1994 - then died tragically three years later, propelling the song to classic status. Cohen's first live performance of Hallelujah has its own uncertainties, hindered by archival setlists' availability.
The most widely circulated date? Jan. 31, 1985, at the start of the Various Positions tour, in Mannheim, Germany.

Jan. 30, 1867: Salacious murder trials were popular newspaper fare in the mid-19th century, as they are today. In late January, 1867, there was widespread coverage of the trial of Rev. Jeremie Babin, a Church of England minister in the village of Buckingham, Que., on the north shore of the Ottawa River. He was accused of killing his disabled sister, Mary, who had come to live with him and his wife. In April, 1866, Mary was taken out of their house in the middle of the night under mysterious circumstances, and her body was later found in a nearby river.

It's a treaty that brought arms control to the moon. As the Cold War foes of the 1950s built, tested and deployed an ever-growing arsenal of nuclear weapons, perhaps it was inevitable they would look to the heavens.

Space offered enemies the promise of unmatched vantage points for missiles as well as untouched planets on which to amass weapons of mass destruction, the thinking went. Such fears were fed by Russia's highly secretive space program that was tied to its military. But an agreement signed on this day by the United States, Soviet Union and Britain prevented the arms race from reaching space. The Outer Space Treaty declared the moon and other celestial bodies were to be used only for peaceful purposes and that there would be no claims of sovereignty on any planet. Astronauts, the pact read, were to be regarded as ""envoys of mankind,"" never enemy combatants.

While flying to Canada from Tunis in 2002, he was detained in New York on suspicion of being linked to al-Qaeda. The Americans deported him to Syria where he spent a year in a cell the size of a grave, sharing space with rats between bouts of torture. His wife launched a campaign for his release and, in October, 2003, he was freed to return home.

140961138903_10154928107183904,"Moment in time: Jan. 25, 1996 - Victim of Alberta's eugenics program wins landmark lawsuit:
It was a sweet moment for a woman who had seen so much sadness in her life. Misdiagnosed as a ""mental defective"" and sterilized without her knowledge, Leilani Muir sued the Alberta government in 1993. In a ruling three years later, she was awarded $740,000 in damages, opening the door to financial settlements for other victims of the province's eugenics program.
From 1928 to 1972, the Alberta Eugenics Board authorized the sterilization of up to 3,000 people. Muir, who had an abusive mother, was packed off to a province-run school when she was 11. After a single, misleading IQ test, her fallopian tubes were removed. After her court victory, she changed her family name to O'Malley, to break with her past. She was a human-rights advocate until she died last year.

A boy in Christian Nelson's Iowa confectionery shop couldn't decide between ice cream and a chocolate bar. That's when the light bulb went off. Nelson set about finding a way to bind chocolate to ice cream (cocoa butter would be the key). His ""I-Scream Bars"" were such a hit at a local picnic he partnered with a chocolate maker named Russell Stover to mass produce them.
It was Stover's wife who came up with the name ""Eskimo Pie."" The patent, which would later be declared invalid, originally covered any type of frozen material covered with candy and even the word ""Pie."" Financial problems would eventually force the sale of the company. Now, the bars are sold by Nestlé and are not as popular as they once were. After all, there are a lot of ice cream bars and as delicious as they might be, that name might leave a bad taste in people's mouths.

More than 20 miles was complete, The Globe reported, and everyone who rode the new stretch noted its ""remarkable smoothness and ease with which the cars travel"" and the ""immense strength as well as the beauty of the masonry along the line of road."" Work was about to begin on another branch to the Annapolis Valley - a project that ""in conjunction with Confederation, would certainly double land values in Western Nova Scotia,"" The Globe said.

But if you thought it was already unclear what that shift would look like, this week's contradictory signals took the view to a whole new level of murky.

About the only thing that's becoming clear is that what was already shaping up to be a year of change for currency markets is getting more uncertain and volatile – and that could complicate the struggling global economy in any number of ways.

It would be a mistake for Canadians to think of this approach to trade as the impulse of a deal maker, like a 3 a.m. tweet.

Technically, it wasn't Canada. With Princess Juliana of Holland scheduled to give birth there, the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital had been declared extraterritorial. That way, the royal newborn would be Dutch, full stop. Dual nationality might have compromised the baby's place in the line of succession - and for the House of Orange-Nassau, this was an anxious time. Shortly after the Nazi invasion of her country, Princess Juliana arrived in Canada to live out the war with her daughters. Technicalities aside, Princess Margriet became the first and still the only royal to be born in North America. She was named after a type of daisy that had become a symbol of the Dutch resistance. When Canadian soldiers liberated Holland two years later, her mother thanked the family's adoptive home with another famous national flower, by sending 100,000 tulip bulbs.

It was an otherwise forgettable game. Little did fans know the 45-7 rout of the Indianapolis Colts by New England Patriots in the AFC championship would devolve into one of the biggest controversies in National Football League history. After it was discovered that underinflated balls were used in the game, everything from the ideal weight of a football to what Patriots superstar quarterback Tom Brady was hiding in his text messages - which he refused to relinquish and later destroyed - became topics of debate. Blame fell initially on a low-level Patriots equipment manager, but Brady and his head coach, Bill Belichick, became the face of the scandal. After a protracted investigation bordering on the absurd, Brady was suspended for four games. That ban led to a year-long legal battle, ending in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where it was upheld.

When Britain gave the world the Beatles, the United States responded with the Monkees. NBC fast-tracked creation of the sitcom/pop quartet that began with a Variety ad seeking ""four insane boys age 17-21."" After screening more than 400 respondents, producers settled on the prefab four: Guitarist Mike Nesmith and bassist Peter Tork were low-rung folk fixtures, while drummer Micky Dolenz had never played the drums and Brit import Davy Jones stuck with vocals and tambourine. The Monkees kicked off NBC's 1966 fall season and was an instant ratings hit - and even presaged the modern music video since every episode interpreted at least two songs. The show also sustained a flurry of top-10 hits, including Last Train to Clarksville and I'm a Believer, but by early 1968 the novelty had worn off and the Monkees were relegated to the remainder bin.

J'accuse...! The headline appeared in large bold type on the front page of France's L'Aurore on this day. In an open letter addressed to the French President, celebrated writer Emile Zola railed against the trumped-up treason charges and conviction of army officer Alfred Dreyfus. Zola hoped his letter would bait authorities into suing him for libel so that he could expose the anti-Semitism and corruption of the court-martial. They did. He lost the case, and fled to England, while Dreyfus was transported to the notorious Devil's Island and placed in solitary confinement. In 1906, the verdict was annulled and Dreyfus proclaimed innocent. The army took almost a century from his conviction to do the same. In 1995, it publicly admitted the Dreyfus affair was a ""military conspiracy"" based on false evidence against an ""innocent man.""

From any angle, the camera loved Corey Haim. The Toronto native was still in grade school when he cut his teeth on the CBC series The Edison Twins. In short order, Haim was appearing in films such as Silver Bullet and Murphy's Romance before his breakout in the 1987 feature The Lost Boys. Even in a cast that included future notables such as Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Feldman, Haim commanded attention. For the next few years, Haim worked steadily but fell into a spiral of drug addiction. By the midnineties, he was relegated to low-budget features such as Snowboard Academy.
Haim reunited with Feldman for the 2007 A&E reality series The Two Coreys, which largely chronicled the formers' efforts to stay sober. In March, 2010, Haim collapsed at his mother's L.A. apartment and died soon after at the hospital. He was 38.

Instead, it was the singer Psy who galloped to the milestone in only five months with Gangnam Style.

""You know, we've got all sorts of shortages these days,"" Carson told viewers. ""But have you heard the latest? I'm not kidding. I saw it in the papers. There's a shortage of toilet paper!"" Panic ensued. People started hoarding the stuff. Stores raised prices and imposed purchasing limits. The more toilet paper flew off shelves, the more it made the myth look true. Finally, Carson had to address the matter.
""I just picked up an item from the paper and enlarged it somewhat ... there is no shortage."" We fret about fake news on Facebook today, but we've always been gullible. Nothing can wipe that fact away.

Instead, director John Badham introduced the world to the wonder that is Tony Manero via the Bee Gees tune Staying Alive, and the rest is cinematic history. At the height of its buzz, Saturday Night Fever was deemed the musical of the century, disco was a never-get-old sensation and star John Travolta could do no wrong. These truths would all be handily overturned within a decade. (The film is far grittier and music-less than most remember; disco would be declared ""dead"" on July 12, 1979, at Chicago's Disco Demolition Night; and Travolta would soon be making goo-goo eyes at wisecracking babies in Look Who's Talking.)

But, on a flight to Paris from England on this day in 1944, his plane went missing and he was presumed dead.

Ralph Klein engendered wide support in part because Albertans believed him sincere, and very human. He drank and gambled, and said as much.  He was also decisive and had superb political instincts.  And he was lucky – oil and natural gas prices mostly trended upward through his 14 years in office. When Klein became premier, it was a repudiation of the PC party establishment and a call to action on tackling the growing debt. His government moved quickly with an agenda of spending cuts and privatization. Though many said Klein lacked long-term vision, small-c conservatives still miss his focus on the bottom line and his reverence for the ""Marthas and Henrys"" of Alberta. In the end, Klein backed down only when necessary – and not often. ""You can call me every rotten, stinking name under the sun, but I ain't going to blink.""

When Steven P. Jobs was 25 years old, he filed a prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to take public the computer company he co-founded with his pal Steve Wozniak a few years earlier in 1976. Apple Computer Inc. wanted to sell about 4.6 million shares for about $22 (U.S.) each with hopes to raise about $82-million - they actually raised $100-million and the shares sold out immediately. Comparing that prospectus with recent results reveals what a good deal those shares were. In 1980, the company held four patents. Today, it holds more than 10,000 and files for about 2,000 a year. In 1980, Apple spent $7-million on R&D, compared with $10-billion in 2016. In its 1980 fiscal year, Apple recorded $117-million in revenue. At the end of 2016, it announced $215-billion in revenue, and $45-billion in net income. Jobs is gone, but in its 40th year, the company is going strong.

Six years after it left Earth, NASA spacecraft Galileo reached Jupiter on this day. Named after Italian Renaissance-era astronomer Galileo Galilei, it was the first spacecraft to orbit the enigmatic gas giant and study its atmosphere. The orbiter had previously launched a probe to penetrate dense, turbulent cloud cover and relayed data about Jupiter's weather and air composition, among other things. And when the orbiter arrived at the planet, the probe descended into the atmosphere at a speed of about 250,000 km/h. Exactly two years later, the mission was extended but shifted focus to Jupiter's moons, where it discovered a possible ocean of water under Europa's icy crust and a lava fountain on Jupiter's innermost moon, Io. The orbiter's mission eventually ended in 2003 when it was purposely plunged into the massive planet.

Macdonald's justice minister and indispensable lieutenant - ""my one great discovery,"" Macdonald called him. He refused the prime ministership when Macdonald died, knowing the party would resent his Catholicism, but soon succeeded the ailing John Abbott because there was simply no one else. Quiet, tolerant, rigorous, passionately nationalist, reluctant to dispense or receive patronage, Thompson gave Canada its first criminal code.

It seemed like just another game among the several hundred that would be played in the 1975-76 NHL season. The visiting Boston Bruins won 6-4 over the New York Rangers, with Boston's Bobby Orr, the previous season's scoring champion, counting a goal and an assist. The next day, the greatest defenceman ever to play the game - perhaps the best player at any position - tried to stand up in a Boston restaurant and his left knee locked.
Two days later, he was on the operating table. ""I never played another game as a Bruin,"" he wrote in Orr: My Story. He came back to be MVP of the 1976 Canada Cup, but his knees worsened in the 20 games he managed over three seasons with the Chicago Blackhawks. At 30, he was finished.

It was a Friday evening around suppertime when the biggest earthquake to hit eastern North America in more than half a century struck.
The convulsion, whose ripple effects were felt as far away as Detroit, Boston and the Annapolis Valley on Nova Scotia's western shore, resulted in surprisingly little damage and no one was killed or seriously injured. But many people feared the worst as windows shattered, walls cracked and a landslide caused a hole along Route 172 in Quebec (pictured below). Media outlets reported a deluge of calls from anxious citizens. The epicentre of the quake - a 5.9 on the Richter scale - was located near Chicoutimi, Que., in the Saguenay region about 150 kilometres north of Quebec City. There were scattered power outages. A former City Hall in Montreal East was left with severe damage to its masonry cladding. For Geological Survey of Canada scientists, the event provided a bonanza of research material helpful in updating the building code.

On a hot and dusty morning in the Afar region of Ethiopia, American paleoanthropologists Donald Johanson and Tom Gray were heading back to their Land Rover after surveying a fossil site. Johanson spotted a small piece of bone lying on the slope of a gully. It proved to be the tip of an elbow.
Nearby, they located fragments of a skull, a femur, pelvis, ribs, vertebrae and a lower jaw. The spectacular find would eventually yield a 40-per-cent complete skeleton that belonged to an upright-walking female from a previously unknown species of hominin called Australopithecus afarensis. While Johanson and his teammates were celebrating at camp that night, a cassette with the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds played repeatedly, inspiring the fossil's nickname. Buried in sediments deposited some 3.2 million years ago, Lucy is a precursor to, and possible direct ancestor of, the genus Homo, which includes humans.

But as Nichols puts it, William Shatner declared, ""If anyone's going to get to kiss Uhura, it's going to be me - I mean Captain Kirk."" The director panicked once he realized its interracial nature.
Network executives were consulted and it was decided to shoot the scene twice: one with the kiss, one without. There were 36 takes in total, most of them used to redo the kiss. Eventually, there was only time to shoot the nokiss ending twice. The next day, it became clear which ending they had to use: Shatner had crossed his eyes in the only usable version of the kiss-less shot.
Despite concerns of backlash, Nichols says she received ""one of the largest batches of fan mail,"" all of it positive.

Edison, a prolific inventor whose legacy includes light bulbs and motion pictures, made his first recordings at his New Jersey laboratory on a contraption with a drum covered with paper. His phonograph would be improved and better marketed by others, but the wonder of Edison's records remains - every groove containing a microscopic landscape of peaks and valleys that hold and reproduce music in a way many enjoy even after the waves of more convenient mediums that have followed. Fittingly, even the first song Edison recorded has proved enduring - Mary Had a Little Lamb.

Traders cheered on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 1,000 - hitting 1,003.16 - for the first time in its 76-year history. Obviously, the surging Dow meant the economy was headed upward - or did it? Within months, a vicious bear market would maul stock prices, knocking them down as much as 40 per cent.
A cavalcade of economic and political woes, ranging from oil crises and Watergate to spiralling inflation and stagnant growth, would keep the Dow mired in three-digit territory for most of the following decade.

The must-see movie at the Festival of Festivals (now the Toronto International Film Festival), The Big Chill generated both glowing reviews and lineups at the box office. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, the story focused on a group of former college pals reunited when one of their classmates (played by Kevin Costner in a fleeting funeral scene) dies by suicide.
Boasting a cast that included Kevin Kline, Glenn Close and William Hurt, the film details a boozy, pot-fuelled weekend as the baby boomers reminisce, rekindle old flames and wonder what happened to their Summer of Love ideals. Although it received three Oscar nominations, including one for best picture, the film drew more public attention for its sixties-era soundtrack, best remembered in the scene where the ensemble preps dinner to the Temptations's 1966 hit Ain't Too Proud to Beg.

Canadian Pacific Railway wanted to use the land ""for docks, warehouses and buildings,"" but Vancouver's founding fathers saw something more promising in the thick, green rain forest cloaking the peninsula at the entrance to the harbour. Instead of industrializing the site, the first city council, at its first meeting, passed a resolution asking Ottawa to lease it to Vancouver as a park for all time. Ottawa agreed, and for the annual fee of $1, Stanley Park, a 400-hectare oasis, was created. Named after then-governor-general Lord Frederick Stanley, it opened in 1888. The seawall walkway, totem pole display, rose gardens, aquarium, beaches and bike paths now draw eight million visitors a year. In 2014, TripAdvisor named it the best park in the world.

The movement had no real name at first, just an idea: Hong Kong needed to be able to choose its own chief executive, the city's powerful top leader, without interference from authoritarian China. But when a group rallied around the city's legislative complex, police responded with pepper spray on Sept. 26, 2014, and, two days later, with tear gas. The protesters used umbrellas as flimsy shields. The images of a harsh crackdown, and fears that it had been directed by Beijing, galvanized the Umbrella Revolution. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets, shutting down the central business area for months. They failed to end Beijing's oversight of the chief executive selection process. But they gave birth to a new independence movement, which sent four candidates to the local legislative council earlier this month.

Marley collapsed the next morning during a jog in Central Park; in hospital, he learned that cancer had spread throughout his body.

After some of the music industry's biggest stars managed to turn the world's eyes to the plight of Ethiopian famine victims in 1985, Bob Dylan suggested some of that attention might well be focused on the plight of family farmers. American farmers were struggling under crushing burdens of debt, depressed commodity prices and dropping land values while, paradoxically, harvests were at record levels. The situation prompted Willie Nelson to approach the governor of Illinois about holding a benefit concert. Nelson, John Mellencamp and Neil Young combined to host the first Farm Aid, a 12-hour concert that brought together the three organizers, plus Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Waylon Jennings, Kenny Rogers and Joni Mitchell. The concert raised $9-million, a tiny fraction of the $55-million raised by Live Aid. But Farm Aid is in its 31st year, having held the 2016 concert earlier this month in Virginia.
The headliners? Young, Mellencamp and Nelson, who is now 83.

Yes, there's a fierce dragon and great battles, a powerful wizard and hidden treasures, but at its heart, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a small story. First published in 1937, when he was a middle-aged academic at Oxford, Tolkien's first novel is now a classic of both children's and fantasy writing. It tells the story of a simple-hearted hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his cozy hobbit hole and ventures out, with a baker's dozen of dwarfs and a wizard to reclaim a vast treasure from a malevolent dragon named Smaug. Partway through the novel, separated from his friends and lost in the tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a strange ring - a moment that would eventually form the foundation of Tolkien's masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings.

Before several thousand spectators along the River Clyde, the Queen introduced the ship and declared, ""May God bless her and all who sail in her,"" before pushing the button sending a bottle of champagne smashing into the behemoth's bow. Although the Queen Elizabeth 2 was conceived as a posh cruise ship - it had more than 1,000 cabins, along with multiple cocktail bars and nightclubs - the craft was pressed into military service in 1982 when it was used to transport British troops during the Falklands War.
The Cunard cruise line retired the ship in 2008, but plans to convert it into a luxury hotel stalled. At last check, the QE2 was rusting away in a Dubai harbour.

The emoticon as we know it - an anthropomorphic expression generated by digital type or code - is an artifact of the digital age. Inventor Scott Fahlman posted it on an early Internet university message board at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh at 11:44 a.m. on Sept. 19, 1982. We even know why: Digital communication needs more than words to express the nuance of feelings. Fahlman's :-) was a joke indicator, and :-(was a ""for serious"" marker. The emojis and emoticons popular on social media today share a direct lineage to that concept: There are ""crying laughter"" emojis to denote mockery and fire emojis to highlight a hot takedown. There's some evidence the :-) symbol existed before Fahlman popularized it, but he is responsible for its modern, digital function.

For the hockey world, it was a dark day that eventually became a dark season. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced the 2004-05 season would be delayed because of a work stoppage, two days after Canada won its first World Cup of Hockey in front of a full house in Toronto. At issue was the NHL's desire for a salary cap to control player salaries, something the NHL Players' Association fought bitterly for the next five months. The deadlock led to a cancelled season, a first for any major North American pro sports league. The result: the NHL broke the union, with long-time executive director Bob Goodenow forced out as players acquiesced to Bettman's demand. The cap-based linkage system that was instituted the next season remains largely intact 11 years later.

When Isadora Duncan danced, it was an elegant, free-spirited revolution. Barefoot and wrapped in flowing, Greek-inspired costumes, Duncan rejected the conventional rigidity of ballet. She was a pioneer of modern dance, wowing - and sometimes shocking - audiences with her bohemian moves (and philosophies - feminism, free love, Communism). Born in the late 1870s in San Francisco, Duncan left California for Chicago, New York and then Europe - where she was a sensation. She founded dance schools; her students were dubbed ""the Isadorables."" For all the light and ecstasy in her dance, her life was heavy with tragedy. Her two young children drowned when their car fell into the Seine. Another baby died. She later married a Russian poet who killed himself. Duncan's life itself came to a tragic end: While riding in a convertible, her long scarf became entangled in the back wheel, killing her.

Perhaps the best of the several stories about the discovery of the Lascaux cave art in southwestern France involves a dog named Robot.
Seems the mutt was romping in the woods with four teenage boys when a rabbit caught his eye. Pursuit ensued, with the rabbit ducking down a hole.
Curious, the boys dropped stones into the hole to get a sense of its depth.
Then, screwing up their courage, they began to wiggle through the opening, discovering it was actually a narrow shaft 15 metres deep. Could this be, they wondered, a tunnel to treasure? The answer was yes. Except the trove wasn't gold francs but hundreds of vivid images of Paleolithic beasts, rendered with great skill and sophistication 17,000 years ago on a warren of cave walls.
Picasso would visit this ""prehistoric Sistine Chapel"" and leave it stunned and humbled. ""They've invented everything,"" he said.

Percy Williams defied the odds - and his doctors - to become the world's fastest human. After surviving a bout of rheumatic fever in his early teens, the slight Vancouver native was told by physicians to avoid all forms of strenuous exercise. Instead, Williams trained as a sprinter and earned a place on the Canadian Olympic team that competed at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam, where he won gold in the 100- and 200-metre events. Williams's finest hour came two years later at a Toronto track meet, where he ran the 100 metres in a scorching 10.3 seconds - a world record that would stand several years until broken by U.S. track star Jesse Owens. Sadly, Williams's running career, and life, went downhill in years to follow. Stricken by depression and arthritis, he took his own life in 1982.

He coined the term ""Rainbow Nation"" and, after apartheid's defeat, headed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that tried to heal its wounds. Unlike many liberation heroes who fell into corruption, Tutu has remained a moral beacon since his retirement, speaking out bravely against government abuses, poverty and injustice at home and worldwide.

In baseball's unrelenting 162-game season, there's no time to rest or recover. So eventually, even the best players yield to injury or age and take a day off - except for Cal Ripken. Over more than 16 years, the stoic Baltimore Orioles infielder didn't miss a game. And while he was a first-ballot Hall of Famer who hit 431 home runs, his most memorable performance was just another day at the office. On Sept. 6, 1995, with U.S. President Bill Clinton looking on, the 35-year-old shortstop surpassed Lou Gehrig's hallowed streak by playing in his 2,131st consecutive game. When the record became official, halfway through the fifth inning, his teammates pushed him forward and the Iron Man ran a slow, joyful victory lap, celebrating a feat that now seems beyond comprehension - in 2015, only one player managed to play every game.

Sales slumped 23 per cent in August from July, and were down 26 per cent compared with a year earlier. In fact, the supposedly booming Vancouver housing market is suddenly generating sales that are below the 10-year average for the month.

But the numbers deserve attention beyond the mere schadenfreude it will certainly illicit from some observers outside of Vancouver or even British Columbia. And there's a danger in reading too much into this single month of data – especially given that those data appear to confirm the worst fears of some observers, David Parkinson writes.

When Musa al-Sadr, the venerated leader of Lebanon's Shiites, failed to return from a visit with Moammar Gadhafi in Libya, his followers were distraught. While some clung to the hope that the charismatic figure was a ""hidden imam"" who would one day return - similar to their ninth-century Mahdi - most believed it was foul play. Suspicion fell on many, but it was the Iranian Shia leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then in exile, who had the greatest motive. The two imams strongly disagreed on whether Islam should govern a country and there was speculation that the Iranian-born al-Sadr, still popular in his birthplace, might confound the radical Khomeini plans that would soon unfold. Perversely, the Lebanese loss of their beloved imam radicalized a generation of young Shiites who would create the militant Hezbollah movement, one of Iran's greatest affiliates.

Viewers were invested in the story of Dr. Richard Kimble, played by a dour David Janssen, who was unjustly convicted of murdering his wife. After escaping custody in the pilot, Kimble spent four seasons, from 1963 to 1967, chasing the real killer - the enigmatic one-armed man - with dogged Lieutenant Gerard (played by CBC fixture Barry Morse) in hot pursuit. In the closer, Kimble finally caught his nemesis and was exonerated. All told, the finale was viewed in nearly 26 million U.S. households by more than 78 million people, making it the most-watched program up to that point.

With the United States mired in an increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam and rent by conflict at home, a deeply divided Democratic Party gathered to pick its 1968 presidential nominee. President Lyndon Johnson, fed up with factions seeking to oust him, wasn't running. Robert Kennedy, younger brother of the slain former president, sought the anti-war vote in his bid for the nomination before he too was assassinated, leaving the party in even greater disarray. With 100 cities still smouldering from riots following the killing of Martin Luther King Jr., the gathering became the next focal point for massive protests. Heavily armed police viciously beat thousands of demonstrators. ""The whole world is watching,"" they chanted, along with ""Hell no, we won't go"" and ""Pigs are whores."" A shattered party eventually picked Hubert Humphrey, who was easily beaten by Republican Richard Nixon.

Maybe never before or since has an election been lost in 30 seconds. Having just won the Liberal leadership, John Turner called a snap election. But the former finance minister was rusty after a political hiatus, voters were tired of Liberal government, and Turner earned no end of hurt when cameras caught him patting Liberal Party president Iona Campagnolo's bum. (She patted him back.) The real turning point came during the debate, when Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney attacked Turner for acquiescing to a host of patronage appointments foisted on him by outgoing prime minister Pierre Trudeau. ""I had no option,"" Turner replied. ""You had an option, sir,"" Mulroney shot back. ""You could have said, 'I am not going to do it.' "" Election over. Voters elected a huge Tory majority; the Liberals were reduced to 40 seats. Turner never really recovered.

In the first day of his capture of Stockholm's Sveriges Kreditbank, escaped convict Jan-Erik Olsson had many of his demands met: three million kronor, two pistols and his comrade Clark Olofsson freed from prison to join him. But the bank robbers got something unexpected, too. Over a six day siege while they negotiated a getaway plan, their four hostages bonded with them, seeing small kindnesses as mercy and believing that police were the real threat. When police finally flushed out their bank-vault hiding spot with tear gas, the hostages shielded the robbers by letting them come out first, against police orders. To psychologists and the public, the bankdramat (bank drama) - which gave ""Stockholm syndrome"" its name - was a cautionary tale of what captives may do to endure the stress of captivity.

Abe's appearance followed a glossy promotional video showing athletes in stereotypical scenes from Tokyo, as well as various characters from popular culture, including Hello Kitty and Doraemon. The scene cut to Abe in a taxi, fretting that he wouldn't make it to Rio on time, followed by an animated Super Mario diving into a green pipe in Tokyo, emerging as a human figure from the green pipe on the field in Rio de Janeiro. When his costume fell off, the prime minister emerged, holding a red ball and waving a red cap, a shadow of a smile on his face.

Unfortunately, that was the only anatomically correct part of her effort. The mouth she painted was a child's smear, the eyes those of a cartoon monkey. The nose was barely distinguishable from the flat surface of the face. The botched restoration earned Gimenez viral infamy. The church thought it was an act of vandalism before the truth came out.
Yet even press about being a clueless hack with a brush is good press: The attention helped boost tourism tenfold and raised money for the church, which began charging visitors to see the artwork. The shaming crowd loves a good selfie, after all.

The England-Argentina quarter-final match of the 1986 World Cup was bound to be fraught with emotion, coming just four years after the Falklands War. The first goal was scored by Argentina's cocksure superstar, Diego Maradona. While jumping as if to head a ball in front of the net, he swept an arm up and banged it in. The referee missed it. The goal was allowed to stand, and later Maradona would cheekily credit it to ""the hand of God.""
Just four minutes later, he made a spectacular 55-metre dash past four England players, faked out the goal keeper and dispatched the ball into the net. It clinched Argentina's victory, and the team went on to claim the Cup. In 2002, that second goal was voted World Cup Goal of the Century.

June 20, 1840 - American Samuel Morse was a sought-after portrait painter in the early 1800s, but he is remembered for creating an eponymous system of dots and dashes used to communicate over great distances. Morse code could be transmitted by telegraph and, later, light signals and sounds. With the exception of some navies and amateur radio buffs, its use is limited today. At the time of its introduction, however, it was revolutionary. Morse,

The prospect wasn't even really on his radar, then; nothing much was, because he was so burnt out after the federal Conservatives' election loss. 

Publicly, he is now saying that he will decide by summer's end whether to seek the federal leadership or try to forge a ""united alternative"" to Alberta's governing NDP (or do neither). 

Privately, according to several sources close to him, he is leaning toward the provincial option, and may move quicker than he has let on.

Alfred Hitchcock had spooked audiences with his psychological thrillers Rear Window and Vertigo, but what Paramount wanted was another star-studded adventure like North by Northwest. The studio declined to underwrite a horror film based on the Robert Bloch novel Psycho, forcing the director to shoot in black and white with a TV crew while dodging censors to show Janet Leigh in a bra during a lunchtime tryst. Critics were divided when the low-budget movie opened in New York, but audiences immediately responded to a level of sex and violence never seen in mainstream American cinema.
Latecomers weren't permitted lest they missed Leigh, whose dubious heroine was famously stabbed in the shower before the halfway mark by Anthony Perkins as superbly creepy Norman Bates. Psycho proved Hitchcock's biggest hit, and critics soon agreed this was the most artful horror movie ever.

It was a quickie wedding - but for Michael Leshner and Michael Stark it was decades in the making. The Michaels, as they were dubbed, had been together for more than 20 years - and became the first same-sex couple in Canada to legally marry. Their civil ceremony took place just hours after Ontario's Court of Appeal ruled that Canada's marriage law was unconstitutional. It was a joyous day - a triumph for equality as Ontario became the first jurisdiction in North America to acknowledge same-sex marriage. In 2005, Ottawa passed legislation legalizing it across the country. However, in 2006, the Conservatives came to power promising a free vote to revisit the issue. It failed. Last month, the federal Tories voted at their convention to erase the traditional definition of marriage from their policies.

What further action can Ottawa take?

It was a national call to prayer, and for 39 seasons its brassand-bass fanfare prompted a Pavlovian pricking up of Canadians' ears as they tuned in to CBC's Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts. But after years of feeling ill-treated by the public broadcaster for various perceived sins (lack of onscreen credit, tussles over ancillary rights to such uses as ring tones), composer Dolores Claman rejected CBC's contract offer and sold her baby for a reported $2.5-million to CTV for use in its TSN hockey broadcasts. Canadians of a certain age took it hard, decrying the cold calculations of capitalism. The symbolism may have hurt more than the loss itself: If a nation's unofficial anthem was in fact private property that could be bought and sold like so much chattel, what did that mean for the nation itself?

The political journey of actor and activist Charlton Heston ranged from civil rights advocacy to challenging political correctness as ""tyranny with manners."" He became the most outspoken and controversial champion of the Second Amendment on his election as president of the National Rifle Association. At the 2000 NRA convention, Heston famously raised aloft an old flintlock rifle and warned that Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore would ""slander you as gun-toting, knuckle-dragging, bloodthirsty maniacs."" He would attempt to take away your guns, Heston warned before delivering what has become his most enduring line, a variation on an old gun-rights slogan: ""Mr. Gore: From my cold, dead hands!"" Gore narrowly lost to George W. Bush, and Heston announced in 2002 that he had Alzheimer's disease. He died in 2008, but the United States remains deeply divided over gun rights.

It was a very American invention. ""Sit in your car,"" invited the original tagline. ""See and hear movies."" Beckoned by such a harmony of Hollywood and Detroit, who could say no? The answer, by the middle of the century, was hardly anyone. The first iteration in Camden, N.J., came with tinny sound and laboured to turn a profit, but drive-in movie theatres spread wildly across the United States in the next three decades, peaking at about 5,000 by the mid-1960s. The reasons for that popularity are a digest of postwar American culture: the proliferation of kids (who could be noisy at the drive-in); the rise of teen culture (where better to neck?); the adoration of the automobile; and, in the country that gave us the shopping cart and the washing machine, a lust for consumerist convenience.

Instead, McSorley was penalized and Demers pulled goalie Patrick Roy for a two-man advantage.

Officially, the race was to determine the ""World's Fastest Human."" Unofficially, it was a 150-metre dash to settle a clash of the biggest egos in track and field that had smouldered since the previous summer's Olympics. Despite a world-record 100-metre run, Donovan Bailey, from Oakville, Ont., had been overshadowed by American golden boy Michael Johnson's record-setting sprints. NBC sportscaster Bob Costas added fuel to the fire by anointing Johnson the fastest man on the planet after dividing his 200-metre time in half, with the resulting 9.66 bettering Bailey's 9.84-second mark. Bailey had the final say on home soil, however, overcoming concerns about the tight curve of the SkyDome's track to lead Johnson coming into the home straight, at which point Johnson turned into ""a chicken,"" according to Bailey, reaching for his left thigh and pulling up lame.

Trivia buffs know that Big Ben is the name of the bell, not the clock, that towers over the British Houses of Parliament. But Ben and his companions wouldn't know when to chime without the methodical precision of the Great Clock, which for 150 years has faithfully kept time for Londoners.
In hot weather and cold, the 15-foot pendulum sways back and forth and the hands move steadily around the four faces. The time is regulated with predecimal pennies: Adding one causes the clock to gain two-fifths of a second over 24 hours. The bells will fall silent early next year while the clock and tower undergo maintenance and repairs - but anyone wishing to hear the familiar melody in the meantime can download the ringtone from the Big Ben page on the parliamentary website.

Before he dropped the ball, Robert Stanfield had thrice been premier of Nova Scotia; led the Progressive Conservatives to within two seats of the Trudeaumania-steeped Liberals; and entered the 1974 campaign following a no-confidence vote that defeated Trudeau's government.
During a break on the campaign trail in North Bay, Ont., Stanfield threw perfect spirals and frequently caught that football. But it was the photo of him clumsily missing a catch - snapped by Canadian Press photographer Doug Ball - that made the front page of this newspaper. It's trite to say a single image lost him the election. But it didn't help. And that fumble presaged the growing influence of political image crafting. It's fitting that the man who beat Stanfield in that election also fathered a prime minister who, in today's world of social media, is a master of the photo op.

Inside the country, rhetoric has become personal and extreme over an exit some argue threatens to stifle trade and put the nation's economy into recession. Outside, the very notion of a united Europe is under severe strain. Whatever voters decide, it's a union that may already be too fractured to save.

The question posed to Quebeckers in 1980 was almost as long as this vignette but could be boiled down to this: Should Quebec begin negotiations toward greater autonomy from Canada? That may sound reasonable, but the objective behind the question was Quebec independence and the breakup of Canada. The answer on referendum night was a resounding ""No."" Most Quebeckers saw safety in a strong Quebec remaining in a united Canada. In his concession speech, Parti Québécois Premier René Lévesque prophetically mused, ""My dear friends, if I understand you correctly, you're saying, 'Until next time.' "" Quebec would spend the next 15 years seeking special constitutional status. Rejected, the province would come within a percentage point of a Yes vote in 1995. With no major flashpoint since, the movement has faded - now a distant dream held by about a third of Quebeckers.

In the traditionally male world of the Canadian military, Captain Nichola Goddard believed that gender shouldn't matter. When a training sergeant referred to a light backpack as a ""girlie"" bag, she told him to change the term. When a commander ordered tarps to separate the male and female sections of their tents in Afghanistan, she objected fiercely.
And when Canadian troops were ambushed by dozens of Taliban militants near Kandahar, she fought fearlessly in the counterattack, becoming the first Canadian army officer to direct artillery fire at an enemy force since Korea.
As the crew commander, she was standing half-exposed in her armoured vehicle when it was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades. She became the first female Canadian soldier to be killed in combat. But she wouldn't have wanted the obituaries, either, to dwell on her gender.

It was one funky step for Michael Jackson, one giant leap for pop culture. During a performance of his hit single Billie Jean on the TV special Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, the sequined superstar dazzled his audience with a popping dance routine that included a gliding manoeuvre and optical illusion - moving backward while appearing to walk forward.
Known as the moonwalk, the origin of the fancy piece of footwork was traceable to Cab Calloway, who, in the 1930s, used to do something similar that he called ""the buzz."" After the mono-gloved Jackson showcased the step, the moonwalk became his signature move and trendy worldwide - the snazzy slide seemingly something out of this world.

The man who would become the greatest magician in history was born Ehrich Weiss, the son of a rabbi. After immigrating to the United States as a boy, he seized on magic as his escape from poverty. At 17, he renamed himself after his idol, French magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin. Houdini dabbled in card tricks, billing himself as ""The King of Cards"" in performances at sideshows. At 22, having failed to find much success, he took out a newspaper ad offering to sell his magic and secrets for $20. No one responded. With that moment of doubt behind him, Houdini's determination never wavered. For proof, look no further than the words he would add to his autographs for adoring fans. ""My brain is the key that sets me free.""

The Iditarod Trail was originally used to carry mail and supplies to remote Alaskan communities, most famously in 1925 when a sled-dog relay was used to rush diphtheria medication to Nome during an outbreak. Inspired by that historic journey, the first edition of the 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometre) sled-dog trek through the wilderness from Anchorage to Nome saw Dick Wilmarth win $12,000 (U.S.) with his first-place time of 20 days 49 minutes 41 seconds on a route that included stretches with no trail.
That's a far cry from the multiple check points, GPS and groomed paths in use today. Even so, the experience is a gruelling one; many do not complete the race. Those who do become local heroes, such as 2016 champion Dallas Seavey, who crossed the finish line in a record-breaking time of 8 days 11 hours 20 minutes 16 seconds.

Spinning off the success of the breakout single Please Please Me, the inevitable LP was recorded at EMI Studios in 10 hours, for which John, George, Paul and Ringo were each paid the princely sum of roughly £20. At 14 tracks, the song list was split between pop standards (Chains, Baby It's You) and Lennon-McCartney originals (Love Me Do, Ask Me Why). Producer George Martin wanted the cover to be photographed at the London Zoo, but the Zoological Society of London scotched the idea, so they posed in an EMI stairwell. Released in mono, followed by a stereo version four weeks later, Please Please Me held the top spot on the British music charts for 30 straight weeks, until it was replaced by the group's second album, With the Beatles.

The man who was prime minister for nearly 10 years and wanted to make it 14, the polarizing political mastermind who reinvented partisanship and confidently subjected his citizens to the longest, bitterest election in Canadian history, which was his to win and which he then shockingly lost, has virtually vanished.

The House of Commons doesn't publish attendance records. But in the five months since the election, Harper has introduced no bills, has made no interventions in the House or in committee. He hasn't taken the floor once. 

Here's the strange thing: Whatever your political stripe, however much he was your hero or your enemy, do you not somewhere, if only in the remotest corner of your political subconscious, want to know where he is and how he's doing, and whether defeat and distance have cracked the kiln-fired veneer of the most emotionally reserved prime minister in living memory? He ran the whole show, and now he has vanished, like Waldo.

While some parades in the 1800s were extremely nationalistic (Toronto's was occasionally cancelled due to passions and loutishness), processions in Montreal ""were quiet and respectable affairs that brought together the Irish elite and reflected the cordiality that existed between Protestants and Catholics,"" according to academic Rosalyn Trigger. Today, the parade is one of the biggest parties of the year in Montreal (almost 40 per cent of francophone Quebeckers have some Irish roots), but it has fallen on hard times. Amid rising costs and waning sponsorship, organizers are asking for donations. The parade survived 192 years, through the Rebellions of 1837, Fenian raids, the assassination of Thomas D'Arcy McGee and two world wars. It seems likely to survive this, too.

The first Football Association Cup final was played between the Wanderers and Royal Engineers. The English didn't invent the game, but with the creation of the FA Cup, they gave it its eternal, meritocratic flavour.
Only 20 teams compete in the country's top division. But each year, every outfit in the lower divisions is given a chance to play for the sport's oldest cup.
It amounts to more than 700 teams in all. As a rule, the big clubs win it in the end. But every once in a while, a team from the back of beyond will go on a dream run through the competition. Those names are etched in English soccer history: Wrexham, Sutton, Colchester, Hereford United. All it takes is one great day to create a historic moment. More than watching the best play, that is the magic of the FA Cup.

Mikhail Gorbachev looked like change from the moment he was sworn in. Unlike his two immediate predecessors - septuagenarians who died just 13 months apart - Gorbachev was a relatively young 54 when he became General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was the first leader of the USSR to have been born after the 1917 revolution. Still, no one could have foreseen what Gorbachev's six years in the top post would bring: glasnost, perestroika, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War. While still hailed as a hero in the West, Gorbachev is not as well regarded at home. Many Russians blame him for the collapse of living standards they experienced in the 1990s - and for letting Russia's empire slide away.

In an intense and often divisive era of constitutional reform, Joe Clark looked to the past for a unifying symbol. In 1885, the Métis leader Louis Riel was executed for treason after leading the disastrous North-West Rebellion. But through the passage of time, as well as the political needs of the moment, the rebel could now be transformed into a nation-builder - a charismatic Westerner and francophone who rallied the disenfranchised peoples of the Red River settlement toward self-government, creating the conditions for Manitoba to join Confederation in 1870. The former prime minister's resolution, adopted unanimously, acclaimed Riel ""for his unique and historic role as a founder of Manitoba"" - but stopped short of calling him a Father of Confederation or granting him the posthumous pardon appropriate to his new-found status.

After two decades spent clawing its way in, hip hop was flourishing in music's mainstream, but it was marred by tragedy. California's Tupac Shakur died the previous year following a drive-by shooting, and, in the early morning of March 9, rap lost another figurehead. Shakur's friend-turned-rival Christopher Wallace, the Brooklyn rapper better known as the Notorious B.I.G., was gunned down at a red light outside a Los Angeles party. He was only 24. Investigators, media and the public spent years scouring for any juicy detail they could find to link the two murders to the East Coast-West Coast ""rivalry"" that coincided with Shakur and Wallace's falling out. Both cases, however, remain unsolved. Wallace's sophomore album, Life After Death, was released two weeks after his killing, and his legacy has fulfilled that title's prophecy: He remains one of the most influential rappers of all time.

It was one of the ugliest incidents in recent NHL history. Todd Bertuzzi, then one of the Vancouver Canucks' biggest stars, sucker-punched Colorado Avalanche rookie Steve Moore in the head late in an 8-2 game in Vancouver. Exacting revenge for a legal hit to the head that Moore had put on Canucks captain Markus Naslund a month earlier, Bertuzzi knocked Moore unconscious before a pile of players landed on top of them. Moore suffered three fractured vertebrae and a serious concussion and had to be taken off the ice on a stretcher. He spent months in a Denver hospital. After a tearful televised apology, Bertuzzi was suspended for the remainder of the season - 20 games and more than $500,000 (U.S.) in salary - and was never the same player again. Moore was never able to return to the NHL. They settled a civil lawsuit for an undisclosed amount in 2014.

But for reasons that touched off years of legal battles, the Scottish teacher was the first to be granted a patent for the telephone. The device, which sprung from his studies of sounds and vibrations, was invented at his Boston lab and his family home in Brantford, Ont. He described it in his patent application as a ""method of, and apparatus for, transmitting two or more telegraphic signals along a single wire."" In an adorable bit of old-timey understatement, he also said it featured ""new and useful improvements in telegraphy."" He was granted U.S. patent No. 174,465 and would grow wealthy from his invention, which became quite popular.

Pierre Trudeau seemed every inch the happy bachelor in the late winter of 1971. Canada's 15th Prime Minister, 51 at the time, had squired many an attractive female since his 1968 election, including Barbra Streisand and the daughter of a former Liberal cabinet minister, Margaret Sinclair. But he seemed in no rush for the altar. Then one Thursday evening, news broke that Trudeau had married Sinclair, nearly 29 years his junior, in a small, secret ceremony at a North Vancouver church. Even the presiding Catholic priest hadn't known the groom's name in advance. The couple had first met in 1968, became engaged in fall, 1970, and, had the October Crisis not intervened, planned to marry that December. Canadians showered the newlyweds with good wishes and for a while the unlikely union of worldly politico and selfdescribed ""hippie"" seemed to work. Six years and three children later, though, the two announced their separation.

Anne Sullivan relished challenging convention. Partially blind, the daughter of Irish immigrants was sent to an overcrowded, dilapidated home for the poor at the age of 10 after her mother died and her father abandoned the family. She might have remained in squalor had she not summoned up the moxie to tell a group of visiting officials that she wanted to go to school. She started far behind her peers but was, as the school director dubbed her, a spitfire. She persevered and went on to become valedictorian. That pluck and cleverness served her well for her next challenge: becoming governess to a wild and stubborn child, Helen Keller, who was blind, deaf and mute. Sullivan unlocked Keller's silent world, teaching her the meaning of words, how to multiply and how to read Braille. She was by her side always, guiding her pupil and friend to become the first deaf-blind person to graduate from an American college.

By the end of 2016, they will also have to allow viewers to pick-and-pay for individual channels. 

Virtually everyone in the TV business agrees on what that future will look like: Jobs will be lost, some channels will die and some viewers will trim their spending.

Feb. 26, 1919 - With the Grand Canyon's status as an icon of Americana, it's hard to believe its future was once threatened. For almost 30 years a political battle raged between conservationists (including Theodore Roosevelt, who once proclaimed the site ""fills me with awe"") and their foes – various commercial interests, including miners, who wondered whether a few well-placed sticks of dynamite might just uncover thick veins of gold. Even Roosevelt at the height of his presidential powers was unable to push a bill through Congress to preserve the canyon. It was only in 1919 that U.S. President Woodrow
Wilson assembled enough votes to succeed in declaring the site a national park, thereby outlawing private development, including mines. In the ensuing decades, the baby boom, coupled with the rise of the automobile, made the Grand Canyon a destination for countless family road trips and cemented its place in the American psyche. Today, the natural wonder receives more than five million visitors every year. – Ken Carriere",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153911939508904/?type=3,2016-02-26 10:34:10,157,7,30,148,8,0,1,0,0

Feb. 25, 1723: Born the son of a rector in Wiltshire, Christopher Michael Wren dabbled in astronomy and mathematics before committing to architecture in his 30s. Wren essayed his unique design on several buildings, but his finest hour came in the wake of the Great Fire of London in 1666, which reduced two-thirds of the city to smoking rubble and required rebuilding on a massive scale. Wren's initial design for St Paul's Cathedral was rejected – bringing him to tears – but he came back with a toned-down version of the great dome. All
told, Wren designed 53 churches and dozens of other London landmarks. Wren took frequent trips into the city and on one such visit he caught the chill that claimed his life at 91.

In consort with photogenic pop partner Fabrice Morvan, Pilatus was coming off a debut album that sold 14 million units and produced five charttopping hits - but a bumbled live MTV appearance had already sparked rumours the dreadlocked duo might be poseurs. The truth came out in November when German record producer Frank Farian admitted to recruiting Pilatus and Morvan to front for songs he had created using studio musicians. Four days later, Milli Vanilli were stripped of their Grammy and promptly plunked into pop-star ignominy. Sadly, the next time Milli Vanilli made headlines was in 1998 when Pilatus was found dead of an apparent drug overdose in a Frankfurt hotel room.

The Fab Four were still a magical mystery on this side of the Atlantic when they scored a No. 1 Billboard hit with I Want to Hold Your Hand in early 1964. That changed in early February when John, Paul, George and Ringo landed at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, greeted by legions of rapturous fans. Two days later, the Beatles made history. Appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show, their U.S. television debut exhilarated fans here, there and everywhere. You could hear the studio audience screaming as the band ran through early hits such as All My Loving and She Loves You, but the excitement wasn't contained to the Manhattan theatre: A reported 73 million people watched the broadcast - 60 per cent of all televisions turned on in the United States - cementing the Beatles as the biggest band in the world.

The plane was set to deliver supplies to Managua, Nicaragua, where a deadly earthquake had struck a week earlier.
The 38-year-old baseball great had been a big part of Puerto Rico's aid efforts, helping to raise $150,000. He even chartered the flight after suspicions arose that supplies weren't reaching victims. There is dispute over the cause of the crash, but the plane was allegedly 1,900 kilograms overloaded and had a history of mechanical troubles. Everyone aboard died and Clemente's body was never found. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on March 30, 1973 - only fitting for a player who won four National League batting titles, 12 Gold Gloves and two MVP awards.

Godwin soon found herself pregnant (she lost the baby when it was born two months premature) and cut off from her father, but the relationship continued. In the summer of 1816, the lovebirds spent part of the summer visiting Lord Byron at his villa in Switzerland, telling each other ghost stories (one of which became Frankenstein, which Mary Shelley published anonymously in 1818). That fall, Shelley's wife, Harriet, herself pregnant (though the child was not Shelley's), threw herself into Hyde Park's Serpentine River. Shelley and Godwin were married 20 days later. The marriage, alas, was short-lived: He died in 1822 at the age of 29.

This occurred after Indonesian Captain Iriyanto, a former fighter pilot, left his seat to fiddle with circuit breakers in an unorthodox attempt to reset one of the aircraft's computers. Nose high, the steeply climbing jet lost so much speed that it ceased flying, rolled into a spiral dive and plummeted into the sea. Crash investigators, who have ceased using the term ""pilot error,"" concluded: ""Flight crew action resulted in inability to control the aircraft."" – Paul Koring (Photo: Darren Whiteside/Reuters)",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153781086738904/?type=3,2015-12-28 21:15:19,24,6,6,24,0,0,0,0,0

140961138903_10153770771093904,"Merry Christmas Canada! Here it is, our annual painting: Lake Superior III (circa 1923-24), by Lawren S. Harris (1885-1970). Lawren Harris's first visit to the north shore of Lake Superior, in the fall of 1921, was a revelation. Here at last were skies of ""singing expansiveness and sublimity,"" a stark landscape of ""mystery and bigness"" that seemed the purest complement to his deepest spiritual, nationalist and artistic yearnings. Not for Mr. Harris the ""opulent"" wilderness of Ontario's Algoma or Algonquin. His soul had been scoured by the deaths of his brother Howard and his painter friend Tom Thomson, as well as his own nervous breakdown in April, 1918 and an unsatisfying marriage. Seeking ""replenishment"" of his life and art, he found it in the ""cleansing rhythms"" and ""greater living quiet"" of the granitic Canadian Shield country. In all Mr. Harris would make eight trips to the north shore, always in autumn, producing such signature works as the panoramic Lake Superior III. An austere masterpiece of deep, illumined pictorial space, it's a suite of simplified, almost abstract forms crisply rendered with flattened brush strokes of blue and grey, burgundy, umber and amber. While Mr. Harris went on to render other latitudes, other altitudes, including the Rockies and the Arctic, his brilliant metaphysical mystery tour started here. And as this year ends, a year that for many has seemed especially dark, there's solace to be found in the enduring rocks, the wide, open horizon and the eternal persistence of the light coming in. – James Adams (Painting courtesy of the estate of Lawren S. Harris)",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153770771093904/?type=3,2015-12-25 07:30:00,1927,57,673,1927,0,0,0,0,0

Surely the year 1992 could not inflict any more pain: By late November, the Queen had suffered so much she referred to it as her ''annus horribilis.'' Over the previous 11 months she had endured the crumbling of three of her four children's marriages - including mortifying revelations about their affairs - a fire that devastated her beloved Windsor Castle and a rancorous debate over whether the Crown should pay income tax. Yet 1992 had one more insult left. On Dec. 23, the Sun printed a leaked transcript of the Queen's annual Christmas broadcast, blemishing a cherished tradition that dated back 60 years to her grandfather's voice on the radio. The leak, however, was widely seen as needlessly disrespectful, and so, ironically, 1992 would end with the Queen winning back a measure of public sympathy. - Ken Carriere",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153767417433904/?type=3,2015-12-23 07:15:02,74,7,13,74,0,0,0,0,0

And yet the benefit concert at Vienna's Theater an der Wien was a dream event that saw the premieres of Beethoven's Symphonies No. 5 and No. 6, and of the Piano Concerto No. 4, with the composer conducting from the keyboard. During the concerto, the wildly gesturing Beethoven knocked two candles off the piano, then accidentally smacked the face of one of the boys delegated to hold fresh candles. Another piece at the end of the show fell apart and had to be restarted. It was all a bit much, musically and every other way, but that hasn't stopped others from recreating this landmark concert - the last Beethoven ever gave.

The Justice Minister was defending legislation that, in its final form, decriminalized homosexuality, permitted abortion in certain circumstances, decriminalized contraception, introduced the 0.08 bloodalcohol concentration limit for drinking and driving, legalized lotteries, restricted the use of firearms and more. The same year Trudeau introduced the bill, the Supreme Court had upheld a dangerous-offender life sentence for a man convicted of homosexuality, and NDP Leader Tommy Douglas appeared enlightened when he declared in 1968: ""Instead of treating [homosexuality] as a crime and driving it underground, we ought to recognize it for what it is: It's a mental illness."" Despite an attempted filibuster from the Créditistes, Bill C-150 passed in May, 1969 - with Trudeau as Prime Minister at that point - forever shattering the power of religion to restrict the actions of government and bringing social tolerance to this land.

TV's most enduring festive chestnut came into existence through a perfect creative trifecta: Theodor Geisel's guileless 1957 book served as source material; veteran animator Chuck Jones, best known for Bugs Bunny, essayed the crisp visuals converting the story into a 26-minute cartoon; and horror-film legend Boris Karloff - in one of his final roles - was both narrator and growly voice of the Grinch himself. CBS earned solid ratings for the inaugural broadcast and likewise for the next two decades, after which the special resurfaced annually on NBC, TNT, TBS and ABC. Over the years, the redemptive concept has been revisited in a handful of TV specials, including the Emmy-winning Halloween Is Grinch Night, but none captured the charm of the original - and the less said about the 2000 film starring Jim Carrey, the better.

The Communist bulwark of the Caribbean had lost its patron state, Venezuela, and President Raul Castro needed a wealthy new friend to help replenish his country's empty coffers. U.S. President Barack Obama's own economy was on the rebound, but his cupboard of foreign-policy victories was looking bare. So after behind-the-curtains diplomacy led by Pope Francis and the office of U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, the so-called Cuban Thaw commenced. Hoping to repair the damage wrought by a century of mutual suspicion, military misadventure and the unlawful nationalization of U.S. property, the two leaders announced a normalizing of relations. While obstacles remain in lifting the United States' economic blockade - el bloqueo - the next Yanqui invasion has already leapt over the crumbling seawalls of the Malecon. There is now Wi-Fi access, greater freedom of financial transactions and, most of all, travel. Unfathomable even a couple of years ago, the red, white and blue of American Airlines now touches down at Havana's airport.

Austen - once an anonymous author and now one of Britain's most celebrated writers - was born exactly 240 years ago, in 1775. Hollywood has turned her classic novels into box-office hits, although sometimes still on the stealth. Clueless, the 1995 flick starring Alicia Silverstone, riffs off Emma, as if no one would notice. Shades of Pride and Prejudice show up in Bridget Jones's Diary. Kandukondain Kandukondain is a Tamil version of Sense and Sensibility. Even Austen's unfinished work has fetched global attention. An unidentified buyer in 2011 paid $1.6-million (""U.S.) for a draft of The Watsons, which the author wrote in 1804. The manuscript sports edits in her handwriting. Austen wrote six books, two of which were published after she died in 1817.

Riding seven days a week for two months, he erased the previous record of 485 set 20 years earlier by famed U.S. rider Bill Shoemaker - a mark thought to be unbreakable. The 24-year-old Hawley would add 15 more wins by Dec. 31, but his total would be eclipsed the next year. Still, he left an indelible mark on the sport, winning so often at Hollywood Park in California that it was dubbed Hawleywood. Canadian fans were already familiar with his ability, often betting on his mounts regardless of their past performance. The future Hall of Fame athlete ended his career with 6,450 victories. His 20.5-per-cent winning percentage ranks sixth among riders with more than 4,000 victories.

It would be the world's largest hydroelectric dam, create a 600-kilometrelong reservoir, raise the waters of the Yangtze River by nearly 175 metres and hold it all back with 27.15 million cubic metres of cement that made 231,000 square metres of concrete wall - equivalent to 39 CFL fields. Construction began Dec. 14, 1994, but did not end until 2012, when it reached 22.5 gigawatts of electrical generating capacity, five times what exists on both sides of the Niagara River. China's ability to engineer and construct the monumental structure has inspired immense pride in its people, providing one of the markers of the country's ascension as a rising superpower. But in submerging 1,503 cities, towns and villages - and displacing more than a million people - it is also a defining symbol of the environmental and social destruction China has countenanced in the name of growth.

Lucas had been convicted of killing a drug trial witness and his wife; Turpin of killing a policeman in a gun battle. No matter that both trials were questionable and that Lucas protested his innocence right to the end. Outside the jail, as the executions took place, hundreds of picketers held a vigil, yelling ""murderers"" and ""killers"" at the authorities. A growing public distaste for capital punishment prevailed, but it took until 1967 for Parliament to vote that it should be limited to killers of police officers and prison guards. Only in 1976 was the death penalty abolished in Canada.

The identities of the winners were kept secret until the night of the ceremony. Germany's Wilhelm Roentgen, who discovered X-rays, and Emil von Behring, who developed a diphtheria serum, won in the physics and medicine categories. Dutch scientist Jacobus H. van 't Hoff took the chemistry prize for his foundational work in the field. The literature prize went to French poet Sully Prudhomme - to the surprise of those who were expecting Leo Tolstoy.

Born in Varennes, Que., in 1701, Marie-Marguerite Dufrost de La Jemmerais lost her father when she was seven, after which she took care of her four brothers and sisters. Her marriage to François d'Youville resulted in six children (four died in infancy) and his death in 1730 left her destitute. Soon after, the young widow funnelled her unwavering faith into founding the Sisters of Charity of Montreal, a.k.a. the Grey Nuns, which tended to the growing city's poor. Although Marie-Marguerite died in 1771, it took the Catholic Church nearly two centuries to recognize her. At her 1959 beatification, Pope John XXIII called her the ""Mother of Universal Charity."" The final honour came in 1990, when Pope John Paul II officially canonized her - the first native Canadian elevated to sainthood.

After working as an apprentice shopkeeper and briefly owning a bakery with his brothers, he opened a drygoods store in the small town of St. Marys. Following its success, he opened the first T. Eaton Co. in Toronto at 178 Yonge St., in 1869. It was less than 1,500 square feet and had a staff of just four, but it marked the beginning of an empire. The store was built on two principles: goods had one price - no haggling allowed - and honest dependability, captured in the long-standing slogan, ""Goods satisfactory or money refunded."" The business thrived, becoming one of the greatest retailers in Canada, making history with nearly every step.

An overconfident minority Conservative government, fresh off its second election win, refused to run deficits to counter a worsening recession - but did cut funding for political parties in its economic statement. Furious, Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion and NDP Leader Jack Layton, supported by the Bloc Québécois, agreed to defeat the Conservatives and form a coalition government. To stop them, Stephen Harper asked Governor-General Michaëlle Jean to prorogue Parliament for several weeks, to let tempers cool and allow the government to prepare a budget replete with a huge deficit. Jean kept the PM waiting for two hours to show her displeasure, but then agreed. It took seven years for the Liberals to finally bring the Conservatives down.

He lauded its ""giddy heights"" and ""picturesque steep streets."" He praised the ""frowning gateways"" through its stone fortifications and declared the town the Gibraltar of America.

The year was 1842. More than 140 years later, the descriptions still held. The heart of Quebec City survived fires, demolitions, tourist hordes and other vagaries of history to remain a timeless gem. It led UNESCO to put Old Quebec on its World Heritage List. The city founded by Champlain, capital of New France and then the new British colony, was the only surviving walled city north of Mexico and the continent's most ""complete fortified colonial town,"" the agency declared. Dickens could not have written a tale of one city any better.

The Grey Cup has a long tradition of weather-related drama, but one December weekend in Toronto 53 years ago has etched an enduring place in CFL lore. Exhibition Stadium's location on the shores of Lake Ontario often left it at the mercy of the elements, but when fog engulfed the Hamilton TigerCats and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers during the 50th Grey Cup, play became impossible. Winnipeg Tribune columnist Jack Matheson summed up the thoughts of those in attendance: ""I don't know if it was a good game or not, I didn't see it."" The referee agreed, and with Winnipeg leading 28-27 and 9 minutes 29 seconds remaining in the contest, he took the players off the field.
They returned the next day, but with no further scoring, the Blue Bombers secured their fourth championship in five years.

Imprisoned during the uprising, Tussaud avoided the guillotine by making the death masks of King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and other royalty, some of which were paraded as revolutionary trophies. Tussaud was eventually released from prison and began touring Britain to display her creations, which by then included Napoleon and some notorious serial killers.

Instead of a mundane meeting of World Trade Organization countries to launch a new round of trade talks, the protests and heavy-handed police response ignited furious street battles and a public debate over the merits and dangers of globalization. The protests, confrontations and outbreaks of violence attracted international media attention. Seattle police, in riot gear, unleashed tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters. More than 150 were arrested; all eventually were released without charge. Inside the besieged summit, talks broke down after a bitter deadlock among rich countries over farm subsidies. Outside, protesters danced in the streets at news of the failure.

At the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Nord in Amiens, France, surgeons Bernard Devauchelle, Benoît Lengelé and Jean-Michel Dubernard gingerly lifted a triangle of face tissue, including nose and mouth, from a brain-dead donor and grafted it onto 38-year-old Isabelle Dinoire, whose Labrador had mauled her face. The 15-hour surgery altered the patient's appearance - her original wide nose and thin lips replaced by a narrow nose and fuller mouth - but in 2007 Dinoire declared she was ""very satisfied"" with the outcome. The groundbreaking surgery led to further medical advances, most notably a 2010 procedure in which a team of 30 Spanish doctors performed the world's first full face transplant on a man injured in a shooting accident.

Or maybe he sensed a chance to earn a fast buck. What's clear is that when the Canadian Pacific Railway worker and two others stumbled upon a thermal spring in a misty cave on the slopes of Sulphur Mountain, they decided to cordon the area off to other visitors. In so doing, the trio created a crude boundary around what would later become Canada's first national park.

""Like some fantastic dream from a tale of the Arabian Nights"" is how McCardell characterized his ""discovery"" of the hot spring in the fall of 1883 - the waters were well known to First Nations and earlier inhabitants of the Bow Valley. By 1885, the Cave and Basin historical site was subsumed by Banff National Park, which remains a modern refuge for Calgarians and is Canada's most-visited national park.

There was life before Life. Life the magazine, that is. Today, if the magazine's remembered at all, it's for its most famous incarnation as a New York-based weekly packed with the world's best photojournalism, selling millions of copies. The original Life, founded in 1883, was an illustrationheavy, light-entertainment publication - until, that is, Time magazine founder Henry R. Luce bought it for $92,000 (U.S.). Life and only Life, Mr. Luce felt, could be the title for the mass-circulation, all-photograph weekly he was keen to launch. For the first cover story he assigned Margaret Bourke-White to travel to the Missouri River in Montana to photograph the construction of Fort Peck, then the world's largest earth-filled dam. An immediate hit, Life thrived as a weekly for the next 36 years, every cover emblazoned with that bold white-on-red LIFE logo. It limped on in various formats until 2007, when Time Inc. declared the print edition dead.

Facing a tribunal of judges from the victorious countries - Britain, France, the United States and Russia - they were accused of starting a war of aggression and horrendous atrocities, including organizing and carrying out the murder of millions. The verdicts came 10 months later, when a dozen of them, including Germany's former foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Luftwaffe leader Hermann Goering, were sentenced to death. Others got prison sentences, and a few were acquitted. Trials of dozens of lower-level Nazis continued for years afterward.

""A penalty is a cowardly way to score,"" the Brazilian said later. Perhaps. But he'd slotted so many of such exquisite quality, the odd, rough smear on the canvas only highlighted the overall beauty of the work. After retrieving the ball, Pele jogged around the pitch, kissing it and crying. Reporters asked for his thoughts. ""Now that everyone is listening,"" the 29-year-old said, ""help the children, help the helpless."" Looking on, the man on the wrong end of history was hanging in his net, bereft. ""I didn't want to be that goalkeeper,"" Edgardo Andrada said. The Argentine knew in that moment that his 20-year career had been reduced to a footnote in Pele's story.

An underwater earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.2, struck about 250 kilometres south of the island's Burin Peninsula. Over the next half-hour, three giant waves began hurtling toward shore at up to 140 kilometres an hour. This rare Atlantic tsunami would take 28 lives - most of them women and children - rip homes from their foundations, destroy wharves, boats and flakes, and sweep provisions and fish that were about to be sold into the sea. Because the telegraph line had been damaged in an earlier storm, people in the 40 affected communities were on their own. That is until three days later, when the SS Portia made its scheduled stop, with the ship's captain spying a large store drifting along the shore.

It was the first national referendum in Canada's history, though it served mostly to prove how divided the country was. More than 80 per cent of Quebec voters said no to prohibition, while almost 90 per cent of Nova Scotians called for it.

Herman Melville, 72, author of Moby Dick, died of a heart attack at home while in his iron-frame bed. His funeral was a small affair - at his residence, near the old Madison Square Garden. The New York Times death notice mistakenly referred to him as Henry. His first two critically acclaimed novels - inspired by his time on a whaling ship - were followed by commercial flops. Moby Dick, published in 1851, was savaged by reviewers - ""purposeless extravagance,"" and not worth its $1.50 price. He died a hermit and unknown. But a Canadian essayist and Dalhousie University professor saw a genius. In 1889, Archibald MacMechan wrote Melville lamenting that Moby Dick had not received ""due recognition.""

The son of a Scottish immigrant who settled in Toronto, James Henry Fleming had been fascinated by birds since his teens. By the turn of the 20th century, Fleming was a respected ornithologist. One Sunday in the fall of 1905, he noted in his diary: ""In the garden in the afternoon I caught a robin which I will release with a ring, Number 1."" He had attached a tiny aluminum band to one of the bird's legs and then released it, to track where it wintered. ""Notify The Auk. N.Y.,"" the band said, referring to the journal of the American Ornithologists' Union, of which Fleming was a member. It was the first time a bird had been banded in Canada, and one of the earliest banding attempts in North America. Since then, millions of birds have been banded in what is now a standard scientific tool to track migrations. - Tu Thanh Ha",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153559315138904/?type=3,2015-09-24 10:30:03,88,10,18,88,0,0,0,0,0

For most of naval history, it was risky to try to destroy an enemy vessel. A captain could ram it or send a flaming ship in its direction and hope for the best. It wasn't until the Hundred Years' War that artillery - offering the chance to punch a hole from a safe distance - was used at sea. It was in the Battle of Arnemuiden, near Bruges, when five grain-carrying English ships armed with a trio of cannons went up against 48 French vessels. The small armament of the English couldn't save the day, and all the prisoners were massacred, but the rules of engagement had changed. A seven-century naval arms race had begun. Ships wielded ever-more powerful guns manned by growing crews aboard bigger and stronger vessels. Not until the 20th century was the battleship supplanted by the aircraft carrier, launching warplanes instead of shells. - Oliver Moore",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153557334468904/?type=3,2015-09-23 09:01:37,55,3,17,55,0,0,0,0,0

No mention was made of the slaves held in the four border states whose support was critical for the Union forces. Naturally, the proclamation that made slavery - not the Union - the focus of the war that began more than a year earlier was ignored by the Confederacy, which did not give up the fight for independence and slave ownership for another three years.

Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! ... The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished."" When Ms. O'Hanlon was in hospital at the age of 80, just weeks before Christmas, thousands of letters of encouragement were delivered to the hospital for ""the Santa Claus girl."" She died months later and her obituary in The New York Times, in May, 1971, recounted how she came to pen her letter: The New York Sun was regarded in her family as the arbiter of disputes.

Before he blazed into our consciousness, setting his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, James Marshall Hendrix, born in Seattle on Nov. 27, 1942, and later to become better known as Jimi, would have to endure a childhood of deep poverty, dislocation and abuse. His first instrument was a broken ukulele he retrieved from the garbage when he was 15. Later that year, he found a cheap electric guitar, and with it in his hands, the self-taught musician would eventually become a guitarist without peer. By the mid-sixties, he would move to London, front the Jimi Hendrix Experience band and become the highest-paid rocker in the world. His heavily metalized rendition of the American national anthem at Woodstock would become arguably the most iconic moment of the festival. ""Feeling, sweet feeling drops from my finger, fingers,"" he sang in Manic Depression. Famous for hits such as Purple Haze, Hey Joe and The Wind Cries Mary, Hendrix had a wild but short-lived ride atop the music world. He died in a London flat on Sept. 18, 1970, after choking on his own vomit while intoxicated with barbiturates. - Gary Mason",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153546805913904/?type=3,2015-09-18 10:45:04,153,17,108,153,0,0,0,0,0

A dashing Prussian aristocrat, Manfred von Richthofen embodied the chivalric mystique of First World War aces. Known in England as the Red Baron for the colour of his triplanes, he executed his first air combat victory of an eventual 80 - the most of any pilot in the conflict - with characteristic cold-blooded élan. Flying an Albatros D.II - a poky little machine to modern eyes - the Baron closed in on a British fighter over the northern French town of Cambrai. He killed both its observer and pilot - then, to celebrate, ordered an engraved silver cup from a jeweller in Berlin. Ruthless though they could be, early dogfights were relatively courtly compared with what followed. It was, ironically, another von Richthofen -Manfred's cousin Wolfram - who wrenched aerial warfare into its full modern brutality. As an officer in the German Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39, Wolfram pioneered the bombing of cities to deplete civilian morale. Among his first targets: the small Basque city of Guernica. - Eric Andrew-Gee",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153544772293904/?type=3,2015-09-17 09:41:52,41,18,31,41,0,0,0,0,0

While jailed in Yerwada prison for his latest civil disobedience campaign, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi vowed to ""fast unto death"" or until the British stopped a new Indian constitution that would separate the electorate by caste. Gandhi, who was born into the wealthier Vaishya, or merchant, caste, predicted such a system would further segregate India's most underprivileged social class, known as ""untouchables"" because of the menial jobs their ancestors performed. His hunger strike ended after six days when the British agreed to an alternate proposal that did not divide the electorate. Though India's constitution makes it illegal to discriminate based on caste, the country is still grappling with social problems caused by the centuries-old hierarchy, especially outside its major cities. This summer, tens of thousands of members from a land-owning caste took to the streets in the state of Gujarat to protest the Indian government's affirmative-action quotas. They want the removal of a system that has reserved space for members of the lower castes in educational institutions and the public service since the country gained independence. - Mike Hager",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153542551073904/?type=3,2015-09-16 10:06:02,80,5,33,80,0,0,0,0,0

The four girls were at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., for a youth service when a bomb ripped through the building and killed them. Twenty-two others were injured. The bombing of the predominantly black church was carried out by white supremacists and intended to stop civil-rights advances in the thoroughly segregated city. The explosion occurred days after Birmingham was ordered by the courts to desegregate its schools and less than three weeks after Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The deaths would spark immense outrage and help galvanize the civil-rights movement, with the Civil Rights Act passed the following year. In 2013, the four girls were posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honour the U.S. Congress can award civilians.

Within a year, a million women were employed, double the number in 1939. Many took up jobs in war-related industries, including a third of the aerospace industry. Women with children could stay home, the government said, but the shortage of labour was so severe that officials opened dozens of nurseries for children from two to five years old, to encourage mothers to work too. Surveys at the time showed that most women had no interest in giving up their jobs after the war. And many didn't.

As a result, 20 black students entered schools in Birmingham, Tuskegee and Mobile on Sept. 10, 1963. The desegregation, which lagged that of other southern states, came amid protests and violence, and was followed by a bombing five days later that killed four black girls at a Birmingham church, another bloody reminder the civil-rights movement faced a long battle for equality. - Eric Atkins",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153527686258904/?type=3,2015-09-10 09:52:48,146,20,54,146,0,0,0,0,0

When readers in Canada and the United States opened their newspapers on Sept. 9, 1979, they met the Pattersons, a family rooted in a fictitious Ontario town. For Better or For Worse, the comic creation of Canadian Lynn Johnston, was born. The series, which was based on Johnston's family and progressed in real time, chronicled the lives of Elly, John, Michael, Elizabeth and April, who was born in 1991. Fans grew attached to the characters - for better or for worse: When Michael's friend came out as gay in 1993, conservative newspapers boycotted the strip; when the family dog died saving April from drowning in 1995, Johnston received hundreds of emotional letters. For Better or For Worse ended its original run in 2008, but not before appearing in more than 2,000 newspapers globally. A Pulitzer Prize nominee, Johnston was the first Canadian and first woman to win the National Cartoonists Society's most prestigious annual award. - Kathryn Blaze Baum",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153525596553904/?type=3,2015-09-09 10:10:41,389,37,117,389,0,0,0,0,0

So launched the construction of Olympic Stadium, on of the most renowned money pits in Canadian history - marred with labour problems, structural issues and a chronically malfunctioning retractable roof made of a bullet resistant material that proved no match for the city's weather. The most serious result of these follies appeared in 1991, when a combination of shoddy new renovations and shoddy old construction sent a 55-ton chunk of concrete crashing down into the exterior walkway. Nobody was hurt, but the accident forced the Expos baseball team to play their final 13 games on the road.

The hail broke windows, dented cars, downed trees and even crushed flocks of migrating birds with its weight. Motorists found themselves stranded on streets transformed into lakes. Homeowners filed 116,000 insurance claims, with property damage estimated at more than $300-million.

Pheidippides did not run 40 kilometres from Marathon to Athens, much less announce a victory over the Persians with his dying words. The truth is more impressive: The professional messenger made a 250-kilometre overnight run from Athens to Sparta, which included a hallucinated conversation with the god Pan in the high mountains, to seek urgent military aid against the barbarian invaders. The Spartans hesitated - they'd like to help, they said, but would be delayed by some religious obligations. Pheidippides immediately turned around and dashed home with the discouraging news. The original marathon of the 1896 Athens Olympics honoured the romanticized version and started near the battlefield.

Standing in the rain on Parliament Hill, gay and lesbian activists gathered for the first large-scale gay-rights demonstration in Canada. They read a list of 10 demands, including the right to serve in the military and ""all legal rights for homosexuals which currently exist for heterosexuals."" Two years earlier, amendments to the Criminal Code allowed sexual relationships between any two consenting adults older than 21, effectively decriminalizing homosexuality. But the activists argued that they had hardly achieved equality. It would be 25 years before sexual orientation was added to the Canadian Human Rights Act.

After Jeannette Corbière Lavell married a non-First Nations man and lost her Indian status, her on-reserve home and treaty benefits, she lost her case to the Supreme Court, too. In a 5-4 vote, the court ruled the Bill of Rights didn't apply to section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act, which said indigenous women who married non-indigenous men were no longer Indians. Under the act, men who married non-indigenous women remained Indians and their wives and children acquired status, too. The law was finally reversed in 1985 when Sandra Lovelace challenged it through the UN Human Rights Committee. The federal government passed Bill C-31, allowing indigenous women who married non-indigenous men to have their status restored.

At the start of the 1971-72 season, Bobby Orr was at the height of his power. He had already made history in professional hockey to become the NHL's highest-paid player in 1966. But he broke that record when he signed a five-year contract with the Boston Bruins, with a pay of $200,000 (U.S.) a year. That put the total value of the contract at $1-million, the first-ever in NHL history. His agent, Alan Eagleson, was key in the negotiations. But Orr never got to see much of the money. In his biography, Orr says Eagleson tightly controlled his life and mismanaged his finances to the point where Orr had to declare bankruptcy.

But during an August night, somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide were suddenly released. The gas rose at nearly 100 kilometres an hour and sped into the valley, pushing away all the air. Once it reached the villages, nearly every living being caught in the eruption suffocated and died. The death toll was estimated at more than 1,700. Of those, 1,200 were in the village of Nios, where four people survived.

Barrymore! Pickford! Fairbanks! Every big star of 1925 Hollywood turned up at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre for Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush - as did more than 15,000 fans. The silent comedy was written, produced and directed by Chaplin, who naturally reprised his Little Tramp persona to play a luckless everyman trying to survive the Yukon gold rush. Conspicuously absent from the premiere was Chaplin's wife, teenaged actress Lita Grey, who was originally supposed to co-star in the film. Five days later, an announcement went out that Grey had given birth to Charlie Chaplin Jr. As it turned out, Charlie Jr. had been born several weeks before, but since his parents had only been married six months, Charlie Sr. paid a doctor to falsify the birth certificate. Scandal averted, The Gold Rush went on to become the highest-grossing silent comedy in cinema history. - Andrew Ryan",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153350364373904/?type=3,2015-06-26 07:59:42,82,2,29,82,0,0,0,0,0

On the day she became the country's first female prime minister, Kim Campbell wanted to project an image of austerity. The Canadian economy was sputtering, and if more than 11 per cent of the labour force was unemployed, she would put some ministers out of work, too. Only 24 were appointed, one of the smallest cabinets Ottawa had seen in decades, and government departments were combined, restructured or eliminated. The theme continued to her swearing-in at Rideau Hall. Politicians took taxis, not limos, and deputy prime minister Jean Charest and his family arrived on foot. Inexpensive wine was served. At Campbell's first Parliament Hill social function, guests were even charged a $5 cover.

The Soviet move to close all road and railway access to the German capital touched off fears of a new battle in a continent still shattered by the Second World War. Moscow's action was a bid to persuade the United States, Britain and France to withdraw from Berlin. But the Allies saw the city as a valuable outpost in Eastern Europe and a rampart against communism in an increasingly chilly Cold War. They briefly considered a military response to ensure Berliners had access to food and water. Instead, they launched a massive airlift, supplying goods to the city by plane - and delivering more than two million tonnes by the time the Soviets relented and ended the failed blockade almost a year later. - Eric Atkins",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153345321553904/?type=3,2015-06-24 07:33:23,83,15,36,83,0,0,0,0,0

They drugged her, drove her across the border and held her in a shack until she escaped five weeks later. To this day, this episode in the life of one of the most influential preachers of the 20th century hasn't been fully explained. Did she fabricate her kidnapping and run away with a radio sound engineer who disappeared at the same time? The scandal did not diminish her popularity. McPherson attracted thousands of followers to her white-domed church in Los Angeles and her radio broadcasts, paving the way for modern televangelists.

The famously toxic waterway winding through northeast Ohio had caught fire on at least a dozen previous occasions, the first time in 1868 and including a 1952 whopper that caused more than $1-million in damages. But the 1969 fire - a minor mid-river blaze of oil-soaked debris doused by firefighter tugboats - made the cover of Time magazine (though the cover shot was from the 1952 fire). Besides providing a dark counterpoint for the nascent environmental movement, the fire inspired Randy Newman to pen the acidic ditty Burn On. More important, the incident forced the U.S. government to address water pollution, which in turn resulted in the Clean Water Act and the creation of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

Bridges are meant to span the waves, not move like them.

When the Millennium pedestrian bridge spanning the River Thames in central London opened - overbudget and behind schedule - it swayed so dizzyingly that people crossing it joked that they needed seasickness pills. A victim of its own popularity, the Norman Foster-designed bridge welcomed an unexpectedly huge crowd of 160,000 on its opening weekend. As the bridge swayed, pedestrians changed their gait to steady themselves, and began to move in lockstep. This only increased the wobble, as the engineering firm Arup discovered.

The King kept his cool. When a gun went off in Hyde Park and wounded a man a few steps away, George III calmly offered his assistance. Later that day, the unflappable monarch took in a comedy at the Theatre Royal. As the national anthem played, a disturbed war veteran named James Hadfield fired his pistol at the royal box, convinced he could hasten the Second Coming of Christ by being killed in an act of regicide. When he missed, he offered friendly words to the unfazed sovereign - and the play went on. Hadfield was acquitted of treason due to insanity and should have been freed. But the prospect of an assassin on the loose was so worrying that new legislation was drafted, allowing insane offenders to be detained indefinitely ''at His Majesty's pleasure.''",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153232852558904/?type=3,2015-05-15 08:20:32,37,4,11,37,0,0,0,0,0

By current standards, it was a relatively small ''omnibus bill,'' but the impact of the Criminal Law Amendment Act on basic human freedoms was immense. Not everyone agreed with Pierre Trudeau's assertion that ''there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.'' Opposition to the legislation he introduced in 1967 was fierce. Its least controversial sections imposed new gun controls, regulated lotteries and made it an offence to drive while drunk. But it also made it legal for a woman to use contraception and to obtain an abortion if doctors said her health was at stake. And it decriminalized homosexual acts between consenting Canadians over the age of 21.

It only took three words to launch a revolution: ''little blue pill.'' The first oral medicine for impotence, Viagra was a failed heart-disease drug whose male trial patients had reported an unusual side effect: erections. Drug company Pfizer introduced the world to the phrase ''erectile dysfunction'' through a marketing campaign unprecedented in scale, and demand was sky-high. Despite the cost - as much as $10 (U.S.) for each pill - $78-million worth of the drug was prescribed in its first 48 hours on the market. Within two months, doctors had made out one million prescriptions; one Edmonton urologist described it as ''mass hysteria.'' Pfizer's share price soared by almost 40 per cent in the six weeks after the launch. Demand sagged somewhat after the initial surge, but Viagra remains a case study for success in the pharmaceutical industry. -- Kate Hopwood

But he was still alive, which was more than the retired Seattle dentist expected when, in the hopes of advancing medical research, he agreed to become the first human recipient of a permanent artificial heart. The Jarvik 7 was a total heart replacement made of two polyurethane pumps implanted in the chest and connected by tubes to an air compressor the size of a dishwasher. It kept Clark, 62, alive for 112 days, long enough for a fierce public debate about whether the scientific knowledge that might be gained was worth letting him suffer.

It only took them 20 days to travel around the world, not 80, but then Phileas Fogg didn't have the benefit of a $2-million hot-air balloon, a dozen ground crew and state-of-the-art weather-forecasting technology. When Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones crossed a finish line some 36,000 feet above Mauritania in the Breitling Orbiter 3, they became the first to complete a non-stop balloon trip around the globe - besting rivals Richard Branson and Steve Fossett. The duo called it the ''final adventure of the 20th century,'' and it would be hard to argue with them. To complete the trip, they were hurled through jet streams at speeds approaching 210 kilometres an hour, faced down ferocious storms and floated dangerously close to countries that would sooner shoot them down than see them collect the $1-million prize from brewing giant Anheuser-Busch. -- Chris Wilson-Smith

The Depression was kicking up dust and hardship across the United States, and few places felt it as squarely as the hardscrabble state of Nevada. With mining fortunes in the Silver State fizzling, legislators scrambled for new revenue sources and decided upon gambling and heartbreak. Aspiring divorcees had long flocked to Nevada and its liberal six-month residency requirement for obtaining a legal separation. In those desperate times, the state doubled down, cutting the residency law to six weeks and giving the lovelorn a new way to spend their time and money. In Reno, hotels and divorce ranches - complete with ample gaming options - popped up to accommodate the surge of demand. Las Vegas began its growth spurt in the 1940s, and today 45 per cent of Nevada's revenues come from the hotel-casino industry.-- Patrick White

From the museum's first floor, they took a small painting by Manet. From the second floor, they took five works on paper by Degas, several pieces by Rembrandt and Vermeer's painting The Concert (above). The latter, one of only 36 known Vermeers in existence, is considered the most valuable stolen painting in the world.

Rudimentary forms of rocketry had existed since the Chinese invented gunpowder.But the modern rocket era began one spring afternoon in 1926 in Auburn, Mass., when Clark University physics professor Robert Goddard erected a metal frame in a cabbage patch at the farm of his aunt, Effie. The frame held up the world's first liquid-propellant rocket. Fuelled with gasoline and liquid oxygen, his rocket rose just more than 12 metres in the air. Goddard was an eccentric character whose visionary papers on lunar travel were mocked by newspapers, but his work paved the way for a new age of flight. While more difficult to manufacture, liquid-propellant rockets have a higher thrust than powder ones and can be throttled, shut down and restarted, essential features for spacecraft - from the moon-bound Saturn V to the space shuttle. -- Tu Thanh Ha

The Moscow peace treaty marked the end of four months of fierce Finnish resistance to the Soviet Red Army. Faced with overwhelming numerical superiority, the Finns had used guerrilla tactics and their knowledge of the wintry local terrain to confound their enemy. Dressed in white camouflage, and often on skis, the Finnish units moved faster than the ponderous Soviets, who had been decimated in leadership by Stalin's purges. To counter Soviet tanks, the Finns developed an enduring weapon they called the Molotov cocktail, named for the Soviet foreign minister. Failure to secure a rapid victory was humiliating to the Soviets, but they eventually got the upper hand. Attempts at reinforcement by Britain and France were thwarted, and Finland agreed to a peace that ceded roughly one-tenth of its territory and one-third of its industrial might to the Soviets. -- Joe Friesen

Fifty-nine of its 100 passengers died, including Samuel Zimmerman, a railway investor who was one of Upper Canada's richest men. The inquiry that immediately convened established the cause: A broken axle on the locomotive had forced the train to derail and the bridge to shatter. The month-long hearing revealed that the tragedy had its roots in safety oversights that were preventable: The bridge's strength had not been tested in case of derailment. But it also brought up an enduring mystery: The reason the axle broke was never discovered. -- Simona Chiose

Until the 1930s, Canada's banks pretty much ran their own show, printing currency and handling credit without involvement from a central bank. But the Great Depression increased pressure to create an institution that would regulate credit and keep prices stable. Following the recommendations of a Royal Commission, on a late-winter Monday the Bank of Canada opened its doors in Ottawa. At first a private institution that sold shares to the public, it was later nationalized. The big change for ordinary Canadians was the appearance of new Bank of Canada currency - smaller and more colourful than the old Dominion of Canada notes or those from chartered banks. But there was some confusion about the new bank's role: A few people showed up at its offices on the first day to try to open accounts or cash cheques. -- Richard Blackwell

It took just 77 minutes for the group of retired army officers to overthrow Cuban President Carlos Prio Socarras. The early-morning coup led by former president Fulgencio Batista was not widely challenged, in large part because the regime it replaced was seen as corrupt. Batista promised Cubans a new brand of ""disciplined democracy,"" but his presidency soon took on the hallmarks of dictatorship. He won an election in 1954 in which he was the sole candidate, and developed close ties with the U.S. government and the Mafia. Corruption and police brutality were widespread during his rule, and while gambling and tourism flourished in Havana, most of the Caribbean country remained poor and undeveloped. Nearly seven years after seizing power, Batista fled Cuba as Fidel Castro's revolutionaries took control of the country. -- Kim Mackrael

Three men attempted triple Axels at the 1978 World Figure Skating Championships in Ottawa, but only one landed in the history books. Canadian Vern Taylor had never won a national title and was sitting 14th heading into the free skate. But on his third jump in a performance set to music from Rocky, the 20-year-old became the first human to complete the forward-takeoff, 3.5-revolution jump in competition. The landing wasn't perfect - he continued to rotate on the ice afterward - but he kept his balance and stayed on one foot. He finished 12th overall. Yet the placement was not what counted. Taylor had raised the standard: What had once been an unconquered Everest would soon be a requirement for serious competitors. The following year, the feat was repeated by another Canadian, a junior skater named Brian Orser. -- Joy Yokoyama

The ancient Greeks once thought the world was made of four basic elements, but by the 1860s scientists had found more than 50. In St. Petersburg, a chemistry professor named Dmitri Mendeleev was determined to make sense of it all. He produced a set of pin-up cards, one for each element, and arranged them in order of weight, starting with the lightest, hydrogen. Working down the list, he saw that some elements shared properties that repeated in a periodic way, so he formed them into columns alongside their like-behaving kin. This created gaps that Mendeleev reasoned might one day be filled by still-undiscovered elements. He was right: Six years after he presented his ""periodic table"" before the Russian Physicochemical Society, the element gallium turned up with precisely the characteristics Mendeleev predicted. -- Ivan Semeniuk

When British Overseas Airways Corp. Flight 911 took off from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, it taxied past the site of a horrific plane crash that had killed 64 people less than 24 hours earlier. The Boeing 707 would meet a similar fate: Soon after takeoff, the Hong Kong-bound plane broke apart and crashed into the forested slope of Mount Fuji, killing all 113 passengers and 11 crew members on board. Aviation experts said adverse wind conditions around the third volcanic cone may have been to blame, according to The New York Times.

Even with 20 seats reserved for white voters, Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party won a landslide victory in independent Zimbabwe's first election. Only a few weeks earlier, the guerrilla commander had returned triumphantly from exile, greeted by huge crowds. His party won 57 of the 100 seats, defeating his guerrilla rival Joshua Nkomo, and Mugabe began to consolidate his dominance over the country. Since then, the world has seen his rise and fall and rise again. He became a pariah to the West when he encouraged the violent seizure of white-owned farms; he lost the first round of the 2008 election and clung to power through brutal force and deal-making; then he made an extraordinary return with a manipulated election victory in 2013. Today, at 91, he's chairman of the African Union and the world's oldest ruling president. -- Geoffrey York

Every opera-goer knows the story: The young composer delivers a masterpiece of realism that shocks the public, whose scorn tips him into despair and early death. But that's not quite how Carmen came into the world, or how Georges Bizet left it. Carmen's first run at Paris's Opéra-Comique was actually the most successful of any Bizet opera during his lifetime. The theatre had doubts about whether a gritty story of lust and revenge would suit its family clientele, and some reviews were harsh. But Carmen satisfied a current craving for exotic tales, music and imagery from southern Spain and Morocco. The theatre was packing in the crowds when Bizet died of a heart attack on June 3. Carmen had just finished the 33rd performance of its initial 45-show run. It has seldom been absent from a stage somewhere in the world ever since. -- Robert Everett-Green

Victoria had just stepped off the train at Windsor and begun the carriage ride to her nearby castle when a bedraggled man emerged from the crowd and squeezed off a shot at the Queen. The round missed. A local photographer grabbed the gun from the would-be assassin, and several bystanders set upon him - including a pair of Eton schoolboys who whacked him over the head with their umbrellas. The shooter, a ne'er-do-well named Roderick Maclean, was found not guilty by reason of insanity and spent the rest of his life in the asylum at Broadmoor. It was the seventh time someone had tried to kill Queen Victoria who, of course, escaped every attempt and went on to become Britain's longest-reigning monarch. --  Adrian Morrow

The pop music of the past few years has been heavily populated by shiny, danceable odes to empowerment. Katy Perry roars and whatever doesn't kill Kelly Clarkson only makes her stronger. But it wasn't always that way, which is why something like the Gloria Gaynor hit I Will Survive is so memorable. A defiant, melodramatic statement written by Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris, the single in 1980 would win the inaugural Grammy for best disco recording, besting, among others, Rod Stewart's Da Ya Think I'm Sexy? and Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough. Ironically, the boogie itself was dying. By 1981, the disco prize was summarily eliminated from the Grammys, making I Will Survive not only the category's first winner, but its last. Still, the song's message message would live on. -- Brad Wheeler

The Taliban's first crack at demolishing two towering stone Buddha statues carved into cliffs in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, didn't work. The aging icons were first hit with anti-aircraft and tank fire, ""but they are very tough ones,"" as Taliban foreign minister Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil put it. They stood amid the caves at Bamiyan for more than 1,400 years, one 53 metres tall, the other 37 metres. But on Feb. 26, 2001, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar ordered all non-Islamic statues destroyed. His troops, undeterred by early failures, packed a truckload of dynamite into the sixth-century masterpieces, even as United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan pleaded for their preservation. The explosives levelled the Buddhas, and the contents of Kabul museums were similarly desecrated. Talk of rebuilding the Buddhas has resurfaced over the years, but for now only their empty outlines remain. -- James Bradshaw

The poet John Keats made the most of his short life. Hailing from tragic family circumstances - including the death of both parents before he was 14 - Keats flirted with a medical career before devoting himself to poetry in his teens. Although his first efforts were scorned by Blackwood's Magazine in 1817, Keats published his masterpiece, Endymion, the following year. That same year, he lost his brother, fell in love with Fanny Brawne and wrote a prodigious amount of poetry, including Ode to a Nightingale. In late 1820, Keats, by then racked with tuberculosis, and painter Joseph Severn went to Rome, where the poet rallied briefly but was soon bedridden. In his final moments, Keats told his friend, ''I shall die easily. Don't be frightened. Be firm, and thank God it has come.'' He was 25. -- Andrew Ryan

Many improvements to Edison's original phonograph followed, including one from his competitor, Alexander Graham Bell, who used wax in his machine instead of Edison's tin-foil-covered cylinders.

Amid renewed calls to end the ban, the hunt continues today, with some modifications: Hounds can follow a scented trail while the hunters get to enjoy a day on horseback in the countryside. The dogs are to be called off if a real quarry is cornered, and it's a bullet - not the pack - that finishes off the fox. -- Eric Atkins

On a painfully cold February morning in Ottawa, the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States and East and West Germany headed to the German ambassador's residence in Rockcliffe for breakfast. They attracted little notice: The ministers were officially in Ottawa for a conference of Warsaw Pact and NATO foreign ministers on the unexciting subject of aerial observation. Nobody would have guessed that their coffee talk, held only three months after the Berlin Wall fell, would reshape the world. Yet it was the agreement struck over that breakfast, overcoming strong resistance from Britain and France and winning the support of Moscow, that led to talks beginning in May that would create a single, reunified Germany, and thus a united Europe, and finalized the lifting of the Iron Curtain. -- Doug Saunders

Church bells tolled across Palermo to mark the start of Italy's first mass trial of the Mafia. More than 450 defendants, some held in steel cages, were guarded by 2,000 police officers in a courtroom built to resist rocket attacks. For the first time, insiders known as pentiti broke the code of silence to testify about an organized campaign of murder, kidnapping, drug deals and extortion that extended from Sicily to North America. More than 330 men were found guilty, including Michele Greco, who ordered 78 homicides including the assassination of Italian public officials. The trial did not cripple organized crime in Sicily, but six years later Giovanni Falcone, the courageous prosecutor behind the maxi-trial, was killed by a roadside bomb, fuelling an anti-Mafia backlash. -- Joe Friesen

The motion under debate at the Oxford Union - that this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country - was clearly meant to irritate the pompous and powerful. Blind, unthinking patriotism no longer seemed justifiable after the slaughter of the Great War, and the economic divide of the Depression had further undermined any instinct of jingoistic obedience. But when the anti-war resolution passed by 275-153 (thanks in part to a speech by future Canadian NDP leader David Lewis), Oxford's students were denounced as cowards whose decadent views (''abject, squalid, shameless,'' according to Winston Churchill) provided comfort to Britain's enemies. In fact, it was the tepid foreign policy of the British leadership class, not the well-chosen words of a few left-wing debaters, that gave Hitler his licence to conquer. -- John Allemang

Sir Freddie Laker saw a market for fun and affordable aviation when he founded the first low-cost transatlantic airline, Laker Airways, in 1966. By cutting out heavy cargo freight to save on fuel, charging extra for food and accepting standby passengers, Laker paved the way for today's budget flights. But as swiftly as the airline ascended, the turbulence of the early 1980s recession brought it down to Earth. With lacklustre ticket sales, even a bailout by its entrepreneur founder couldn't stave off creditors. (Sir Freddie would later blame colluding competitors for the collapse.) Facing a 270-million-pound ($515-million) debt, Laker buckled and planes were recalled to Britain, leaving some passengers in the lurch. Loyal fans tried to relaunch the airline with a crowdfunding campaign, but it was to be permanently grounded. -- Jacqueline Nelson

The Carpenters' soft rock was all sweetness and innocence, from (They Long to Be) Close to You to We've Only Just Begun. Even the melancholy of the duo of her and her brother, Richard, pictured above, was wholesome. But stardom - more than 100 million records sold, 15 No. 1 hits - intensified Karen Carpenter's struggle with her appearance. She began dieting in high school and weight loss became an obsession that we now know is a disease. By 1975, when she was an international superstar, she weighed just 91 pounds. Shortly before her 33rd birthday, Carpenter suffered heart failure and was rushed to hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The cause: ""heartbeat irregularities brought on by chemical imbalances associated with anorexia nervosa.""

His breath hissed as it froze instantly, leaving a vapour trail behind him. The cold air was so dense he could hear noises from a village five kilometres away. It was too cold for a mercury thermometer and the liquid in the alcohol instrument had dropped below the lowest graduation of -80 F (""-62.2 C). Toole estimated it was -83 F (""-63.9 C), and marked the spot by etching the glass with a file since it was too cold for a pen. The reading was later confirmed to be -81.4 F or -63 C. -- Tu Thanh Ha

The Flying Wallendas first performed without a safety net at Madison Square Garden in 1928, after this key piece of equipment got lost. The German-born founder of the family troupe, Karl Wallenda, was also said to believe that nets bred complacency. In 1962, before a crowd of 7,000 in Detroit, while crossing a highwire in a seven-person pyramid topped by a teenaged girl in a chair, a performer yelled, ""I can't hold on any more!"" All but three Wallendas fell to the floor more than 10 metres below. Two would die, and Karl's adopted son, Mario, was paralyzed for life. The girl in the chair was caught by two troupe members who did hang on. Karl himself escaped with a cracked pelvis and two hernias, and the troupe performed the next night. He died in a fall in 1978, aged 73. But his descendants, including great-grandson Nik, are still performing. -- Jeff Gray

If Dr. Strangelove taught us anything, it was that timing truly is everything in the movie business. Released at the peak of the Cold War, Stanley Kubrick's black comedy fictionalizing a nuclear showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union also arrived several weeks after the assassination of John F. Kennedy - when moviegoers needed a laugh. Using the 1958 novel Red Alert by Peter George as a framework, Kubrick shrewdly cast comedy auteur Peter Sellers in three roles: stiff RAF officer Lionel Mandrake, ineffectual U.S. president Merkin Muffley and the titular Dr. Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist plotting a new endgame for the Yanks. Sellers was supposed to play a fourth character - B-52 pilot Major T.J. (King) Kong, who rides a missile to global oblivion in the film's dire denouement - but he couldn't master the Texas accent. -- Andrew Ryan

The day before the women of the Political Equality League took the stage at Winnipeg's Walker Theatre, Conservative Premier Rodmond Roblin rejected their demand for ballot-box justice. Women were too emotional to vote, he insisted, and giving them the franchise would tear families apart. His smug reaction inspired Nellie McClung, a 40-year-old author and long-time temperance crusader. The next evening, the curtain rose on her Mock Parliament, a women-only assembly that presided over weighty affairs of state with Roblinesque complacency. When a delegation of men petitioned for male suffrage, McClung praised their ""splendid gentlemanly appearance"" but noted that politics unsettled men, leading to broken furniture and broken vows. ""Man's place,"" she concluded, was ""on the farm."" The crowd roared. Exactly two years later, with the Liberals now in power, Manitoba women got their vote. -- John Allemang

It was both a thought experiment and a call to action for the atomic era. Richard Feynman stood before the American Physical Society in Pasadena, Calif., and proposed an idea: creating things by manipulating individual atoms. Computers could be made much more compact by shrinking their circuits down to a minute size; an entire encyclopedia could be inscribed on the head of a pin; a microscope could be made powerful enough to study atoms up close. In the decades following that talk, There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, much of what Feynman imagined would come to pass. Today, we use nanotechnology in everything from computers to car bumpers. Microscopes can zoom in on single atoms. And yes, it is even possible to fill the head of a pin with tens of thousands of pages worth of text. Some of his other proposals, such as microscopic robots to perform surgery from within a patient's body, are still under development. -- Adrian Morrow

The elite of Peruvian society were feting the Emperor's birthday at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima when the explosions went off. Fourteen rebels from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement crashed the party, taking more than 400 hostages. Frightened, well-dressed revellers scrambled under tables as the rebels fired into the air and issued warnings. Among the hostages were judges, diplomats, generals and members of then-president Alberto Fujimori's family. The hostage-takers, a Marxist group led by Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, were mostly youngsters recruited from the jungle. They demanded freedom for hundreds of jailed comrades. Fujimori refused. Many hostages were released during the standoff, including 225 just before Christmas. Talks mediated by the Canadian ambassador proved futile. As the rebels played soccer on April 22, 1997, commandos stormed the mansion, setting off explosions and killing all 14 of them. -- Joy Yokoyama

Jean-Bedel Bokassa was no garden variety African despot. He seized power of the Central African Republic in 1966, calling himself President for Life. When he outgrew that title, he donned a crown encrusted with 2,000 diamonds, rubies and emeralds and proclaimed himself Emperor. His two-day coronation, including a golden eagle throne, cost $22-million, nearly bankrupting the country. Bokassa's tyrannical rule ended in 1979, when he was ousted in a coup and accused of clubbing to death schoolchildren who refused to wear uniforms made in a factory he owned. He became the first deposed African chief to be publicly tried for murder and convicted. In 2010, he was posthumously pardoned by President Francois Bozize. ''He was a builder,'' said JeanSerge Bokassa, his son. ''Unfortunately, the negative acts tarnished his image.'' -- Karen Howlett

She would later call it ''treachery with a smile on its face.'' But the simmering parliamentary revolt that forced Margaret Thatcher out of office in just three weeks was actually prompted by her stubborn Euroskepticism. Britain's first female prime minister had utterly transformed her country, irrevocably stamping its economy with a free-market mould. But the Iron Lady's uncompromising approach left both her Conservative Party and Britain bitterly divided. Her normally composed voice cracked slightly and her eyes appeared to well up with tears as she stood in front of 10 Downing St. for the last time, husband Denis standing dutifully behind her.

The original working title was The Auctioneer. Creator Bob Stewart, who was also the brains behind To Tell the Truth and The $10,000 Pyramid, liked the idea of a show where people had to bid on items. Plenty of viewers did, too. The night-time version was the most-watched prime-time game show from 1959 to 1961. Contestants typically vied for furniture, furs and household appliances, but there were special prizes, too: an island in the St. Lawrence Seaway; a mile of hot dogs; a live peacock to go with a colour TV; and a trip to Israel to appear as an extra in Otto Preminger's film Exodus. The show was revamped in 1972, with Bob Barker taking over hosting duties from Bill Cullen. The show has aired in one form or another in every decade since the 1950s. Making history, come on down! -- Dave McGinn

 The funeral of U.S. President John F. Kennedy didn't lack for stirring images. There were scores of dignitaries and world leaders; a flag-draped casket on a carriage drawn by six horses; a riderless horse with empty boots reversed in the stirrups to symbolize a fallen leader. And Jacqueline Kennedy, a picture of grief and strength in a black veil, three days after her husband was assassinated before her eyes. But the most striking picture remains that of John Kennedy Jr., apparently saluting his dad's coffin on his third birthday. It's doubtful he was aware of his actions, or their impact. But as a country and much of the world grieved a leader in whom so much hope had been placed, it was apparent that the little boy in short pants had lost much more. -- Eric Atkins

Britain was still nursing wounds from the Second World War when preparations began for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. Such a show of pageantry in an age of austerity could have spurred public anger, but instead had the cheering effect of a day off from other worries. Canada sent the couple a selection of antique silver and a mink coat. Other gifts included 200 New Brunswick lobsters and, in keeping with the times, Halifax sent a special food shipment to the British city of the same name. Elizabeth also received 80 pairs of nylon stockings from around the world. As the royal couple left for the honeymoon, the bridal bouquet was quietly laid at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster Abbey. The event had provided a balm for a nation in recovery. -- Kate Hopwood

Left-handed pitcher Sandy Koufax struck out 317 batters in the 1966 season. Then he retired, walking away from a glorious Major League Baseball career at the age of 30. ''My elbow is so arthritic. I feel I can no longer give the Dodgers my best,'' he said when he quit the game. The Los Angeles Dodger threw with speed and control to pitch four no-hitters and win the Cy Young Award three times in a career that began in 1955 and included league-leading stats in several seasons. But he is often remembered for the game he didn't play. Koufax, who is Jewish, refused to pitch in Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on Yom Kippur. When he returned to the mound for Games 5 and 7, he won both times and the Dodgers claimed the championship. -- Eric Atkins

But the 10 men and one woman who first acquitted Morgentaler on charges of performing an illegal abortion in Montreal set a pattern that would stick for successive juries. The day after the verdict, Morgentaler was back at work in his Montreal clinic, confident that public opinion would pave the way for women to access abortions ''safely and with dignity instead of going to butchers.''

So when Bill Gates unveiled a new operating system called Windows 1.0, people braced for a big overhaul. For $99 (U.S.), the software would be able to run multiple programs at once - things such as a notepad, calendar, clock and Windows Paint. Gates promised Windows would be compatible with 90 per cent of IBM computers. There was one small catch: The software wouldn't ship for two more years. Windows customers would have to learn to be patient - a virtue often practised since that day. -- Amberly McAteer

Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, who saw him as a hybrid beast born of our most destructive capacities, was inspired to make the film when the United States tested the largest thermonuclear weapon ever detonated in March, 1954. The 15-megaton hydrogen bomb wiped out three South Pacific islands and rained radioactive fallout on a distant Japanese fishing boat. Tanaka worked that story into his film: ""Mankind had created 'the Bomb,' and now nature was going to take revenge."" Today, the movie looks corny (the monster is a man in a suit stomping a miniature city), but it was the most expensive Japanese film ever made when it premiered in Tokyo.

The devoted nun who arrived with his morning coffee at 4:30 a.m. got no answer to her knock. She tried again, and allegedly found the 65-year-old pontiff sitting upright, papers in hand, stone-cold dead.

''Pretty woman, I don't believe you,'' Roy Orbison sang, his disbelief seemingly sincere and not a pick-up line. ''No one could look as good as you.'' With Bill Dees in 1964, Orbison co-wrote Oh, Pretty Woman in praise of his first wife, Claudette, after the two had divorced and then reunited. As a pop song, it lacked for nothing, with a rock-steady snare-drum beat, iconic twangy riff, fragile vocal plead and playful cat growl that ensured its evergreen status. It was a departure from Orbison's typical heartbreak conceit, and the unexpected good fortune at the song's end resolved a lilting tension charismatically. Would the woman walk away? Would she make the protagonist cry? No, she would not. She walked back to him - a dream come true and hope for the lonely. ''Mercy, '' indeed. -- Brad Wheeler

But when navigation commands were sent in English units instead of metric, the orbiter hit the atmosphere at a low altitude. It could not have survived the resulting friction and stress, and no signal was ever re-established. The MCO was half of the $193-million (U.S.) Mars Surveyor ''98 program; the other half, the Mars Polar Lander, was to arrive about two months later, so NASA said at the time that the disappearance of the orbiter ''is not necessarily science lost; it is science delayed.''

Dropped into a prime-time landscape that still included The Brady Bunch and My Three Sons, the premise cast Moore as Mary Richards, a single woman relocated to Minneapolis, Minn., after a bad breakup. In short order, she landed a bachelorette pad, a new bestie named Rhoda (Valerie Harper) and a producer job on WJM-TV's evening newscast. The first two seasons followed Mary through wacky scenarios with boss Lou (Ed Asner), co-worker Murray (Gavin McLeod) and dim newsman Ted (Ted Knight). But by season three it was touching on such important issues as equal pay and divorce. By showing viewers that single women on TV need not be widows or wallflowers, the show paved the way for Sex and the City and Girls. Thanks, Mary. -- Andrew Ryan

Inspectors found the fish to be rancid, decomposed and unfit for human consumption. But the New Brunswick tuna factory that processed and canned it argued the assessment was unfair, and threatened to shut down the plant if the rejected products couldn't be sold. An investigation by CBC's The Fifth Estate revealed that federal Fisheries Minister John Fraser used his authority to overrule government inspectors and allow nearly one million cans of tainted tuna to be sold in Canadian stores. The revelation caused a national scandal: Fraser resigned from cabinet shortly after the program aired on Sept. 17, and StarKist eventually closed its New Brunswick plant as its Canadian sales plummeted. Fraser, however, proved that there is life after political scandal: He was elected Speaker of the House of Commons the next year. -- Kim Mackrael

After leading a life large enough for its own opera, Maria Callas's sparkling soprano voice was silenced by a heart attack in her Paris home at the age of 53. Born Maria Anna Sofia Cecilia Kalogeropoulos in New York in 1923, Callas, the daughter of a Greek pharmacist, electrified the opera world in the 1950s and ''60s, reviving previously neglected bel canto works. Offstage, she played the role of diva to perfection, waging feuds with conductors and rivals, and bailing on performances over fees. Her marriage to an Italian businessman was ended by her tempestuous affair with shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. In the 1970s, Callas's voice faltered. She once told Life magazine she made no apologies for being difficult: ''To me, the art of music is magnificent, and I cannot bear to see it treated in a shabby way.'' -- Jeff Gray

One of the world's most famous sculptures was originally intended to gaze out over the Italian city of Florence from atop a Gothic cathedral, but Michelangelo's weighty David never made it to the roof. Carved in Carrara marble, the figure of the young biblical hero who slew the giant Goliath and went on to become king would instead live out the Renaissance from a perch in front of the town hall, now known as Palazzo Vecchio. Naked and armed only with a slingshot, David was the embodiment of strength in a city also grappling with giant issues, from aggressive neighbours to income inequality. While a replica of David still stands outside Palazzo Vecchio, the original has been sheltered in the Accademia Gallery since 1873. -- Jacqueline Nelson

At 4:50 a.m., traffic across Sweden ground to a halt as drivers were directed to switch lanes and stop their vehicles. As the clock struck 5, cars, trucks and bicycles resumed their journeys - and, for the first time since 1734, they kept to the right side of the road. Prior to H-Day (H for hogertrafikomlaggningen, ''the right-hand traffic diversion''), Sweden was the last country in mainland Europe to drive on the left, even though most Swedes at the time had American-made cars designed for right-side driving. The switch was unpopular, but the biggest difficulties were logistical: Streetcar doors and bus stops were in the wrong places, some 360,000 street signs needed changing and one-way streets were a special nightmare. -  Kate Hopwood

Great events often arise from small causes. Take the Great Fire of London: It began on a warm, dry Sunday morning when embers from the ovens of the King's baker ignited a stretch of houses tightly packed along Pudding Lane near London Bridge. Most houses in the city of 500,000 were made of wood and there was no fire department, so when a strong east wind arose, the flames spread rapidly, consuming more than 70 per cent of the city before being extinguished on Sept. 5. Tens of thousands were left homeless, yet the official death toll was fewer than 10 people. Hopes that the conflagration would result in a new grid street system were dashed when Charles II decided the old, convoluted routes should be retained. But Christopher Wren got to design 52 churches, including St. Paul's Cathedral, completed in 1711. -- James Adams

The American presence in the remote islands had begun when the first missionaries arrived in 1820, but it was during the 1898 Spanish-American war, when the strategic importance of the naval base at Pearl Harbor became clear, that U.S. interest in the islands 4,000 kilometres west of its mainland was cemented.

When you're making a run for it, maybe a steamship is a bad place to be. Hawley Crippen and his young lover, Ethel Le Neve, thought they'd dodged a murder warrant when they boarded the Canadian Pacific liner Montrose in Antwerp en route to Quebec. But the ship's captain had been reading newspaper reports about the London murder and dismemberment of Dr. Crippen's showgirl wife, Cora. He saw through the two fugitives' disguises – Ethel was dressed up as a boy – and sent a wireless message to inform British authorities. Scotland Yard's lead investigator immediately hopped on a faster Atlantic liner and nabbed the pair nine days later when the Montrose stopped to take on river pilots in Pointe-au-Pere, Que. Dr. Crippen was executed four months alter, and carried his acquitted lover's photo to the grave. – John Allemang",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10152545027013904/?type=3,2014-07-31 14:40:05,39,10,10,39,0,0,0,0,0

Doctors prescribed thalidomide for pregnant women who felt nauseous or worried. But the German-made drug that was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s caused children to be born without arms or legs, among other deformities. The drug was pulled off the shelves in Europe when its effects became known, yet it remained available in Canada for several more months. On July 30, 1973, the company that sold the drug in Britain, Distiller Co., agreed to pay $36.8-million to more than 400 children who were thalidomide victims. More than 100 Canadian children born with the devastating effects of the drug were not as fortunate. They had to fight individually for compensation, which came in varied amounts, and with gag orders that kept the details secret. – Eric Atkins",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10152542766588904/?type=3,2014-07-30 13:01:16,42,10,20,42,0,0,0,0,0

When it came to California dreaming in the late 1960s, there were musical options. While the Beach Boys preached good vibrations, the San Francisco bands embodied a stoned utopia. From the Doors, it was moonlight drives, Hollywood bungalows and weird scenes from inside the gold mines. Their first hit was Light my Fire, a drug alluding psychedelic-pop trip about a love that couldn't get much higher. The sprawling album version was a team effort by rock originals. Singer Jim Morrison's baritone-inspired croon implored ominously, Ray Manzarek's organ solo was baroque-inspired and Robby Krieger's six-string flight had a flamenco flourish. Drummer John Densmore started it all off with the snap of his snare, as if to signal an announcement – the time to hesitate was through.

The ships had detected each other on radar and the men on the bridges believed they would calmly pass in the night. But just after 11 p.m., the bow of the Stockholm stabbed the starboard side of the Andrea Doria, ripping a hole in the glamorous Italian liner, causing it to tilt, and setting off a massive rescue operation. A half-dozen ships joined the Swedish liner in picking up Doria survivors from the Atlantic, 70 kilometres off Nantucket island in Massachusetts. Desperate passengers struggled to free loved ones from debris, parents flung their children overboard to lifeboats and others searched for missing family members. In total, 1,660 passengers and crew were saved, while 46 Doria passengers and five Stockholm crew perished. At 10:09 a.m. on July 26, the Doria disappeared beneath the waves. - Joy Yokoyama

''This is the place,'' declared Brigham Young upon his first sighting of the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Along with a handful of Mormon followers, Young arrived at the barren location after a year-and-a-half-long trek initiated by the murder of Joseph Smith, the Christian sect's founder and first leader. As Smith's successor, Young had the responsibility of finding a new home for the Mormon pioneers back in western Iowa. Within days of arrival, Young and his companions began building shelter at the foot of the Wasatch mountains and designated the site of the Salt Lake Temple. In years to follow, Young escorted thousands to Utah, mostly by wagon and handcart. By 1852, the Mormon population in the new promised land numbered 16,000; by 1869 they were 80,000 strong. And thus Salt Lake City was born. - Andrew Ryan

It was the brief journey of the Royal Yacht Britannia that officially marked the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway and unlocked the Great Lakes ports of Chicago, Toronto, Hamilton, Detroit and Thunder Bay to the rest of the world. The Queen, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and a throng of lesser dignitaries boarded the vessel at Montreal for a trip through the St. Lambert Lock. In fact, the seaway had opened two months earlier, but the pomp awaited the arrival of the monarch and her sleek blue ship, sailing gracefully down the channel. Whistles blew, rockets exploded and miniature flags of the United States, Britain and Canada were sprayed through the air.

Jailed for 27 years and still barred from voting in his own country, Nelson Mandela received a hero's welcome when he travelled to Canada in 1990, just months after his release. Parliamentarians gave the South African anti-apartheid leader a standing ovation in Ottawa and throngs of admirers gathered to hear him speak at Queen's Park. But it was during a smaller assembly at a Toronto high school that Mandela appeared most at ease. ''What is more comforting to a man of my age than to know I have the support of future leaders of the world?'' he told the group of about 1,000 students. Four years later, Mandela would became South Africa's first black president, marking a turning point in the country's history.

Albert Schweitzer opined, ""There are two means of refuge from life's miseries: music and cats."" How much solace Giuseppe Verdi took from felines during his 87 years is unclear. But music? The proof's in his stature as the world's pre-eminent opera composer. To think it could have been otherwise! Near-crippling tragedies struck early in Verdi's career - the deaths of his daughter at 17 months in 1838, then his son at 15 months in 1839 and finally Margherita, 26, his wife of fewer than four years. Dispirited, Verdi swore never to write again. Luckily, the vow did not hold, thanks to an inspiring chance encounter with what became the libretto to Nabucco. Mounted at La Scala in 1842, it was the first in a long string of successes for the composer, including Rigoletto and La Traviata. -- James Adams

It could almost have been June 14.

Nora didn't show, prompting the legendary author to write her to propose a new plan. Two days later, they strolled the city's Ringsend district and legend has it Joyce later told Barnacle she ""made him a man"" on that day. No matter what happened, he made sure the day endured by setting his masterpiece, Ulysses, on June 16, 1904. Now the date is known as Bloomsday, celebrated in Ireland since 1954, the original's 50th anniversary.

Stan Rogers had just played the renowned Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas when he boarded Air Canada Flight 797 in Dallas en route to Toronto. At 33, the Hamilton-born singer-songwriter with a booming baritone voice and a feel for working people's concerns was a stalwart of Canadian folk music. At 33,000 feet, a fire broke out in the DC-9's washroom, billowing toxic smoke and knocking out electrical circuits. The plane made it safely to the ground in Cincinnati, Ohio, and passengers started escaping on slides. But the open doors brought an inrush of oxygen and ignited a flash fire that killed 23 passengers who had yet to get out. Musician Shari Ulrich told the CBC last year that Rogers seemed ""possessed"" when he played. ""He was unstoppable. Until, of course, that fateful day."" -- Jane Gadd

""When you are out wheeling,"" Rick Hansen said at the midpoint of his 40,000-kilometre Man in Motion tour, ""there is nowhere to hide."" He was describing the singular focus, even loneliness, of his odyssey. But by the time Hansen rolled into Vancouver, 792 days and 160 worn-out tires after he'd left, the thousands of Canadians cheering him on demonstrated he was far from alone. Paralyzed from the waist down at age 15, Hansen was an accomplished wheelchair marathoner before launching his 34-country tour to raise funds for spinal cord research. His determination inspired millions of people and the tour raised $26-million. Today, the Rick Hansen Foundation has raised 10 times that amount and its founder remains a national hero. ""Be the best you can with what you have,"" Hansen said. ""That's what counts in life."" -- Kate Hopwood

The return of Bobby Ewing to Dallas came as quite a shock. Viewers sensibly assumed the character played by Patrick Duffy was gone forever after he was run over by a car while valiantly trying to save ex-wife Pam (Victoria Principal) in the prime-time soap's eighth season. But in the closing moments of the ninth-season finale, Pam - on the day of her wedding to Mark Graison (John Beck) - was stunned to discover a naked and perfectly healthy Bobby in her shower. The truth behind Bobby's comeback: Duffy had left the show for other acting opportunities that never materialized, and requested his character's reprise. For the 10th season, Dallas writers simply reframed the entire previous season as one long, feverish dream by Pam. You could get away with a lot more on TV in those days. -- Andrew Ryan

At 65, back from political exile, the lion roared again. On May 10, Hitler's army invaded France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and Britain's government fell. King George VI invited the canny old warrior Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to lead the country through the coming storm. Three days later, Churchill struck a war cabinet and pledged in his first speech to Parliament ''to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime.'' Having already served his country in various conflicts as a soldier and Secretary of War, he was armed and ready with the first great rhetorical blast of his new role: ''I have nothing to offer,'' he told politicians who would put aside partisanship to defeat the enemy, ''but blood, toil, tears and sweat.'' -- Elizabeth Renzetti

In spring, 1974, after witnessing a particularly seismic performance from a relatively unknown troubadour opening for established act Bonnie Raitt in Cambridge, Mass., music writer Jon Landau crowed excitably in the Boston alternative weekly The Real Paper. ''I saw rock and roll's future,'' wrote Landau, ''and its name is Bruce Springsteen.'' When the Columbia label used the quote in an ensuing ad campaign, sales of Springsteen's second album spurted noticeably. Landau, having already invested his reputation, strapped his hands across Springsteen's engines by becoming his manager and co-producing his breakthrough 1975 album Born to Run. The disc went gold, Time and Newsweek ran concurrent cover stories on the angst-ridden, anthemic artist, and the prophecy was fulfilled. -- Brad Wheeler

Long before cable fare and reality TV, viewers were invested in the relationship between bartender/Lothario Sam Malone and waitress/intellectual-wannabe Diane Chambers on Cheers. Played by Ted Danson and Shelley Long, the tempestuous couple were booked to walk down the aisle in the fifth-season finale of the 1980s sitcom, but forces were at work behind the scenes: Danson had renewed his contract, but Long had decided to chase a film career. In the closer, I Do, Adieu, Diane learned that a publisher loved one of her manuscripts. When the wedding day arrived, Diane was willing but Sam persuaded her to pursue her literary dreams and underscored his support by telling her to ""have a good life"" - twice. Long's movie career fizzled (Troop Beverly Hills, anyone?), but Danson remains a prime-time staple. -- Andrew Ryan

Ellen DeGeneres scooped herself with the announcement that her sitcom persona was gay. The comedy veteran was the reason to watch These Friends of Mine, a top show in 1994. ABC changed the name to Ellen, and by the fourth season there were rumblings that bookstore manager Ellen Morgan might acknowledge her same-sex preference. On April 14, 1997, DeGeneres was on the cover of Time magazine with the words: ''Yep, I'm Gay.'' Two weeks later, more than 42 million U.S. viewers watched the coming-out episode, which guest-starred Laura Dern. But ratings sagged by the end of the season and ABC pulled the plug. The real Ellen married Portia de Rossi in 2008 and reinvented herself on daytime TV. -- Andrew Ryan

They are portraits of pain. Alone and unsmiling, the children in the snapshots were orphaned or separated from their families in the wave of refugees who left the Rwandan civil war and genocide that killed almost one million people. On April 28, 250,000 Rwandans flooded into neighbouring Tanzania, the biggest and fastest one-day movement the United Nations had ever seen. By the end of the year, more than 100,000 Rwandan children were without a parent and dependent on aid agencies for food, water and safety. Thousands of refugee photos, shot on film donated by Kodak, were circulated among refugee camps and would help Save the Children find the parents of 40,000 children. -- Eric Atkins

In a bizarre Cold War moment, 10-year-old Samantha Smith posed the question that terrified hundreds of millions of adults. In a letter to Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, she asked: ""Please tell me how you are going to help to not have a war."" The innocent missive ended up in Pravda, and the world's media descended on Samantha's Maine home. She wanted an answer, so in a second letter she pressed Andropov for a reply. This time he wrote back, calling her a ""courageous and honest girl"" and inviting her family for a two-week summer visit. Mikhail Gorbachev later said he was much moved by Samantha's plea. Ronald Reagan hailed ""her idealism and unaffected sweetness of spirit"" after she died in a 1985 plane crash. Three months later, Gorbachev and Reagan met for the first of the summits that ended the Cold War. -- Paul Koring

In her 21 books, Lucy Maud Montgomery always provided happy endings. Her feisty heroines - most famously red-haired Anne Shirley - invariably defeated the naysayers who undermine the dreams of the young. A happy ending eluded Montgomery herself. She died at 67 at her Toronto home, officially of coronary thrombosis but more likely of a self-inflicted overdose, a circumstance her descendants revealed only six years ago. A bedside note read: ''May God forgive me. ... My position is too awful to endure.'' The depression that claimed her sprang from her miserable marriage to a mentally ill clergyman who never read her novels, and from the shame of her elder son's criminal behaviour. Diagnosed with ""neurasthenia,"" she was prescribed barbiturates and bromides, whose dangers weren't understood. Barbiturates are habit forming and bromides, toxic. She is buried in Cavendish, PEI, a place of pilgrimage for her readers from around the world. -- Judy Stoffman

Cree playwright Tomson Highway's Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing was enthusiastically received in its world premiere at Toronto's Theatre Passe Muraille. A co-production with Native Earth Performing Arts, it would go on to nab the Chalmers and four Dora Mavor Moore awards. A follow-up to The Rez Sisters, the tragicomic play focused on the tribulations of men living on the fictional Wasaychigan Hill reserve who are threatened by the creation of a women's hockey league. In the cast were Gary Farmer, Ben Cardinal and Graham Greene. When Dry Lips transferred to the Royal Alexandra Theatre two years later, with the backing of Mirvish Productions, it became the first work by an aboriginal dramatist to have a commercial run on that historic stage. -- J. Kelly Nestruck

NOTE: This post incorrectly said the play was the first non-musical by any Canadian to be staged at the Royal Alexandra Theatre. There were other Canadian plays previously, and we have edited the post to corect it.

Fame is fickle. Talent will out. Looks are deceiving. All those clichés can be applied to Susan Boyle in the wake of her appearance as a contestant on ITV's Britain's Got Talent. When the portly, unemployed, 47-year-old Scot took the stage to sing I Dreamed a Dream from Les Misérables on April 11, expectations were not high - certainly among the studio audience and the judges, including the acerbic Simon Cowell. Boyle, of course, went on to wow them - and 11 million Britons watching on the telly. But this was only the beginning. Within four days, Boyle's triumphant performance had gone viral, drawing more than four million views on YouTube alone. Today they number more than 200 million. Six weeks after her debut, Boyle was signing a recording contract with ... Simon Cowell. -- James Adams

It was a rocky road to marital bliss. They met in 1970, both 23. Camilla was said to have whispered to the future king: ""My great-grandmother was your great-great-grandfather's mistress, so how about it?"" But they went on to marry other people. By 1992, it became public - that tampon comment - just how much Charles was devoted to her. They divorced within a year of one another. Camilla was Public Enemy No. 1, seen as the wrecker of a home and a fairy tale. They kept their romance quiet in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death in 1997. When they married in a civil ceremony, the Queen and Prince Philip didn't attend, lest they upset traditionalists. (They were present at a later blessing.) But Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, is now an accepted member of The Firm. Some even say she'll be called Queen one day. -- Sarah Hampson

Never mind that the Spanish were calling his conduct piratical. Francis Drake kneeled to be knighted by Queen Elizabeth I on the deck of the Golden Hind, the ship he captained through the first circumnavigation of the globe, a trip of 58,000 kilometres. Drake set out in 1577 with five ships and a royal commission to cross the Atlantic Ocean, explore the Pacific and disrupt Spanish shipping. Down two vessels when he passed through the Strait of Magellan in 1578, he soon lost two more in stormy weather. Only the Golden Hind moved up the Pacific coast, attacking and plundering Spanish merchants and claiming California as New Albion. Drake crossed the Pacific in 68 days and, after a three-year voyage, finally docked at Plymouth harbour in 1580, lighter on men but heavy with treasure and spices. -- James Bradshaw

The self-taught interviewer ruled the airwaves for more than two decades with her take-no-prisoners approach with everyone from Brian Mulroney to Margaret Thatcher to Nelson Mandela. Barbara Frum became a daily presence in our lives in 1971, at the helm of CBC Radio's As It Happens, and later as a host of The Journal on TV. Despite her tough style, her audience felt so close to her that when Frum once checked into an Alberta hotel, the entire staff lined up to meet her. Only her very tight circle knew she'd been battling leukemia for 18 years, so the news of her death at 54 shocked the country. As friends and colleagues paid tribute, we learned Frum was also an accomplished gardener, called her mother daily and had discreetly come to the aid of many.

As one of her producers put it, she became a den mother to a whole country. -- Alison Gzowski

On a moonless night in Lower Silesia, 76 Allied airmen (nine of them Canadian) made their way out of a cramped 102-metre tunnel named Harry and ran for their lives into enemy territory. The escape from escape-proof Stalag Luft III, immortalized in a 1963 film that unnecessarily added Steve McQueen and his wire-jumping motorcycle, was achieved by meticulous preparations. Three nine-metre-deep tunnels (Tom, Dick and Harry) were built with bits of tin cans, planks from prison bunks and stolen wiring. Scroungers weaselled maps from guards, forgers faked travel documents and tailors made passable civilian clothes out of coarse blankets. Tonnes of excavated sand were scattered on parade grounds and prison gardens. But only three men made it home; 23 were reimprisoned and 50 executed on Hitler's orders. -- John Allemang

""American woman, stay away from me,"" the song went, ""American woman, mama let me be."" It was a rugged FM staple that became the Guess Who's breakthrough hit in the U.S. despite its less than red-white-and-blue bent. The song was invented spontaneously at a concert in a curling rink outside Toronto, where Burton Cummings came up with the undiplomatic themes while Randy Bachman struck a stuttering guitar riff. ""It wasn't political,"" Winnipeg-bred Cummings would explain. ""What I was paraphrasing was 'Canadian women, I prefer you.' "" Later he added lines about ghetto scenes and war machines, which should have cut close to the American bone. Instead, the song became an ironic anthem. Pat Nixon was the one mama who would not let the Guess Who be. She banned the song from the White House. -- Brad Wheeler

It wasn't the apocalypse that Shoko Asahara had predicted, but the carnage unleashed on Tokyo's subway by followers of the doomsday cult leader scarred Japan. Five men released colourless, odourless sarin gas in train cars on three central Tokyo lines, bent on ultimately ushering in Armageddon as prophesied by Asahara, the half-blind ''Venerated Master' of the Aum Shinrikyo religious sect. Crowds of confused rush-hour commuters were left gasping, blood gushing from their noses and mouths. The attack killed 13 people, injured at least 5,500 and prompted a massive manhunt. After two months, authorities captured Asahara, who was hiding at an Aum compound, and rounded up some 200 sect members. The last of Aum's leaders was caught only in 2012. -- James Bradshaw

In less than four minutes, the 43-year-old jobless shopkeeper aimed and pulled the trigger more than 100 times before putting the muzzle in his mouth and killing himself. Ten children and three adults were treated at hospital but lived. Among the children lined up for the next gym class was a boy named Andy Murray, who was unhurt and would go on to become a star tennis player. The massacre, carried out by a misfit known to police, prompted Britain to ban private ownership of handguns and semi-automatic weapons.  -- Eric Atkins

Though Corn Flakes were sugar-free and tasteless in their earliest incarnation, the cereal eventually became a breakfast staple around the world. Their creator, John Harvey Kellogg, was a Seventh-day Adventist who invented the foodstuff to fill out the diets of patients at his ""healthy living"" sanitarium in Battle Creek, Mich. His more enterprising brother Will added sugar to the recipe shortly after. The commercialization of corn flakes created a rift between them, and John sued Will to prevent him selling the product. John lost, Will formed his own company and marketed Kellogg's Corn Flakes to the hilt. For the rest of his days, John distanced himself from his invention and devoted his time to the sanitarium, which remained open until a year before his death in 1943 at age 91. Will died eight years later, also 91 but considerably wealthier. -- Andrew Ryan

Headache? Or maybe your doctor has told you to take one daily to help prevent heart disease or stroke. When you reach for the most common drug in household medicine cabinets - the painkiller we consume more than 40,000 tonnes of every year - think of Felix Hoffman. He was the chemist named on the patent for Friedrich Bayer & Co.'s first major product. But don't forget the name Arthur Eichengrun. Rumour - and an article Eichengrun wrote in 1949 - suggest Hoffman was merely carrying out Eichengrun's research, for which he never got credit. Talk about a bitter pill to swallow. Folk remedies used salicylic acid from willow bark to relieve pain. What Bayer produced was a stable, palatable form of acetylsalicylic acid, first in powder form and later in a tablet. The rest is quick-fix, pill-popping cultural history. -- Sarah Hampson

Rodney King was hardly the first black man beaten by police, but a then-rare amateur videotape of the vicious, systematic attack captured the grim, often racist reality of U.S. inner cities. When the baton-swinging, Taser-firing LAPD officers were acquitted, President George H.W. Bush said he was ""stunned."" Riots erupted. By the time troops restored order, 53 people had died and more than 2,300 were injured. As L.A. burned, King issued his famous plea: ""Can we all get along?"" Eventually a second, federal trial sent two officers to prison. King won a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, married and divorced one of the jurors, battled drug addiction, became a minor celebrity and had multiple run-ins with the law. He drowned accidentally at age 47 with alcohol, cocaine and marijuana in his blood. - Paul Koring

Adolf Hitler didn't have hippies in mind when he commissioned the Volkswagen. Designed by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930s, the ""people's car"" was meant to be an affordable family automobile in a Germany where car ownership was a luxury enjoyed by just one in 50. The dictator envisioned his people touring the homeland on newly-built autobahns. Though an assembly plant was opened on this date, Volkswagens weren't produced in large numbers until after the war. The Beetle, with its simple, air-cooled engine in the rear and rounded corners, became one of the best-selling cars of the century. Sales in North America took off in the 1960s, when the Beetle and its bigger brother the Volkswagen bus were embraced by the peace-loving counterculture, festooned with flowers and full of unwashed shaggy types. -- Eric Atkins

It wasn't unusual for Israeli physician Baruch Goldstein to pray at the Tomb of Abraham in the West Bank town of Hebron, and it was normal for a settler like him to carry his submachine gun. So Israeli guards didn't bat an eye when Goldstein strode past them. Muslims that day were marking the holy month of Ramadan in their mosque next to the tomb, while Israelis in the adjacent room celebrated the feast of Purim, which recalls Jews escaping a death sentence in ancient Persia. Goldstein was on a Purim mission of his own. A disciple of the anti-Arab rabbi Meir Kahane, he opened fire on the Muslims kneeling before him, killing 29 and wounding dozens before being beaten to death by survivors. Forty days later, Hamas retaliated with its first suicide bombing, killing eight Israelis in Afula. The peace process has never recovered. -- Patrick White

Though the current generation may know the ubiquitous coffee chain was named for a hockey player, it's unlikely they are aware of the events leading to the death of its namesake at age 44. By 1974, the sturdy defenceman from Cochrane, Ont., had spent 25 seasons in the NHL, mostly with the Toronto Maple Leafs, and was making good money from the coffee-and-doughnut empire he launched in 1964. Buffalo Sabres general manager Punch Imlach enticed Horton to play the 1973-74 season with a bonus - a De Tomaso Pantera sports car. Following a game between the Sabres and Leafs in Toronto, Horton was driving the vehicle back to Buffalo when he lost control. Not wearing a seatbelt, he was ejected 60 metres and pronounced dead at a local hospital. -- Andrew Ryan

Casson joined the Group of Seven in 1926, stepping in after Frank Johnston left for Winnipeg, there were no more big battles to fight. The group had won over critics with its mission of creating a distinctive Canadian style; it disbanded six years later. Casson preferred watercolour over the oil favoured by the group, and his heart belonged in the villages and farms of Southern Ontario rather than rough northern landscapes. But as the last surviving member, he was the group's longest-serving ambassador. And when he died at 93, earning a place beside five other members on the grounds of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, critic John Bentley Mays wrote that the group ""quietly, suddenly became distant, as every artistic movement becomes distant once its last storyteller has died."" -- Simon Houpt

Jacqueline Kennedy, then just 31, led an hour-long televised tour of the newly restored White House, a project she had overseen with the aim of showcasing U.S. history and design. It was a broadcasting sensation, reshaping the way Americans related to their leading family, burnishing the aura surrounding the Kennedy White House and turning the first lady into a major celebrity.

The end result was not only good politics but also compelling diplomacy: A version of the show was later broadcast in countries all over the world.

Kennedy, meanwhile, was awarded an honorary Emmy for her role as host. -- Joanna Slater

This was the Portland Vase, a superb Roman cameo-glass vessel dating to the early first century, entrusted to the museum by its owner, the 3rd Duke of Portland, in 1810. Lloyd, a university student, was packed off to prison (briefly) while the museum brought in a restorer to put its treasure together again. Fortunately, near-identical copies made decades earlier by the famous Josiah Wedgwood could be consulted. Unfortunately, 37 tiny fragments were left over and vanished from sight until 1948, when another restoration was done. -- James Adams

His father had been successfully treated for the same disease. And no, he wouldn't be stepping down as party leader, just taking a little time off for treatment. It seemed obvious he would recover. And he did - rallying to lead his party to Official Opposition status a year later when Quebeckers embraced him en masse as ""un bon Jack.""

His authority came from God, Charles insisted, and only God could take it away. Yet there he was on the scaffold outside the Banqueting House in London's Whitehall district, forced to bend to parliamentarians who'd judged him guilty of treason. In better times, for him if not for the country that he reduced to civil war, the Banqueting House was a symbol of royal grandeur - Charles commissioned the Rubens paintings that still decorate its opulent ceiling. Now it was the setting of monarchy's end. On a chilly afternoon, Charles wore two shirts to prevent the shivering that might be mistaken for fear. He tucked his flowing locks under a humble cap to make the executioner's job easier. When he stretched out his arms - the agreed sign that he was ready - the blade descended and England became a republic. -- John Allemang

Thousands lined the banks of the Niagara River to watch the bridge twist and buckle under the tonnes of ice that had been piling up around its base since an earlier storm. The steel-arch bridge, which connected Ontario with New York state, was known for swaying and there were plans to replace the 40-year-old structure long before it fell onto the ice. Mother Nature sped up those plans. The final pieces of the Honeymoon Bridge sank in April, after the springtime thaw. Its replacement, the Rainbow Bridge, would open in late 1941 and stands to this day. The new bridge was built 150 metres downriver from the old one, and its abutments are well away from the fast-flowing river and the ice grinding below. -- Eric Atkins

The illegitimate son of a Scottish farmhand, MacDonald had been declared politically dead a few years earlier for suggesting at the outset of the First World War that Britain was ""morally wrong"" for declaring war on Germany. His government only lasted a few months. He won another minority in 1929, but formed a coalition government two years later with the Conservatives and Liberals. The Labour Party never forgave him for joining with the hated Tories and drummed him out of the party in 1935. He died two years later. No wonder current Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband models his policies after a different politician from roughly the same era: Theodore Roosevelt. -- Paul Waldie

But a key moment in the Holocaust took place in the leafy Berlin suburb of Wannsee. Fifteen high-ranking Nazis and bureaucrats met at a lakeside villa to coordinate the systematic, total annihilation of all of Europe's 11 million Jews. In cold, clinical language, the conference minutes repeatedly speak of the ""final solution of the Jewish question,"" a euphemism for deportation, forced labour and mass executions.

They organized a protest rally at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park under the moniker The Human Be-In, a good-humoured riff on the dozens of protest sit-ins that had begun to spring up on U.S. college campuses. The event attracted some of the biggest names of the nascent hippie movement, including Harvard professor and LSD advocate Timothy Leary, who took to the stage to utter the famous phrase: ""Turn on, tune in, drop out."" The music was provided by some of the most iconic bands of that era, including Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead. Many of those in attendance had wandered over from the city's Haight-Ashbury district, which would become the epi-centre of the counter-culture phenomenon. Five months later, the Summer of Love would begin. -- Gary Mason

Oil from the Spindletop well, about 140 kilometres east of Houston, shot up 60 metres into the sky, launching Texas's first energy boom and making America a dominant energy player. The geyser took days to harness and a land rush followed, as did the boom and bust of Beaumont, the neighbouring town. Spindletop, at the time, became the world's most plentiful oilfield and Chevron Corp., the modern-day powerhouse, is one of the companies that owes its existence to the find. But forget oil. Without Spindletop, there would be a yawning gap in U.S. pop culture: Texas, after all, had to boom in order for Dallas, the oil-soaked soap opera, to flourish. -- Carrie Tait

In 1978, citing Bill 101's ban on discrimination against francophones, the corporate giant announced it was heading to Toronto, along with 1,800 jobs. Jacques Parizeau, then finance minister, called it a final chapter for ""one of the worst corporate citizens Quebec has known."" Four years later, Sun Life picked a British firm over a lower Quebec bid to build a Toronto headquarters.

Robert FitzRoy, whose predecessor had shot himself in a fit of desolation, was leading a surveying expedition to the remotest parts of South America, and sought out a paying passenger who was keen to explore the land while he charted the coasts of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. For weeks the Beagle waited for a favourable wind in the stormy waters off Plymouth, making several failed attempts to reach the open sea. At Christmas, the crew drank heavily and were too hung over to sail. Finally, on Dec. 27, sobriety and decent weather came together. The Beagle weighed anchor, and a seasick Darwin began his life-changing five-year voyage. -- John Allemang

140961138903_10152061948873904,"Moment in time: Dec. 24, 1871, Verdi's Aida premieres in Cairo -- The first performance of Verdi's epic opera Aida took place in a three-tiered theatre in Cairo that held only 850. A paper airplane thrown from the cheap seats might have hit the painted sets, which had finally arrived after being trapped in Paris for several months by the Franco-German war. The opera, set in ancient Egypt, deals with the travails of a captive Ethiopian princess. The viceroy of Egypt, who built the theatre and commissioned the opera, was happy. But Verdi, who did not attend, was annoyed to hear later that the house was too small to hold anyone but invited guests and critics. He always regarded Aida's Milan debut in 1872 as the opera's true premiere. The opera house went bankrupt in 1887, burned down in 1971, and was replaced with a multi-tiered parking lot called Opera Garage. -- Robert Everett-Green

Bush when he was running the agency. U.S. Special Forces blew up Noriega's personal gunboat and jet to prevent him escaping. The invasion involved thousands of troops, hundreds of deaths, considerable chaos and some farce: Noriega eventually surrendered from his refuge in the Vatican embassy after being deafened for days with rock music. A century after the United States created Panama to complete its canal, and a decade after the canal was given back to the Panamanians, Noriega stood trial in the U.S. In 2011, Panama's democratically elected president, Ricardo Martinelli, extradited him. He's still in prison. -- Paul Koring

With minimal combat training, the 1,975 soldiers were expected to merely garrison the British colony, which was guarded by 14,000 British, Indian and Chinese troops. But three weeks after the Canadians arrived, Japan sprung attacks on Pearl Harbor and across the South Pacific. The Japanese 38th Division stormed ashore on Hong Kong Island on the night of Dec. 18. Heavily outnumbered, with almost no naval or air support, the Canadians soon found themselves in hand-to-hand combat. Days later, 290 were dead - including some bayoneted as they lay in field hospital beds - and 493 were wounded. A further 267 would die as prisoners of war after the colony surrendered. -- Mark Hume

When they met, she was a widow with two children and a reputation as a licentious political mistress with expensive tastes. Six years his senior, curvaceous, with chestnut hair and hazel eyes, she had an engaging personality, though she rarely smiled because her teeth were rotten. Despite her infidelities and spendthrift ways, Napoleon adored Josephine and made her his empress. They only divorced because she hadn't given him a child and he wanted an heir. Even after his marriage to Marie-Louise of Austria, the couple remained close. All that came between them was her debts, Napoleon said later, and her name was on his lips as he lay dying in exile on St. Helena. -- Sandra Martin

Bush eked out a victory in the Electoral College thanks to a hotly contested result in the state of Florida. So began a maze of recounts and legal challenges, culminating in a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 12. The 5-4 decision in the case - Bush v. Gore - stopped the Florida recount. The next day, Mr. Gore conceded in a televised speech. ""While I strongly disagree with the court's decision, I accept it,"" he said. ""It's time for me to go."" -- Joanna Slater

He was held for six years and nine months, the longest of all the 92 foreign hostages in Lebanon in those years. ""I well remember - and shall never forget - the fear of being powerless in the hands of those who hate you,"" Anderson wrote. His joy at being released and reunited with family gave way a few years later to disappointment with his country. As a former prisoner, he was shaken by revelations of what transpired at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. ""When torture becomes entertainment, we're sick,"" he said. ""I think the U.S. has become less than it was."" -- Patrick Martin

Eventually tensions led to the trashing of a room at Montreal's Bonaventure Hotel, where, among other things, a TV suffered the cliché rock-and-roll fate of being tossed out a window. Band and crew - except singer Roger Daltrey, who had retired early - were led off to jail, where they had a merry time for a few hours. Later, guitarist Pete Townshend unconvincingly justified the band's brash interior redecorating, saying: ""I feel the same way towards hotels that our audience feels toward us - I'm kind of grateful that they're here, but I hate the prices they charge."" The episode was chronicled in bassist John Entwistle's song Cell Number Seven, and rock-star hedonism lore grew a little bit more. -- Brad Wheeler

Dubbed the Milwaukee Cannibal, Dahmer killed for the first time only weeks after graduating high school. He dissected his victim, beginning a gruesome pattern of dismemberment and necrophilia. Nine years passed before he killed again. Increasingly frequent murders followed, but one intended victim escaped and led police to an apartment littered with gruesome photos and at least four severed heads. Convicted in 1992, Dahmer was first held in solitary confinement, but asked to be moved to the general prison population. -- Paul Koring

By 1957, it had broken the record for longest run in the West End, previously held by Noel Coward's comedy Blithe Spirit. (Coward sent a telegram to Christie from Bermuda: ""Much as it pains me I really must congratulate you."") Sixty-one years later, the whodunnit remains unstoppable -- even though the Internet has tried. Critics have always been asked to keep the identity of the murderer secret -- and while they have generally obliged, Wikipedia has not. In 2010, Christie's grandson, who received the rights as a birthday present, complained about the online encyclopedia's spoilers, igniting an edit war that continues to this day. Regardless, the trap keeps ensnaring audiences worldwide. -- J. Kelly Nestruck

Then he sent the tape to CBS's 60 Minutes, which broadcast it in prime time. Kevorkian wanted to push the agenda on doctor-assisted suicide, and challenged authorities to charge him. ""The issue's got to be raised to the level where it is finally decided,"" he told journalist Mike Wallace. Prosecutors obliged him. Kevorkian was arrested, tried, and convicted of second-degree murder. Sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison, he was released in 2007. Four years later, he was dead.

Escalator fires were not uncommon in the Underground, often sparked by a cigarette butt or match. But this one was different. Sixteen minutes later, station inspectors heard a whoosh - the tell-tale sound of a flashover. In an instant, flames shot up the escalator shaft, licked the ceiling and spread. People screamed in terror as thick black smoke and searing heat engulfed the tunnels. Thirty-one people perished and many others were injured.

The charismatic leader of the Doukhobor empire in Western Canada was under attack from zealots. His own son had dismissed him as a reprobate, and the Russian government was seething because he'd broken ties with it. At 1 a.m. an explosion tore apart his rail car, killing Verigin, 65, his companion Mary Strelaeff, 20, and seven others. Parts of a time bomb were found in the wreckage. Among the suspects were two Doukhobors who'd placed luggage by his seat, an eccentric called the Czar of Heaven, who had foretold the leader's death, and a Russian watchmaker. Seven thousand attended the funeral, but the crime was never solved. -- Mark Hume

It seemed the entire country was tuning in to the late, great broadcaster Tom Cheek as the Jays first knocked off the Oakland A's - remember Roberto Alomar's homer off Dennis Eckersley? - and then, in Game 6 of the final against the Atlanta Braves, 41-year-old Dave Winfield struck a double in the 11th inning that gave the Jays a 4-3 victory.

At the foot of a hill, a memorial plaque lists the names of 116 children aged between 7 and 10, and 28 adults. This was once the site of a primary school and about 20 houses. On Oct. 21, 1966 - the last day before a half-term break - the children had just finished singing All Things Bright and Beautiful at a pre-holiday assembly when, with a roar, a 40,000-tonne pile of wet coal-mining waste slid down the hill and buried the school. The frenzied rescue efforts and public grief shocked British TV viewers, as did the town's fury at the public-sector coal industry - whose chairman refused to pay for the cleanup of the village. -- Doug Saunders

When Hair, billed as an ""American tribal love-rock musical,"" whooped and stripped its way onto the stage at the Public Theater in the East Village, New York Times critic Clive Barnes praised its shaggy charms, its music by Canadian expat Galt MacDermot, and its youthful, multiracial cast. But he noted that the show, with its free-love, anti-war call for revolution, was more of a happening than a satisfying narrative. When it opened on Broadway six months later, it had a new shape and a dozen new songs comprising a taxonomy of outré touchstones (hashish, the racial send-up Colored Spade). Uptown audiences were delirious. Still, as it ventured across the U.S., several communities were scandalized. Now? It's standard high-school fare. -- Simon Houpt

Born Margaretha Zelle in the Netherlands in 1876, she was known to the world as Mata Hari - exotic dancer, courtesan and, as history likes to record, seductress and spy. After a failed marriage to an abusive Dutch colonial army officer, she arrived penniless in Paris in 1903. She adopted her stage name, Indonesian for ""sun,"" and won renown as a dancer in a jewelled bra. Her travels across Europe and liaisons with German military officials as the First World War raged prompted France to accuse her of spying. After a trial in which the defence could not question its own witnesses, she was found guilty despite scant evidence. On the day of her execution, at age 41, 12 rifles were pointed at her. She blew a kiss at the men holding them. -- Dave McGinn

It arrived a month after the Nazis invaded Poland, warning Franklin Roosevelt that atomic physicists were close to turning uranium into a source of energy, which could lead to the creation of ""extremely powerful bombs of a new type."" Germany was already hoarding uranium from mines it controlled, Albert Einstein noted. Roosevelt immediately set up a committee to investigate the use of uranium - the initial step toward what would become the Manhattan Project. Six years later, Einstein's prophecy was complete. The world's first nuclear bomb was detonated in a test in the New Mexico desert. Weeks later, the U.S. used the new weapon in Japan. -- Joanna Slater

She moved into Graceland, without her parents, three years later, while still in high school. By the time Elvis's career surged again after his 1968 comeback special, they were married and had had Lisa Marie. But Elvis continued the lifestyle for which he had become famous - working hard, playing harder. He blamed travelling for his divorce - ""I was gone too much"" - but Priscilla saw it differently: ""I lived somebody else's life. It was never about me; it was really about him on every level."" If the marriage wasn't happy, the divorce was: The two remained close friends until Elvis's death in 1977. -- Noreen Rasbach

An obscure PLO affiliate, the Palestine Liberation Front, known for trying to infiltrate Israel by windsurfer, sailed for Haifa on the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro. Discovered on board, the team of four seized control of the vessel, ordered it to a Syrian port and demanded Israel release 50 Palestinian prisoners. Syria didn't let them land, and the group shot Mr. Klinghoffer, dumping him and his wheelchair overboard. PLO leader Yasser Arafat, recognizing a PR disaster, ordered the men to sail to Egypt and free the ship. They were to fly to a safe haven, but U.S. fighter jets forced their plane to land in Sicily, where they were tried for murder. -- Patrick Martin

Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, his successor, Lyndon Johnson, ordered an inquiry led by chief justice Earl Warren. The panel, which included future president Gerald Ford, reported back 10 months later and, in its 889-page bestseller, concluded that a lone shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, had felled the president. Despite subsequent investigations and the release of voluminous documents, conspiracy theories abound about a second gunman and a series of suspects including the Mafia, Cuban exiles, the CIA, even Johnson himself. Such theories were fuelled in part by the commission's failure to explore and refute them, and by the CIA's destruction of classified information about what Ford later called ""potentially damaging operations in danger of being exposed"" at the inquiry.  -- Sandra Martin

Lincoln Alexander, the son of a railway porter and a maid, was sworn in as Ontario's 24th lieutenant-governor at the age of 63. He had grown up in an era when blacks were denied the basic rights and opportunities enjoyed by whites, something he experienced first-hand when he could not get a sales job at Stelco - he was told customers would not want to deal with a black man. His appointment as the Queen's representative capped a distinguished career for the first black member of Parliament and the first black federal cabinet minister. ""I want to believe it served as a beacon of hope for the black community,"" Alexander wrote in his memoir. He died last year, his beacon still bright. -- Karen Howlett

His books, films and lectures delivered a ground-breaking message about the importance of protecting Canada's wilderness. He enthralled tens of thousands as he toured North America and Britain - once addressing the future Queen. The eloquent plea came with a commanding personality: He wore a fringed buckskin outfit, lived in a cabin with beavers and described himself as the son of an Apache woman and a Scottish guide. But there were many shades to Grey Owl. Immediately after his 1938 death, the North Bay Nugget exposed him as a bigamist with no native ancestry. Archibald Belaney was born in England, moved to Canada as a teen, learned trapping in an Ojibwa community and dyed his skin and hair. Still, admirers hoped the false front would not detract from his truths: ""You belong to nature, not it to you."" -- Joy Yokoyama

So revered in life that her name became synonymous with virtue, Mother Teresa was overshadowed in death by the accident that killed her friend Princess Diana just days earlier. Born in Macedonia in 1910, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu heard God's call at 12, took vows at 20 and went on to found a Catholic convent. She cared for the poor and dying in the slums of Calcutta, which earned her the Nobel Peace Prize and support for her beatification - a step toward sainthood. In later years, she was dogged by religious doubts and aspersions cast by the likes of Christopher Hitchens, who argued that given her opposition to abortion, contraception and painkillers, Mother Teresa was ''no friend to the poor.'' Nevertheless, the diminutive nun inspired generations of followers, many of whom can still be found ministering to the marginalized around the world. -- Genna Buck

But the 44-year-old Irwin's luck ran out in 2006, while diving near Australia's Great Barrier Reef, when a venomous bull stingray stung his chest - he was shooting a documentary, The Ocean's Deadliest. Irwin always figured he would die young, his wife, Terri, later said, but from a car accident, not an animal.

His brilliance on the baseball diamond put him in a class by himself, but one tragic event ahead of his debut with Detroit sheds some light on his spikes-up approach to the game and to life. On Aug. 8, 1905, Cobb's mother fired a shotgun at what she thought was an intruder outside her bedroom window in small-town Georgia. Instead, it was Cobb's father who was shot dead, after he told his wife he'd be away all night. Ty never got over it, and channelled his rage into his fierce style of play. The inaptly nicknamed Georgia Peach (nothing sweet about him) went on to win 12 American League batting titles, post a career average of .367 and set multiple records. In 1936, he received the most votes of anybody elected to the first-ever class of the Baseball Hall of Fame. -- Mason Wright

Earlier in the year, two towering figures had been assassinated: civil-rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy, who was campaigning to become the Democratic nominee for president. By the time the convention took place, 10,000 anti-war protesters had gathered in Chicago, where they encountered more than 17,000 police officers and members of the national guard. The worst moments came on Aug. 28, in what was dubbed the Battle of Michigan Avenue: a full-on riot, where, amid thick clouds of tear gas, police beat protesters and bystanders alike. It was not until 1996 that the Democratic Party returned to the city for a nominating convention, trying to put ghosts to rest. -- Joanna Slater

A 50-pound, radio-controlled bomb planted the night before blew up the boat, killing Mountbatten and three others. The Provisional Irish Republican Army took responsibility, saying the blast highlighted the British occupation of Northern Ireland. At Mountbatten's state funeral, military contingents from Canada, India, Burma, France and the United States were part of the procession. -- Anna Maxymiw

But the $25 pledge, imagined as Alberta's homegrown economic stimulus, proved tricky. The province did not have the money and Aberhart could not get control of the banks. But the popularity of the evangelist, galvanized by the following for his radio broadcasts, trumped questionable economic theory. ""Bible Bill"" died in 1943, still in the premier's chair.

He was born William Smith but changed his name in 1854 to Amor de Cosmos -- lover of the universe. A photographer who took portraits of miners, he moved to Victoria after gold was discovered on the Fraser River and started a newspaper, the British Colonist, which became a soapbox for his political views. Passionately advocating for the union of the two colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, he entered politics in 1863, holding federal and provincial seats before serving as premier from 1872 to 1874. He was afraid of electricity and known for his emotional outbursts, which included crying jags during speeches. An early embodiment of the eccentric world of B.C. politics, de Cosmos was declared of ""unsound mind"" in 1895. Two years later, he died alone and largely forgotten. -- Mark Hume

The offensive was short-lived: Despite outnumbering the region's British defenders by nearly two to one, Brigadier-General William Hull retreated to Fort Detroit as natives led by Chief Tecumseh harried his supply lines. British Major-General Isaac Brock seized the opportunity. What he lacked in troops, he made up for in cunning. Brock exaggerated the size and strength of the aboriginal force in letters he allowed to fall into Hull's hands. He dressed the Canadian militiamen in the distinctive uniforms of British regulars and paraded them before the fort's defenders. Unnerved, Hull raised the white flag. Brock had defeated a superior force without losing a man -- and proved Canada would not fall without a fight. -- Joel Eastwood

In front of an ivory box, he was a jazz virtuoso, with a swinging method that was meticulous, but perhaps too dazzling for some. One critic was Miles Davis, the cool-blue trumpeter who took issue with what he saw as a derivative style. Grammy awarders disagreed with Davis on eight occasions, however, and jazz critic Gene Lees endorsed Peterson as ""a summational artist."" He died, at age 82, in 2007.

Named for its discoverer, American Sue Hendrickson, the skeleton was auctioned off in 1997 for $7.6-million to Chicago's field museum -- ensuring that Sue was destined for scientific research and public display. Studies of the 90-per-cent preserved skeleton have helped cement the evolutionary link between theropod dinosaurs and modern birds, in part because Sue was the first T. rex found with a furcula -- a wishbone. Despite its name, Sue's gender remains in dispute. Less ambiguous are the signs of arthritis and multiple injuries that suggest life atop the food chain during the Cretaceous period was no picnic. -- Ivan Semeniuk

But funds dried up, he skipped town and decades later the hole proved a handy repository for chemical waste.

Pregnant women and young children were evacuated and after the government declared a health emergency, hundreds of families fled. They left behind a model ghost town.

He had just finished watching a movie about a doomed gangster when he walked into a deadly trap. Federal agents gunned him down outside Chicago's Biograph Theater as his companions -- madam Anna Sage, labelled ""the Lady in red"" despite her orange skirt, and moll Polly Hamilton -- fled. It was a violent finale to a year-long run in which the Jackrabbit, known for hopping over teller counters, held up about a dozen banks, raided police arsenals and escaped jail twice. Craving the $25,000 reward and wanting to avoid deportation, Sage set off the theatre stakeout, but only got $5,000 and a one-way ticket to Romania. On display at the morgue, Dillinger's body drew 15,000 gawkers. -- Joy Yokoyama

On a much longer drive, they may even learn to draw the Mona Lisa. Insist that no, it is not the worst toy ever made, it is in fact one of the best, because it demonstrates that with great limitation comes great freedom. Show them the magic of shake and erase.

Waldheim was one of the most respected people in the world, having served as Secretary-General of the United Nations for nearly a decade. During his campaign, people began to notice that his bestselling memoir, In the Eye of the Storm, had missed a few details, notably that he had been an active officer in the Nazi Wehrmacht when it was transporting the Jewish population of Southern Europe to death camps. The world reacted with outrage, but he still won the election in an Austria that was then unwilling to confront its Nazi past. His presidency was effectively boycotted by Western leaders. Waldheim denied participating in the atrocities, but in a letter published in German after his death in 2007, he regretted not speaking out more forcefully against the Nazi regime.

Today, the body of Williams - once the hottest of hitters - is preserved in cold storage in Arizona at -321F.

Jefferson, a genteel libertarian, and Adams, a conservative from farming stock, forged a friendship in the summer of 1776 and, eventually, a country, with the drafting of the Declaration of Independence. When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, their friendship did too. Adams accused Jefferson of atheism; Jefferson claimed Adams wanted to be king. They made peace a decade later, starting a 15-year correspondence that ended the day both died -- the 50th anniversary of the document that brought them together.

By then the country had tried out several English versions -- ""O Canada! Our fathers' land of old"" lost out -- and though Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier's original French version remains unchanged, most of the current English lyrics were penned in 1908 by Robert Stanley Weir, a judge. By the 1920s, O Canada was played in schools alongside God Save the King; in 1967, a parliamentary committee recommended it be played ""With dignity, not too slowly."" But it took the National Anthem Act of 1980 to ensure that future generations of Canadians, from restless school children to triumphant athletes, would stand to attention for Lavalee's tune.

But Tyson fell behind on points early, and in the third round, he bit Holyfield twice, tearing a chunk off of his opponent's ear. The fight had to be halted, and in ensuing days, endless replays of the savage act -- some say Tyson did it to be disqualified rather than suffer an embarrassing loss -- sucker-punched an already staggering sport.

His staunch federalist views had not endeared him to Quebec nationalists. That night, protesters and police clashed in Lafontaine Park. As rocks and bottles landed near him, Trudeau famously refused to take shelter. Police arrested 290 people in what became known as the Lundi de la matraque (Trucheon Monday). A Globe and Mail reporter at the scene saw demonstrators being dragged away by the hair and children being injured. The next day, his tough-guy reputation cemented, Trudeau won a parliamentary majority. The following year's event was also marked by violence, so no official parade was held in Montreal for the next two decades.

It was the journey of a lifetime and a turning point for the U.S. space program. She was the third woman to go into space, but thanks to a U.S.-centred media culture that had finally caught up to the idea, her mission carried far more resonance than those of her Russian predecessors. With a PhD in physics from Stanford University, Ride became an inspiration to young women the world over who dreamed of ""reaching for the stars"" -- her signature statement. That she was the first -- and only -- known gay astronaut emerged only after her death in 2012, a sign that social realities often lag light years behind technological achievement.

A beautiful widow working as a seamstress in Philadelphia had received a visit from General George Washington. He had a patriotic task for her: putting needle to thread to fabric to produce the first flag of a new nation. The story turned Betsy Ross -- the eighth of 17 children born to a Quaker family -- into an American icon. But there's no documentary evidence supporting the tale. The account is rooted in a lecture that Ross's grandson gave to a historical society in 1870, nearly a hundred years after the Stars and Stripes became the official flag of the new republic. In a young country hungry for heroes, the story grew into a legend; the Betsy Ross house still draws tourists. As U.S. president Woodrow Wilson once reportedly remarked when asked about the tale: ""Would that it were true.""

As she lay asleep in her bed, she was awakened by a cold knife at her neck and the threat of a homeless street preacher who had sliced through a window screen: ""Don't make a sound. Get out of bed and come with me, or I will kill you and your family."" Brian Mitchell then led the 14-year-old to the foothills near her house in Salt Lake City, where he took her as a second wife and raped her. Nine months later, sharp-eyed motorists spotted the veiled teen with Mitchell and his other wife, Wanda Barzee, in a Salt Lake suburb. After initially lying to police, the girl was finally reunited with her family. Now married and working as a motivational speaker and children's advocate, Elizabeth Smart has written a memoir, to be released in the fall. Her captors are in prison.

Like the Wright brothers' Flyer, Henry Ford's Quadricycle was the first step in an industrial journey that would change the world. It took Ford nearly two years to build his primitive car in a shed behind his Detroit home. The Quadricycle rode on skinny bicycle wheels, made four horsepower, had a top speed of 32 km/h -- and broke down on its maiden voyage through the streets. But before long, Ford would create the Model T and the biggest factory ever built -- the Rouge River complex churned out a car every three minutes. His mechanical mission would sweep aside the world he had known: The buggy whip, the family farm and the dirt road were on their way out, to be replaced by suburbs, superhighways and the age of mass consumption.

The Breton sea captain from Saint-Malo, France, had set sail 20 days earlier with two small ships and a crew of 61 men to explore the ""new lands,"" hoping to find gold and other riches. He had been commissioned by the King of France, and had a reputation for being capable and courageous. This would be the first of three voyages to North America for the French explorer, who became the first European to map the Gulf of St. Lawrence and sailed up the river as well. Cartier is not only credited with claiming Canada for France, but with giving this country its name after hearing natives use the word ""kanata,"" meaning town or village.

Yet Steve Nash was a sublimely skilled dribbler, passer, pick-and-roll wizard and three-point marksman. He also helped drive the Phoenix Suns to their first conference final in more than a decade in 1985. When he won the award a second time the following year, the once-overlooked kid from Victoria cemented his status as one of the greatest point guards ever.

Métis commander Gabriel Dumont, with just 200 men, used the natural trap of the river to ambush 800 Canadian soldiers under Major-General Frederick Middleton, forcing them to retreat. The victory was short-lived, however. More than two weeks later, the rebellion ended in a bloodbath at Batoche. Dumont escaped but Riel surrendered and was hanged.

An American F-16 pilot and his wingman wrongly assumed that a scheduled Canadian Forces anti-tank exercise near Kandahar was an enemy attack. Although told to hold fire, Major Harry Schmidt dropped a laser-guided bomb that killed privates Richard Green and Nathan Smith, Corporal Ainsworth Dyer and Sergeant Marc Leger, and wounded eight others from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Both Americans were disciplined, but charges were dropped.

April 12, 1945: Franklin Delano Roosevelt dies

When Franklin Roosevelt arrived at his retreat in the hills of Georgia in the spring of 1945, his health was already fragile. The world, meanwhile, was on the verge of momentous change: The war in Europe was nearly over, plans were underway for a final assault on Japan and the founding conference of the United Nations was weeks away. Roosevelt, just 63 and starting an unprecedented fourth term as president, would not live to see any of it. While sitting for a portrait, he complained of a sharp pain in his head – a massive cerebral hemorrhage – and died shortly after. As a shocked nation prepared to grieve, Vice-President Harry Truman approached Eleanor Roosevelt and asked what he could do for the family. She famously replied: ""Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10151512006858904/?type=3,2013-04-12 05:00:01,92,10,45,92,0,0,0,0,0

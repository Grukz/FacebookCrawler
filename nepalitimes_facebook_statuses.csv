Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is under mounting pressure to announce a date for local elections, but so far he has only promised a date on which he will announce the date: 19 Feburary.

Sunday is the Election Commission's deadline for polls to be held in two phases on 15 May and 4 June. But voting will only be possible if constitutional amendments are first passed.

Many suspect Dahal is hoping to stay on as PM if he can keep putting off elections. NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba is getting suspicious that Dahal wants to cling on to office despite their agreement to swap the post.

Dahal's spokesperson Pampha Bhusal told Nepali Times: ""It will be difficult to hold elections without first deciding on local bodies and the amendment.""

Parliament needs to pass three more bills, and if that is done by the weekend local elections can finally be held for the first time in 20 years.

Dangerous new highrises are springing up even before ruins of buildings that collapsed in the April 2015 earthquake are cleared, despite warnings of more catastrophic disasters in Nepal.

The country marks National Earthquake Safety Day on 15 January with a focus on preparing for the really Big One. Geological evidence of a massive earthquake 800 years ago that uplifted terrain by more than 10m was discovered recently south of Kathmandu. Enough tectonic energy has accumulated since then for another magnitude 8 earthquake, scientists warn.

""If we fail to prepare for the next Big One, there will be much more damage than we suffered in 2015,"" says Bijay Krishna Upadhyay of the National Society for Earthquake Technology.

If 2016 began amidst a border blockade, 2017 has started with a blockade of parliament. One month after the bill was tabled for the controversial second amendment to the Constitution, the House remains blocked and elections are still uncertain.

After the Supreme Court refused to issue an interim order against the amendment bill this week, the NC-Maoist ruling coalition is preparing to debate it in Parliament early next week. Its hope is that the opposition UML will come around. The Madhesi Front has decided to vote for the bill with a note of dissent, and the Federal Alliance may also support it.

January: The Indian Blockade was into its fourth month at the start of 2016, and Nepalis were still reeling under crippling shortages of fuel, medicines and essential commodities.
 
February: The Blockade was finally lifted, and Prime Minister KP Oli made a symbolic visit to India.
 
March: Oli visited Beijing and signed a historic trade and transit treat with China to reduce landlocked Nepal's dependence on India.

Despite the doom and gloom and the chronic cynicism of Kathmandu, there are many who are quietly building a better Nepal. You don't hear much about them in the media because they shun the public glare. In this edition of Nepali Times we profile a small sample of individual Nepalis who have shown through dedication and determination that it is possible to build a better future for this country.

There is a young woman who decided to leave an academic career in the United States, and returned home to Nepal to serve through politics. A Muslim woman from Nepalganj refuses to be a token human rights activist. A public interest litigation lawyer gave up his passion for singing to pursue the corrupt. A honest policeman cleaned up football and restored respect to Nepal's national team. A journalist who struggled against a male-dominated profession and patriarchy to reform the Election Commission.

There are many more Nepalis across the length and breadth of this land for whom the common denominator is the quiet satisfaction of knowing that they have given all they can to their communities and their nation.

What a difference one man makes.

On Thursday, Narendra Adhikari (pictured) was at the same spot, but didn't have much to do since there is no more power to cut.

Kulman Ghising has become a celebrity overnight for removing load-shedding in Kathmandu Valley, and the question in everyone's lips is: will there be electricity rationing this winter?

As protests over the Second Amendment to the Constitution continued for a second consecutive day on Thursday, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal tried to persuade Madhesi leaders to go along and prepare for local elections. 

Madhesi leaders not only rejected Dahal's proposal but also threatened to disrupt elections if the bill was pushed through without their consent. The Maoist-NC coalition will fail to secure a two-thirds majority to pass the bill without the Madhesi support. The main opposition UML has been even more vocal in cricitising the bill, disrupting House proceedings on Thursday and also carrying out protests, particularly in west Nepal. 

The Tarai Madhes Democratic Party (TMPD) leader Laxman Lal Karna said that inserting Sunsari, Morang, Jhapa in the east and Kailali and Kanchanpur in Far West into Tarai-only provinces is still his party's bottomline. ""Until we get these districts, we will not go for elections,"" he told Nepali Times on Thursday. 

Dahal is still hoping that Madhesi parties will eventually support the bill, probably after a few corrections in its content. If he wins over Madhesi support, the newly unified RPP and other fringe parties could also come on board, enabling the Maoist-NC coalition to secure a two-thirds majority.

A profusely garlanded Prime Minister Dahal toured Bhojpur on Tuesday, which was damaged in a fire. The scene was heavy on symbolism: destroyed homes, heavy security, hollow promises of help from the leadership and citizens as spectators.

Second-time prime minister Dahal is in a tight spot once again as the country marks the tenth anniversary of the peace accord this week. He is preparing to table the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution in Parliament in the next few days, but no one seems to be on his side.

Harindar Mahato of Birganj was preparing to take his wife to Madhubani in India for medical treatment last week. He had saved up INR 10,000 – all in high denomination 500 and 1,000 notes.

But on 8 November, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the surprise announcement to ban those notes saying India needed to weed out black money and counterfeit currency. Just like tens of millions of Indian families, Mahato's hard-earned money suddenly became worthless.

A week after the 157 UML-Maoist MPs filed an impeachment motion against the CIAA Chief Lokman Singh Karki, the NC is still dilly-dallying. The motion will not go through without its vote, so the NC is bargaining hard to name Karki's successor. There has also been intense behind-the-scenes diplomatic lobbying to seek a 'package deal' on impeachment that will include an agreement on contentious amendments to the constitution.

Parliament has gone into recess ostensibly for Tihar and Chhath festivals and also because of Indian President Pranab Mukherjee's three-day Nepal visit that will begin in Janakpur on 2 November. The choice of Janakpur is significant because of Nepal's refusal to allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit the holy town last year during the SAARC summit. Bilateral relations that soured after that worsened during the five-month Indian blockade.

Working swiftly and in top secrecy while Lokman Singh Karki of the anti-corruption agency, the CIAA, was enroute from Abu Dhabi, the UML and the Maoist Centre got 157 MPs to register an impeachment motion in Parliament on Wednesday evening. The move had a tacit nod from the Nepali Congress' Sher Bahadur Deuba. The leaders didn't suddenly get pangs of conscience, they had information Karki was preparing to file court cases against top politicians.

Karki is now suspended from his post, but a two-thirds majority of 397 is required for his impeachment. Several senior NC leaders held out against impeachment at the Central Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon in Sanepa. However, NC's Gagan Thapa and Dhana Raj Gurung want the party to endorse the motion.

Some NC leaders are worried that not joining the impeachment vote will have electoral reper-cussions. Karki's impeachment issue could therefore have wider ramifications on national politics.

No Dasain is complete without the mandatory mutton meal, and it seems this appetite will not be dampened even in the aftermath of earthquakes and blockades. Three-quarters of Nepal's goat consumption during this festival season is met by imports from India, sheep and mountain goats from Tibet make up to 25 per cent, the rest are goats from Nepal. 

Meat consumption didn't go down by much even in last year's Dasain which happened right in the middle of the Indian blockade. And the closure
of the earthquake-damaged Kodari Highway to China hasn't stopped the import of ungulates from Tibet. 

Nepal's per capita consumption of meat is 10 kg, higher than India which is 5kg person per year, but much lower than the United States which consumes 120 kg per capita. Goat meat accounts for only a quarter of all meat consumed in Nepal.

Most of the 2 million earthquake survivors who lost their homes are still waiting for government grants to rebuild, but those who have received the first tranche of cash are spending it on Dasain shopping.

Most say the grant, which has been increased to Rs 300,000, will not be enough to restore their homes anyway, so they are using the first installment of Rs 50,000 to repay debt and for household expenses. 

They are also tired of waiting for politicians in Kathmandu to get their act together. There may be even more delays because Prime Minister Dahal is expected to replace the head of the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA), Sushil Gyewali, with a party apparatchik. Gyewali himself was a political appointee of Prime Minister Oli, and replaced Govind Raj Pokharel, who was a Congress candidate.

A decade after the end of the conflict in Nepal, the perpetrators of war crimes want to bury the truth while the families of victims are still trying to dig it out.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal commanded the Maoist militia and is charged with wartime excesses. His coalition partner Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress used to be prime minister for most of the war years and allowed human rights violations.

Neither Dahal and Deuba now want to rake up the past. The former enemies have ensured that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission for the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) have weak mandates.

If it wasn't for a Supreme Court verdict, there would probably have been a law by now granting blanket amnesty and pardons for war crimes.

In September 2008, the theme of every speech that 
Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal made during his first official visit to India after being elected was: ""Trust me."" The message is the same during his second state visit this week as well.

Eight years ago, Dahal was given a rousing welcome in New Delhi despite having miffed some quarters by visiting China first. Everyone wanted to shake the hand of the man who had gone from being a guerrilla commander to an elected Prime Minister. The Indian media couldn't get enough of him.

However, there was some skepticism of his commitment to parliamentary democracy and free market. Dahal tried hard to convince Indian investors that he was a man they could do business with. But it was his step-by-step attempt to grab absolute power when he returned that soured his relations with India and ultimately led to his resignation in 2009.

It has taken him eight years to be accepted enough to make another visit to New Delhi, and regain that displaced trust. In the next few days,Dahal will be trying to convince India's top leaders that he has learnt his lessons, and will not dabble in political adventurism.

86321293410_10154101525778411,"IN THE DRIVING SEAT

Nepal's festival season starts this weekend with Tij, the day devoted to women that they themselves are ambivalent about. Most Nepali women will fast, visit Pashupati, take a holy dip, and don red and green to wash away sins and for the longevity of husbands. Others regard Tij as a practice that perpetuates female subservience and fatalism. 

But Tij is also a festival of solidarity and sisterhood, and has emerged lately as a day of defiance. If the lyrics of this year's traditional Tij duets are any indication, women are saying enough is enough, and want an end to existing inequalities within the home, at work, and in state structures.

Despite constitutional provisions for one-third female representation in all sectors of government, the number of women ministers in the current cabinet is only three out of 31.

As he returned home on 25 July, cab driver Chitra Bahadur Khatri knew that the Biplav faction of the Maoist party had called a strike that day. But it was only 3:45 am and he thought he was still safe.

Five men stopped his Maruti in New Baneswor and lobbed a petrol bomb into it while he was still inside. He scrambled out, but the blaze reduced his taxi to cinders.

After weeks of effort, Nepali Times finally brought Khatri face-to-face with the arsonists police say set fire to his taxi that fateful morning. Khatri, 19, looked nervous as he entered the office of the All Nepal Communications, Printing and Publications Workers' Union (Revolutionary) in New Baneswor, which is affiliated with the [hardline Biplav Maoists](hardline Biplav Maoists).

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has deployed his two deputies on twin errands to the north and south to forge equidistance between Nepal's two big neighbours. But his diplomatic dealings are fraught with uncertainty, and could further strain Kathmandu's relations with New Delhi and Beijing.
A day before Deputy PM and Finance Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara's return from Beijing, Deputy PM and Home Minister Bimalendra Nidhi jetted off to New Delhi on Thursday. While Mahara was in Beijing to invite Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit Kathmandu, Nidhi is inviting Indian President Pranab Mukherjee to do the same.   
Dahal is only too aware — from his first tenure in 2008 — that playing India off against China comes at a political cost. This time, he is trying to be more careful, but foreign affairs experts say the strategy may be a liability.

We trace the tragedies that struck their lives, the trauma of bereavement, and the healing process as families affected by both sides come together to seek truth and justice.

We will revisit the stories of Purnimaya Lama and Devi Sunar (pictured), both from Kavre. Purnimaya's husband, Arjun, was abducted, tortured and killed by the Maoists in 2005. Devi's daughter, Maina, was 14 when she was raped and killed by soldiers in 2004. 

More than a decade later, Purnimaya and Devi have joined hands to pursue justice for their loved ones, who had been killed by opposing sides.

Taking his oath of office as Nepal's 39th prime minister for the second time on Thursday, Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal refused to swear in the name of God.

He does not have the same charisma and swagger he demonstrated in 2008, when he went from being a guerrilla commander to a prime minister elected in a landslide victory. In the last ten years since the end of the conflict, he has been trying to remake himself as a pragmatic politician, but has come across as a flip-flopper.

This time, Dahal has only nine months to show that he is a leader to be reckoned with in future elections, as he has to give up his position to Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress next year. It will be an uneasy alliance with the NC, and Dahal will also have to get the economy back on its feet after the devastation of the earthquake and the Indian Blockade.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal: The fact that someone whose position fell to #3 in the 2013 polls is set to become prime minister for the second time is Nepali politics in a nutshell. The CPN (Maoist-Centre) Chair has played deft kingmaker, carving out a political space for himself between the NC and the UML, and mending bridges with New Delhi. But Dahal's time is limited, as he must step down in nine months to make way for the NC's Sher Bahadur Deuba.

In a party meeting on Wednesday, he said: ""This is my last chance."" Dahal has his eye on the three elections next year, and he wants to tinker with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act.

Today, Kathmandu Valley's southern suburbs have crept up the far side of the river to Bhaisepati and beyond.

Many lament the end of an era when Kathmandu was still an emerald Valley of paddy terraces dotted with ancient towns of russet tile and brick. 

However, the chariot festival is living proof that culture, far from being fragile, is vibrant and evolving. When the earthquake struck last year, the red rain god had just been taken out of the temple in Bungamati and placed in the chariot for the festival. The temple was destroyed, but the god survived, the damaged chariot was rebuilt and continued on its journey. When the deity returns to Bungamati this month after Nepal's first female president pays her respects at Bhoto Jatra, the god will go into a tin shed just like Bungamati's hundreds of other quake survivors still living in temporary shelters.

From this issue, Nepali Times starts a fortnightly column Heritage Live! looking at the renewed sense of ownership and pride with which Nepalis regard their living heritage.

86321293410_10153935511308411,"The capital is suddenly agog again with talk of a new government to replace the current coalition led by Prime Minister Oli. Two months after Oli deftly defused a NC-Maoist attempt to dislodge him, the grumbling is getting louder again. What is focusing everyone's attention is December 2017 — by when there are supposed to be three elections. Letting the UML use the nationalism card, spend on populist projects under the new budget, and have the incumbent advantage in campaigning would make Oli stronger, they feel.

The NC's Sher Bahadur Deuba, under pressure from his own party, wants to be prime minister for the fourth time by replacing Oli. If that cannot be achieved, he is willing to let Pushpa Kamal Dahal lead a coalition that will include the NC. 

Dahal, who postponed his Australia trip last week because of fear of arrest for wartime atrocities, is worried about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. By being prime minister, he feels he can gain immunity from prosecution. The likes of Ram Bahadur Thapa — who recently returned to the mother party — and Narayan Kaji Shrestha are also in a hurry to throw Oli out.

Shrestha told us: ""Neither the NC nor the UML is in a position to form a unity government, so our party has a chance. If that does not happen, we are open to forming a new government with the NC, and the Madhesis.""

But Deuba still feels betrayed, and does not think Dahal could be a reliable partner in a new coalition. Gyanendra Karki, one of Deuba's confidantes, said: ""Let the Maoists pull out first, then we will think of a possible coalition with them.""

Kamal Thapa of the RPP-N appears to be already on the campaign trail, speaking at rallies supporting the restoration of a Hindu state, and hoping that this will be seen favourably by the Narendra Modi government in India. 

Meanwhile, the Madhesi parties are trying (not so successfully) to maintain their movement's momentum. They need a safe landing, which will only happen with Oli's departure. If the current situation continues, the fractious Madhesi Front will see its power base in the Tarai eroded by radicals as well as mainstream parties — especially the RPP-N with its Hindu agenda. At stake is the enormous vote bank representing the 5 million people of Province 2 of the eastern Tarai.

Many Nepalis probably do not even know that Nepal has a Department of Railways. Set up a few years ago, it is now coming up to be an important government agency charged with surveying the alignment of the proposed East-West Railway and two cross-border railway lines linking Biratnagar and Janakpur to India. 

After years of inaction, the imminent arrival of the Qinghai-Xigatse railway to Kerung on the Nepal-Tibet border by 2020, and the dispatch of the first container train with Nepal-bound cargo from Lanzhou to Kerung last month, seem to have stirred everyone into action. The Indians, in particular, appear to be keen to revive the railway projects they want to be involved with, including the East-West Railway.

The Chinese decision to make Kerung the new trans-Himalayan gateway instead of Kodari appears to be linked to Rasuwa Gadi having a gentler gradient for track-laying. After the earthquake and Indian blockade, the Kerung-Rasuwa Gadi border is bustling. The Nepal government is expediting infrastructure on the Nepal side so it will be ready when the train arrives in four years.

The government is widening the Galchhi-Rasuwa Gadi Highway and building a multi-storey border office and dry port in Rasuwa. It is hoped that the road will ultimately pave the way for a railway corridor between India and China through Nepal. During his visit to Beijing in March, Prime Minister KP Oli urged China to help build a rail network. The China Railway Construction Corporation has approached the Nepal government to carry out a feasibility study for a train to link Rasuwa Gadi with Kathmandu, Pokhara and Lumbini, for which the Finance Minister announced a feasibility study in his budget speech last month. 

Mohan Basnet of the Inter-Modal Transport Development Board said: ""The Rasuwa Gadi customs office, dry port, rail and all other projects are being built with a view that Nepal can be a trade transit point between India and China in future.""

Meanwhile, the Biratnagar and Janakpur rail projects will be the first of several cross-border train links at Kakadvitta, Bhairawa and Nepalganj to the Indian railway network. Rajeswar Man Singh of the Department of Railways told us: ""The project was delayed by the blockade, but we have now begun building the railway embankments."" 

After a prolonged debate over whether the East-West railway should be built through Chitwan National Park, the Department has finally settled on an alternative route that would circumvent the sanctuary.

Bishal Shivakoti had assisted his wounded aunt, Sabitri, and also helped get four others — whom he had rescued from the rubble of collapsed buildings — into the helicopter just before it flew out at 3pm. Later, Bishal heard on the radio that an American helicopter was missing, but there were several rescue flights that day, and he did not think it was the one with his aunt in it. 

The wreckage of the helicopter was found three days later at 3,300m. It had struck the mountain in cloud five minutes after take-off. The 13 bodies had to be identified using DNA tissue samples. Rescuers also found a camera at the crash site. It belonged to Marine photographer Sara A Medina, 23. 

They downloaded the photographs Medina had shot of the rescue in Singati. The final image is that of a group of people  looking shocked and anxious, and among them (standing at left, above) is Bishal. He is wearing a 'I Love Nepal' t-shirt, hands and feet covered in dust from digging people out of buildings that had collapsed.  

One year later in Singati, when Bishal was shown this picture he recognised himself, his neighbours and relatives. When told the photograph was the last one taken by an American who died in the crash, Bishal clutched his hair with both hands, took a long breath with his head down, and said, ""Oh my god."" 

When he looked up, he had tears in his eyes.

Sanjay Sada had become the first Musahar in his village to pass the SLC exams. Although it is the home district of Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokhrel, the literacy rate here — as in other eastern Tarai districts — is 46 per cent, much lower than the national average of 65 per cent.  

All schools were closed for six months last year during the Madhes agitation. When the exams were finally held, many nervous students fainted. ""They were under pressure because they hadn't finished preparations,"" said Dipak Shakya, Principal of Birganj Public College.  

Madhesi parties are now focusing their agitation in Kathmandu, but students face a shortage of textbooks in the minister's own district. Ministry of Education's Hari Lamsal's response is emblematic of the government's buck-passing: ""We are embarrassed, but what can we do if the state agency supposed to print textbooks does not finish in time?""

In the Tarai districts with low literacy rates, teachers, students and their parents were expecting a special education program, particularly after last year's disruptive Tarai agitation. But the government failed to fulfil these aspirations. Instead, Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel last week allocated merely 11 per cent of the budget for education.

Sunita Mahara is a 35-year-old Dalit woman from Dhanusa and has been at the forefront of all protest rallies organised by the Federal Alliance in Kathmandu this week.
On Tuesday Mahara (pictured) was injured as riot police clashed with Madhesi and Janajati protesters. But the very next day, with her right elbow bandaged, she was back at a rally at Ratna Park. When Abhas Labh belted out the parody song that has become the anthem of the protests, Mahara had tears streaming down her eyes.
""The hill dwellers have always looked down at us as outsiders,"" she told us in Hindi. ""We are here to tell them that we are also Nepalis."" Three people were killed by police in Dhanusa during last year's Madhes Movement.
Despite deep resentment among participants at the rallies, the protests led by figures from plains-based parties and indigenous groups have failed to gather momentum. Attendance has been dwindling and there are rifts within the Madhesi leadership. The government is hoping the protests will fizzle out, but even so, the Federal Alliance this week said it would continue the agitation in the capital for 10 more days.
After its six-month agitation in the Tarai backed by an Indian blockade failed to exert enough pressure on the NC, UML and Maoists to rewrite the Constitution, Madhesi parties found common cause with Janajatis even though the two have mutually contradictory demands. The Madhesis want the eastern most Tarai districts of Morang, Sunsari and Jhapa in their province, while the Janajatis insist they belong to their hill province. 
Urmila Devi Sah, an MP from Dhanusa, says the Federal Alliance was forged only after Janajati parties agreed to the Madhesi demand for two provinces in the plains that included the disputed districts. But Lila Nath Angdembe of the Federal Limbuwan State Council says: ""Without the three eastern plains districts, our province will be much poorer.""
The protests may not be powerful enough to force a rewrite of the Constitution, but it could destabilise the UML-Maoist coalition. Prime Minister K P Oli sweet talked the Maoists into giving up their bid to topple the government earlier this month, but if he does not step down after the budget, the Maoists could side with the NC and use the Madhes crisis to try to unseat him again.

86321293410_10153819749228411,"HOLLOW NATIONALISM: A week after surviving a 'coup' by the opposition Nepali Congress, a plot widely believed to have been hatched in New Delhi, Prime Minister K P Oli told diplomats in Kathmandu on Wednesday that his government is not in crisis, and will be replaced only when a new parliament is elected in 2018. 

This contradicts the assurance Oli apparently gave Maoist Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal that he would step down after the budget. This means not everything is hunky dory in the ruling coalition, and the NC is waiting for the right opportunity to strike again.
 
Dahal is under pressure from his party's ministers in government, and is not publicly pressing for regime change, but he faces counter pressures from other comrades who are not ministers to unseat Oli. The leaders of breakaway Maoist factions, who are finalising a deal with Dahal to rejoin the main party, also want a new government so they can claim a share.

Rajan Bhattarai, one of Oli's trusted aides, denied there was a secret deal last week to make Dahal PM. ""Dahal backed off not because Oli promised him prime ministership but because he realised it was not possible to forge a ruling coalition with the NC and Madhesi parties,"" he said.

To make things murkier, Maoist leader Janardan Sharma told us:  ""Forget the wording, the spirit of the very first line of the deal is to form a new government under our party's leadership."" 

New Delhi appears determined to break the communist coalition which it believes was masterminded by Beijing. Last week, former Indian ambassador KV Rajan is learnt to have secretly met UML leaders, including Madhav Nepal, to break the UML-Maoist partnership. Oli is convinced India wants him out, and in retaliation cancelled President Bidya Bhandari's visit to India, and  recalled Nepal's ambassador Deep Kumar Upadhyay.

This week's high drama for regime change appeares to have fizzled out as the UML beat the Nepali Congress in its competition to woo the UCPN(M). 

UML Vice-chairman Bam Dev Gautam went to meet Dahal at his home early Thursday morning and appears to have convinced him that Oli was ready to hand over the premiership to him if he waited till after the budget is presented on 28 May. Later, when a delegation from the NC went to meet Dahal the Maoist leader reportedly thanked them for their offer, but that he'd have to decline for now.

As the first anniversary of the 25 April earthquake approaches, Dil Bahadur Maharjan remembers the day with dread. How a neighbour's multi-storey house fell on top of his, completely destroying it. He also can't believe how quickly the past year has gone by – a year of hardships for his family of five crammed into a small room in the premises of a local school without water or electricity.

Maharjan is a security guard, and most of his meagre income goes to buying food and paying school fees for his two sons. One would expect someone in Maharjan's position to be full of bitterness and anger. But he counts his blessings, and says at least no one in his family was harmed.

Majhi is among 2.5 million Nepalis who will have to wait another rainy season, and perhaps even till next winter, in temporary shelters. A government distracted by street agitation, the blockade and political infighting is just not equipped to provide relief.

The National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) was to start distributing grant assistance of Rs 200,000 from Singati of Dolakha on 3 March, but was postponed. 

""Singati will be a pilot project. We will use lessons from it in earthquake affected areas in Dolakha and other districts,"" NRA head Sushil Gyewali said.

In the first phase 6,000 families will get the Rs 50,000  first installment transferred to their bank accounts. They get the second installment of Rs 80,000 after the house design is approved, and the final installment of Rs 70,000 after completion of the house.

But locals are skeptical. 

""We have heard all this before, and waited too long. Every time the deadline nears it is postponed,"" said Sundar Shrestha of the Dolakha Chamber of Commerce.

Some 1,300 families have opened bank accounts, but many say Rs 200,000 isn't enough. ""It won't even buy us the timber,"" says Shrestha. 

While survivors have given up hope on the government, Nepal's donors and relief agencies are getting increasingly impatient with the delays. They accuse the NRA of trying to control everything when it should be urgently facilitating reconstruction.

They get less coverage in the media, are treated with less respect and receive smaller paychecks than their male counterparts.

On the occasion of International Women's Day, Nepali Times caught up with a few female athletes who have done the nation proud in recent international tournaments.

A bright spot amidst Nepal's lacklustre performance in the 12th South Asian Games were the three gold medals, two of which were brought home by women. Sixteen-year-old wushu phenom Nima Gharti Magar (pictured) bagged the first gold for Nepal in the 12 day-long event.

Competing in her first international event, Magar resolutely stated that ""girls are not weaker than boys"" after clinching the gold, proving that girls are not inferior when it comes to physical tasks.  Magar considers herself lucky to have such a strong support system at home and at practice, and credits her family, seniors and coaches for her success. ""I never had to face any discrimination while training or performing in events,"" says Magar, who is competing in a field still dominated by men.

Still, Magar's friends who began training at the same time quit because of lack of support. Magar wants to encourage other girls who feel passionate about sports to pursue their dreams.

For now, the 10th grader is concentrating on her studies but says she will get back to training as soon as the exams are over.

Prime Minister KP Oli is on a six-day state visit to India from Friday with the same goal two weeks after the five-month 'unofficial' Indian blockade was officially lifted.

Despite the timing, the visit is going to be largely symbolic, a chance for both sides to mend fences, do some damage control and save face.

Two decades after the Maoists launched their war by attacking a police station at Holeri of Rolpa district on the night of 13 Feburary 1996, not much has changed in these rugged terraced hills.

The police station has been rebuilt, more young men are leaving for work, and the busiest part of Libang bazar is the IME office where families come to receive cash from migrant workers in the Gulf.

Twenty years after the start of the war and ten years after it ended, the people of Rolpa feel their lives have not improved. Many here in the cradle of the Maoist revolution still support the party's goals, but are disappointed that it has split and abandoned its egalitarian goals.

Most people interviewed by Nepali Times said the armed struggle was ideologically right but behaviourally wrong. Maoist cadres here think theirs is an unfinished revolution even though the party's main demands of abolition of the monarchy and writing a new constitution were met. 

""The conflict made it possible to establish a federal democratic republic, and made Nepali people aware of their rights,"" said Ganeshor KC, 50, a local health post worker. Throughout the conflict, KC fed and sheltered both the Maoists and the state security forces, like most people in his village.

""When I heard about the ceasefire in 2006, I was happy and thought with peace there would be development,"" he said.

But Madhesi leaders say the amendments do not go far enough, and they have continued their sit-in at no-man's land. However, cold and fatigue have taken their toll and the presence of the protesters is visibly reduced. 

Madhesi leaders also seem to be divided over whether to continue with the border obstruction, or to change their tactics. Mahendra Raya Yadav of the Madhesi Front appeared to sense that the public mood in the plains is changing and people are fed up with the disruptions. But hardline Madhesi leaders feel the blockade is working and it should continue until the Big Three in Kathmandu agree to re-demarcate provincial borders.  

The gulf between Madhesi leaders and the Madhesi public about the border obstruction seems to be widening. Till a month ago, most people on the streets of this border town that depends on trade with India would not speak out for fear of repercussion, particularly from Madhesi parties. But they are now so fed up, they are more than willing to speak on camera.

86321293410_10153551194753411,"SAFE LANDING: Nepal's economy is on the verge of collapse, and infrastructure projects are on hold. 

Last week, the Norwegian company Statkraft pulled out of the 650MW Tama Kosi III project citing fragile political situation and lack of power sector reforms in the country. Had the $1.5 billion project been completed as scheduled this year, it would have bolstered Nepal's economy by exporting electricity to India. Statkraft's exit is a huge blow to the country's goal of becoming an energy exporter, and has also hurt the confidence of foreign investors interested in Nepal. 

Statkraft cited political instability and disruptions as reasons behind its decision, but several big foreign investment and development projects have been delayed by last April's earthquake and the Indian blockade.  

The long overdue Melamchi Water Supply Project is expected to be further delayed by a year. After nine months of disruption, work on the Ring Road expansion project supported by China  finally resumed this week. Several other national priority projects have also suffered setbacks, including an ADB-funded upgrades of Kathmandu Airport (pic) and a second international gateway serving Lumbini. 

""The 1989 blockade didn't stop work at the Marsyangdi project, that should have been the case this time too,"" says Bigyan Shrestha, project chief of the 456MW Upper Tama Kosi which has itself been delayed by at least two years. ""The government failed to come up with contingency plans to support ongoing infrastructure projects."" 

Since September 90 per cent of the industries in the Tarai have been shut down, causing an estimated loss of Rs 2 billion daily. Several five-star hotel projects in Kathmandu have also been delayed or shelved. In its review of 2015-16, the Central Bank has said Nepal's economy may be heading to negative growth this fiscal year.

86321293410_10153538062048411,"DEAL MAKING: After 150 days of unrest in the plains, four months of border blockade, and 25 rounds of failed talks, a deal between the Big Three parties and the Madhesi Front finally appears within reach. 

A meeting of the top three leaders on Thursday resolved to ink a deal with the Front next week, providing a face-saver for India to fully lift a blockade it never officially admitted to imposing. The Front has already backed down from its stance to withdraw protests only when federal boundaries are readjusted, apparently after New Delhi leaned on it. It is willing to agree to an all-party mechanism to redraw boundaries within a certain timeframe. 

But there is still disagreement over the legitimacy, jurisdiction and scope of the proposed all-party mechanism. The Front is now seeking a written commitment from the three parties that the mechanism will be mandated to readjust provincial boundaries. 

Rajendra Shrestha, a Federal Socialist Forum Nepal (FSPN) leader who represents the agitating side in the joint task-force formed to prepare the framework of a deal, told Nepali Times on Thursday: ""A deal is possible as and when the ruling parties assure us that the mechanism will create two identity-based provinces in the Tarai without breaking ethnic clusters."" 

The ruling UML-UCPN coalition and the main opposition NC are afraid that Madhesi leaders will gain the upper hand in future negotiations if they now promise to create two provinces encompassing the whole Tarai. They are ready to give legitimacy to the mechanism by getting it passed by Parliament or adding a clause about it in the constitution, but they rule out any commitment on the number of provinces in the plains or their boundaries. 

NC negotiator Mahesh Acharya proposed to ""reopen and revisit"" all issues after a joint taskforce meeting this week, while Deputy Prime Minister Bijaya Gachhadar, the only Madhesi leader in the UML-led government, rejected the demand for two Tarai provinces, arguing for a third for his Tharu community.

UML whip Gokul Prasad Gharti said the Madhesi parties were under pressure to show flexibility as India had agreed to begin customs clearance for Nepal-bound goods from Raxaul once a deal is reached. He told us: ""The Indian Prime Minister promised our Prime Minister during their telephone conversation that the blockade will be lifted when parliament passes the amendment.""

The three parties and the Madhesi Front are due to reach an agreement by Monday and Parliament is expected to convene on Tuesday, 19 January. Already there are signs of the blockade easing, as all Indian border checkpoints barring Birganj are now fully open. Even fuel tankers stranded in Raxaul are being rerouted through other checkpoints.

Hemanta Shahi, 34, died in Saudi Arabia in October but his body only just arrived home on a flight that afternoon. Ramita has been grieving for three months; she has no more tears left.

Hemanta's body, wrapped in holy yellow cloth, is placed on the pyre. His six-year-old son lights it. Ramita sits nearby for the two hours it takes for her husband's body to be reduced to ashes which are swept into the Bagmati. 

Nearly 87,000 Nepali migrant workers flew to Saudi Arabia in 2015 for work last year. Hemanta was among the 273 who died there. He travelled from his village in Salyan district to Dammam in Saudi Arabia in February. He wanted to earn enough to feed his family and educate his two children, who are enrolled in primary school back home. 

There are nearly 2 million Nepali migrant workers in the Gulf and Malaysia, and another 2 million seasonal migrants in India. Between July 2014–July 2015, 1002 of them died – most of them in Malaysia. More than half the deaths are due to what is called sudden unexpected death syndrome (SUDS). The workers go to sleep and never wake up. Health experts say the cause is overwork, stress, dehydration and poor diet. 

A breakdown of the deaths last year shows that most migrant workers in Malaysia and Qatar die of SUDS, while in Saudi Arabia it is mostly due to hit-and-run accidents on highways. Hemanta Shahi's supervisor told his family he died in his sleep, but a death certificate stuffed in the casket says he died in a road accident. Hemanta's family is lucky to have received his body, at least 70 bodies are waiting to be flown back to Nepal from Saudi Arabia alone.  

Hemanta's wife reached Salyan after the funeral on Thursday after 15 hours on a bus. Her husband died before paying the loan he took to go abroad, and the debt is now on her shoulders. She is Nepal's latest migration widow, her children the latest orphans.

86321293410_10153496738923411,"DIARY OF A BAD YEAR: From runway blockage to Indian blockade, it has been a horrible year. In March, the country's only international airport was closed for four days by an airliner obstructing the runway.

That happened at the beginning of spring, dislocating the tourism industry. And at the peak of the trekking season on 25 April central Nepal was shaken by a devastating earthquake that killed nearly 9,000 people.

Then came the political disaster in the aftermath of a fast-track constitution that set the Tarai on fire. The violence has killed more than 60 people since August, and ended up being a border blockade supported by
New Delhi.

As 2015 comes to a close there are slight stirrings of hope that Nepal, India and the agitating parties all need a safe landing. India needs to show that it wasn't imposing a blockade, the Madhesi parties are under pressure from hardliners in the field and the Nepal government is being blamed for not sorting this out earlier.

Nepal is reeling under a humanitarian disaster that is surprisingly being ignored by the rest of the world. Nepal's 28 million people are affected, but the plight of two million homeless earthquake survivors is much worse.

There is hope that 2016 will be better, but the impact of the blockade on Nepal's economy and development process will take much longer than that to heal.

On Sunday 20 September at 5PM CA Chair Subhas Nembang will endorse the document, President Ram Baran Yadav will promulgate it and hand it over to the Prime Minister Sushil Koirala. UML Chair K P Oli is expected to take over as prime minister after Koirala returns from the United Nations General Assembly next week. The CA will convert into parliament with a new speaker. A new President will be elected a month later. The new Constitution will be immediately tested by the ability of the new regime to address the demands of various Tarai-based groups.

-  1 million people require emergency food
-  800,000 homes destroyed and damaged
-  50,000 households have got no help at all

Even in accessible areas, many families haven't got the emergency cash grant of Rs 15,000 the government announced right after the quake. This raises questions about how support for housing reconstruction will be disbursed.  

There are also concerns about how much of the money pledged on Thursday will actually come to Nepal, and whether it will evaporate en route in contracts, consultancies and overheads for foreign agencies.

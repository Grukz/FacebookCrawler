5281959998_14025389998,"It was only a matter of time before technology took over the tee. Even though Global Positioning System units for golfers have been around since 2002, they weren't sanctioned by the United States Golf Association for tournaments, even for amateurs, until 2006. Since then sales of the portable devices — designed to let golfers know how many yards they're standing from the pin and what obstacles might be in the way — ""have exploded,"" said Bob Tucker, the purchasing manager for the Golf Warehouse, an online retailer.

""The latest GPSs are accurate to within three feet,"" said Brian Verdugo, president of L1 Technologies, the San Diego company that makes the iGolf Neo GPS unit. Battery drain was once a problem. In the early units, ""a charge would only last for four or five hours, barely enough for 18 holes,"" Mr. Verdugo said. Now players can expect a minimum of two rounds between charges. The newer generation of GPS units are also sleeker than the early models, which Mr. Verdugo likened to bricks.

Because only about 5 percent of golf courses have golf carts with the technology built in, GPS is mostly BYO. But it's a gadget that's probably more useful than a cart cooler.

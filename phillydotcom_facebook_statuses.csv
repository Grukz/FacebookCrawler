In his words: ""The object of these portraits is to get at the joy that each of these subjects felt at a certain point in their lives as African-Americans. Instead of me telling the subjects how I want them to pose or look at the camera, I start by telling them, ""We are going to have a conversation."" Then I begin talking to them about their lives and how the important moments of their lives have shaped who they are. When this happens all of the subjects open up and let me see, for a few moments, the happiness that dwells inside them.

It has been a privilege for me to spend time with these special people and my joy is they trusted me enough to open themselves up to me."" - Michael Bryant

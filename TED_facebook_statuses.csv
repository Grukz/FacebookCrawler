29092950651_10157862397430652,"Boost your leadership skills with these book recommendations from TED speaker and social scientist Arthur Brooks: 

#1: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius
 
Perspective might be the most underrated characteristic of strong leaders. As soon as someone begins to accumulate a little influence or build a reputation, it is tempting to quickly forget how small a place each of us really occupy in a massive world. The great Marcus Aurelius reminds us of this lesson over and over again in his Mediations. A deceptively short read, the classic Stoic text synthesizes a lifetime's worth of lessons into 12 crisp chapters.
 
#2: How to Win Friends and Influence People (Dale Carnegie)
 
How to Win Friends and Influence People was an instant classic when it was first published in 1936. It remains extremely well-known today, and deservedly so. While the book's title sounds like a toolbox of Machiavellian life-hacks, it's actually a remarkable little guide to virtuous and other-focused living. Carnegie's teaching is less about learning tricks to smooth-talk your way into success and more about the moral payoff that comes from truly living well.
 
#3: Living with the Himalayan Masters (Swami Rama)
 
It is fashionable today to see ""truth"" as synonymous with empirics and science. I've found that Eastern philosophy can help correct our thinking and restore a more holistic perspective. In Living with the Himalayan Masters, Swami Rama probes pressing questions about truth and enlightenment by simply telling the story of his incredible life.
 
#4: The Way (Josemaría Escrivá)
 
A leader must stand on strong principles, regardless of faith or lack thereof. The Way by Josemaría Escrivá offers a go-to guide and spiritual handbook for living a moral life while also fulfilling the duties of leadership. Believers and non-believers alike stand to gain from Escrivá's moving words on serenity and sacrifice.

29092950651_10157857845835652,"Want to become a better leader? TED speaker and management thinker Margaret Heffernan shares her favorite leadership books, with her thoughts on why you should read them:

1) CREATIVITY INC by Ed Catmull
A common sense account of how PIXAR achieved so much so fast. No nonsense, it is full of great insights into the kind of leadership that makes everyone successful. 

2) TEAM OF TEAMS by Stanley McChrystal
I don't think business is war, but McChrystal has achieved such high level collaboration across silos and feuding organisations that any leader can learn from him. This is the far opposite of command-and-control, so be prepared to shift some stereotypes.

3) GIVING VOICE TO VALUES by Mary Gentile
Many so-called leaders are just excellent sheep; true leaders are the people - at any level of an organisation - who think for themselves and speak out. This book offers excellence guidance for how to do so effectively. 

4) GIVE AND TAKE by Adam Grant
An excellent argument demonstrating that great leaders give, think deeply about others and appreciate that nobody succeeds alone. An excellent way to undo all the competitive nonsense you might have learned from school.
